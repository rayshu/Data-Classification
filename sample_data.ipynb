            " In April 2019, a DynCorp International (DI) team from the Patuxent River Naval Air Station program traveled to Ingalls Field in Hot Springs, Virginia, to test the Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasure (DAIRCM) system in AH-1Z and MH-60S aircraft. The objective of the detachment was to evaluate the DAIRCM, an improved missile countermeasure system, to determine if the systemâs performance was ready for the next phase of testing and fielding. In addition to DI maintenance, the detachment team consisted of about 30 people from NAVAIR, Atlantic Test Range and the Center for Countermeasures, among others. Ingalls Field is an excellent airfield to test with very little traffic on the tip-top of a mountain with terrain sharply dropping off into valleys to the east and west. A challenge that comes with testing on the top of a mountain where field elevation is 3,790 feet, however, is the weather. During the April detachment, the weather varied from 75 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny to driving rain and dense fog with temps barely climbing out of the 40âs. Of course, the day when the MH-60 was due for a full round of torque checks the team was battling heavy rain and visibility down to 100 feet. Although major maintenance was completed on the aircraft prior to detachment, subsequent torque checks on every fastener and driveshaft coupling from the main transmission to the intermediate gearbox were required. This covers a lot of bolts, most of which are very difficult to access, requiring the DI maintainers to contort on top and sometimes inside the aircraft. âMaintenance like this is no small task in the dry hangar back home at Patuxent River,â said Charlie Grogan, DynAviation Navy lead. âYet our maintenance team executed on the flight line, on the top of a mountain, in the driving elements.â While the rest of the detachment planned the next flight events or analyzed data from the comforts of the hotel, the DI team worked for a full day in the driving rain. Through dedication, skill and resolve, the team got the job done and returned the aircraft to an up status for test execution the next day. The weather cleared, the MH-60 flew, and the detachment team was able to successfully collect and deliver the needed data to bring a more capable system to the fleet. âThe magnitude of the work performed by the DI maintenance personnel in the elements and the attitude with which they met their task stands out as a highlight of our time on the mountain,â said a U.S. Navy lieutenant from the detachment. \n",

            " Navigating the various permissions and licenses to operate in a foreign country can be daunting. DynCorp Internationalâs Afghanistan Operations team is a group of eleven employees that support almost all our programs in Afghanistan. Their special support ranges across many different areas including Security, Personal Security Transport (PST), Tax, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan (MoFA), Administration, and Visa/Liaison support. Much of their work allows the programs in Afghanistan to meet the rule of Afghan law and to ensure that the laws and rules are applied properly and correctly.  These team members interact with the various Afghan ministries, ensuring visas and MoFA reference numbers are delivered and processed on time and that comprehensive tax situations are dealt with accurately and correctly. Additionally, the team, led by security director Glen Lewis, ensures that whenever there is an incident, timely and accurate information is disseminated across all channels and levels of DynCorp International.  One of the most important challenges this team faces is renewing the Services International LLC/Risk Management Company (SIL/RMC) license each year. Without the license or a letter bridging to the next license, a company can no longer provide RMC services to its customers â in short, the company cannot conduct certain types of business in Afghanistan. Mr. Zubair Wahabzai, the Visa/Government Liaison specialist, took on this difficult challenge even after the Ministry of Interior Counterterrorism Department (MoICT) insistedÂ it would not be willing to give any type of bridging letters to any RMC companies in Afghanistan. After multiple trips around the city of Kabul, including daily trips to the MoICT Department to meet with very senior leaders, his constant engagement, coupled with a lot of finesse, resulted in DynCorp International receiving the very first, highly sought-after bridging letter.  \n",

            " On the Naval Test Wing Pacific (NTWP) program at Point Mugu, California, DynCorp International (DI) employee Wilfredo âWillieâ Dumaop performed his routine foreign object debris (FOD) sweep of Bloodhound 303 of the U.S. Navy Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 30 (VX-30). âIt was just another routine FOD sweep,â said Willie, DI Quality Assurance (QA) representative. âThen I noticed something hidden behind the pilotâs rudder pedals.â Mr. Dumaop discovered a critical piece of foreign debris, a Stratus inverter power plug, behind the pedals. âWithout his diligent efforts and attention to detail, this piece of equipment could have easily fouled vital safety of flight controls resulting in significant damage or even loss of life,â said the U.S. Navy VX-30 Maintenance Officer. âMr. Dumaop found this missing piece of equipment even before the aircrew or duty officer were able to communicate the potential of hard FOD being adrift in the cockpit or even on the aircraft.â âWillie Dumaop displayed an exemplary commitment to the ideals of safe and effective maintenance, which are the foundation of Naval Aviation,â continued the maintenance officer. âHis actions display an example for all to emulate.â For his achievements to improving safety, Mr. Dumaop received a VX-30 Safety Professional award. âIâm proud of Willie for his commitment to safety and his attention to detail, and would like to congratulate him for this most deserved award,â said Bob Sanford, Point Mugu assistant site manager and QA director. About DIâs NTWP Program: DI provides organizational-level aircraft maintenance and logistics support on aircraft, systems/subsystems, aircrew systems, SAR equipment, and Support Equipment (SE) for assigned aircraft (rotary, fixed, lighter-than-air, unmanned), aircraft on-site for project testing, transient aircraft, FMS aircraft, loaner aircraft, training aircraft, and leased aircraft. Work is performed at NAVAIR Point Mugu, located at Naval Base Ventura County, California supporting P-3 and C-130 aircraft and Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) at China Lake, California supporting F/A-18A-G, AV-8, T-39 and SH-60 aircraft. \n",

            " Over the last decade, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) has received more than $1.3 million dollars of support through DynCorp International (DI) employee and corporate donations. The âRed Shirt Friday â Support the Troopsâ campaign alone has generated $135 thousand dollars in contributions from DI employees who purchased a red shirt to wear in support of the sacrifice of our servicemen and women throughout the world. DIâs Journey of Hope charity golf tournaments raised an additional $358 thousand through the sponsorships of DI suppliers, partners and employees. TAPS has supported many DI families since 2010, and in 2014, DI became the first private company to form an official partnership with TAPS to provide support to families of fallen DI personnel. Through this agreement, TAPS and DIâs Employee Assistance Program (EAP), designed to support DI employees and their families, work together to provide survivors of DI employees comfort and care through comprehensive services and programs including peer-based emotional support, case work assistance, connections to community-based care, and grief and trauma resources. DI has lost eighty-five teammates who were supporting U.S. foreign policy objectives. Watch Bonnie Carroll, TAPS founder and president, thank the people of DI in a brief, two-minute video. About TAPS The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) is the national organization providing compassionate care for the families of Americaâs fallen military heroes. When a member of Americaâs armed forces dies, TAPS is on the front lines providing compassionate care to the families left behind. Since 1994, TAPS has assisted over 80,000 surviving family members, casualty officers and caregivers who are grieving the loss of a military loved one, regardless of the geography or the circumstances of their death. \n",

Through this program, DI provides services for the Very Important Person Special Air Mission (VIPSAM) including aircraft maintenance, munitions, base supply and fuels in support of aircraft assigned to the 11th Wing and 89th Airlift Wing. âThis award is due entirely to the maintenance teamâs dedication and hard work,â said Craig OâNeal, Andrews Support Division, division manager. âAnd, theyâve pulled this off an incredible 15 years in a row.â The Diamond Award is the highest corporate award and includes both individual and corporate recognition. The award recognizes completion by 100 percent of an organizationâs eligible maintenance technicians of specialized, continuous training in aircraft systems, regulations and FAA rules over a 12-month period. In addition to the Diamond Award, which is presented to the company, each mechanic receives an Aviation Maintenance Technician award based on the number of training hours logged. âThis is the last time that the team can compete for this award under the VIPSAM name since the contract was divided into five separate programs (Executive Airlift, Rotary Maintenance Wing, Supply and Fuels, Munitions, and Transient Alert) this year,â added Craig. âThe team looks forward to continuing its truly amazing run of earning this prestigious award in the future under the Executive Airlift and Rotary Maintenance Wing service contracts.â \n",

            " The DynCorp International (DI) teams may have had more fun playing tournaments with their mini-golf greens than constructing them! The results are in from Julyâs DynFun activity, a miniature golf course construction contest. Teams worked inventively to build an individual putt-putt hole to incorporate into a DI-wide virtual golf course spread throughout the globe. The team on LOGCAPâs NTC program in Fort Irwin, California, built a putt-putt hole symbolizing their base in the desert. It included course features representative of many elements of their location: the historical Painted Rocks near the main gate, the High Mobility, Multi-Purpose, Wheeled Vehicle that DI maintains, the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier that DI also maintains, the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter to represent the DI Air Traffic Controllers, orange cones to represent the Vehicle Issue Yard and Rotational Unit Field Maintenance Area where vehicles are transferred to/from DI for test, repair & inspection, the ammunition can representing the Theatre Ammunition Supply Point, the brake rotor and exhaust pipe to represent other maintenance facilities, and finally, the cactus, donkeys and coyotes to represent the desert. The Accounts Payable team in Fort Worth, Texas went with a tropical luau party theme, featuring pool noodle guides, a tiki windmill, a metal filing rack tunnel, a pool float trap and a hibiscus flower ramp. They had an honor system on scorecards emphasizing fair play for their tournament prize. Alliance Security and Facilities in Fort Worth, Texas set up a Team dysFUNctional hole featuring an Edward Snowden and Leonard Moss starting tee with vintage cartoon burglars and insider threat âshadow manâ tube obstacles, with the finish in a DI Mailroom mailbox. At the McLean, Virginia office, team Corporate Security, Facilities & Real Estate created a carnival-game type putt-putt green with three alternative scoring options, the ultimate goal score being Security Superstar! They played the DI Security Open Mini Golf Tournament, which resulted in a four-way tie. A shootout was conducted among the winners, and Dorian Amstel resulted victorious with a Security Awareness medallion. Corporate Human Resources in Fort Worth, Texas, created green âDyn O Miteâ with a prehistoric theme. The putt-putt hole featured an erupting volcano, plastic bin water feature with mini boulders, velociraptor and T-rex obstacles, tropical pterodactyl, and a whiteboard backdrop with dry-eraser artwork. Congratulations to our winners, a tie between Human Resources and Alliance Security & Facilities. Both teams pushed their creative limits while staying within the contest size guidelines! All five of our terrific putt-putt green designing teams will receive a prize for their innovative creations.

            " This month, employees from DynCorp Internationalâs (DI) McLean, Virginia and Fort Worth, Texas offices collected dresses, shoes and accessories to donate to the USO of Metropolitan Washington-Baltimore (USO-Metro). USO-Metro is a nonprofit organization chartered by Congress, and dedicated to âserving those who serve, and their familiesâ in Washington D.C., Maryland and Northern Virginia. With the help of thousands of devoted volunteers, USO-Metro provides programs and services for active duty troops and their families at area military hospitals, USO Centers, USO airport lounges and a Mobile USO. Most branches of service have at least one anniversary ball or recognition âgalaâ each year. These special events can be intimidating and uncomfortable considering the etiquette and protocol associated with attending these functions. USO-Metro puts on a full day event, called Project Cinderella, which empowers women with interactive workshops on beauty and etiquette. It culminates with the women choosing from a selection of donated items, both a formal gown and accessories. This program is designed to help offset the costs of expensive military balls and other formal functions. In total, DI collected 37 dresses, 11 pairs of shoes, 4 purses and 27 articles of jewelry. \n",

            " DynCorp International (DI) hosted students from the National Defense University (NDU) at the McLean, Virginia office on Friday, April 12.  The students are part of the National Defense Universityâs competitive Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy. The nearly year-long curriculum prepares select military officers and civilians for leadership roles and success in developing national security strategy. Graduates are taught skills that can be used to better evaluate, marshal, and manage resources in the execution of military strategies. Many graduates of the program go on to hold leadership positions throughout the government and become executives in industry. Topics varied from an overview of what DI does, to specific program details, to finance. One area of concentration was DynCorp Internationalâs ability to stand up high-performing, rapid response teams that offer unique, tailored solutions. For example, there were questions about how DI approaches complex tasks like responding to natural disasters when resources can be scarce and needs are ever-changing. The group was also interested in learning how DI successfully implements large scale programs quickly while maintaining our high-quality standards and our companiesâ core values.  The seventeen scholars represented a diverse group with a wide array of experience and included members of U.S. Armed Forces, select inter-agency civilians, and representatives from Tanzania, Croatia, Italy, and Bosnia and Herzegovina armed forces. Attendees hold ranks in the military including Commanders, Lieutenants, Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels. The group heard from three presenters, Jim Cassella, SVP Business Development; Janet Oliver, SVP Business Development; and Robert Tillery, SVP Operations. We look forward\n",

In July of 2014 Idaho will return its non-football sports to the Big Sky Conference and football to the Sun Belt Conference. The university's official colors are silver and gold, honoring the state's mining tradition. Because these metallic colors in tandem are not visually complementary for athletic uniforms, black and gold are the prevalent colors for the athletic teams, with an occasional use of silver, similar to Colorado, whose official colors are also silver and gold. When Idaho moved out of the Big Sky to the Big West in 1996, the yellow \"Green Bay\" gold was changed to metallic \"Vegas\" gold. Yellow gold and black were the colors used by the most of the varsity teams from 1978Ã¢ÂÂ96, initiated by first-year head football coach Jerry Davitch's new uniforms for 1978. Conference affiliations. UI will leave the Western Athletic Conference in July 2013 after a large defection of members to different conferences. (The WAC dropped football after the end of the 2012-13 season.) The Vandals football team will be a FBS independent member for the 2013 season before joining the Sun Belt Conference in 2014, while the other teams will rejoin the Big Sky Conference after leaving in 1996.  UI joined the WAC in July 2005, moving from the Big West, which it had joined in 1996 to move back to Division I-A after 18 years in I-AA. Because the Big West discontinued football after the 2000 season, the UI was a \"football-only\" member of the Sun Belt for four seasons (2001Ã¢ÂÂ04).  Prior to July 1996, UI competed in the Big Sky Conference for 33 years; it was a charter member in 1963. The Big Sky has been a Division I-AA conference since I-AA's formation in 1978, but from 1963Ã¢ÂÂ77, the conference was a \"college division\" (later Division II) for football. Although a charter member of the Big Sky, Idaho maintained its \"university division\" (Division I) status, with its additional football scholarships, by playing a non-conference schedule of Division I teams. An exception came in August 1967, when the football program was involuntarily dropped to the college division for two seasons. Idaho was elevated back to university status in July 1969 and continued as Division I when the three numbered divisions were formed in 1973. Five seasons later in 1978, the Vandals were dropped to the new Division I-AA, as the Big Sky moved up from Division II. From 1922-58, Idaho competed with the original eight schools of the Pac-12 as a member of the Pacific Coast Conference. The PCC disbanded in the spring of 1959; Idaho competed as an independent for four years until the Big Sky was launched in 1963, though it did not play a conference schedule in football until 1965. Teams. The University of Idaho sponsors teams in seven men's and nine women's NCAA sanctioned sports: Men's Intercollegiate Sports Women's Intercollegiate Sports Track and field. Dan O'Brien, a hurdler on the UI track team in the late 1980s, won the gold medal in the decathlon at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, as well as multiple World Championships. He received his bachelor's degree in 1993, and the outdoor track and field stadium where O'Brien trained for these world titles was named for him in September 1996. Joachim Olsen of Denmark, the 2004 Olympic bronze medalist in the shot put, competed for the Vandals from 1999Ã¢ÂÂ2003, winning the NCAA outdoor championship in 2000. He was a 10-time All-American and never finished worse than third in the shot put in eight career NCAA indoor and outdoor appearances. Angela Whyte of Canada was a four-time NCAA All-American and five-time Big West champion at Idaho, where she helped lead the womenÃ¢ÂÂs team to 2001 and 2003 Big West team championships. She also earned Big West Female Athlete of the Year honors in 2001 and Big West Female Track Athlete of the Year honors in 2003. She was a member of Canada's 2004 and 2008 Olympic track teams. Baseball. Intercollegiate baseball was played at Idaho through the 1980 season. During the first six years of the Big Sky Conference, the Vandals won four titles, in 1964, 1966, 1967, and 1969, under two head coaches, Wayne Anderson and John G. Smith. Two of those teams, 1966 and 1969, advanced to within one round of the College World Series, falling in the District 7 finals, today's \"Super-Regionals\" (Sweet 16). The 1966 Vandals, led by senior pitcher Bill Stoneman with a 0.45 ERA, entered the post season with a 31-7 record. They traveled to Greeley and eliminated Colorado State and Air Force, but then fell at Tucson to Arizona. With newly promoted head coach John G. Smith, the 1967 team won the Big Sky, but lost in the first round of the NCAA playoffs at Air Force. The 1969 team finished the regular season at 30-7 and 10-2 in the Big Sky. Idaho swept two from Air Force at home in Moscow to advance, then lost at Mesa to host Arizona State, the eventual CWS champion. The Big Sky expanded to eight teams in 1971, all with baseball, and split into two divisions with a three-game playoff to determine the champion. The two Montana schools soon dropped the sport and Boise State was moved to the Northern Division with Idaho and Gonzaga for 1973. In May 1974, the Big Sky announced its discontinued sponsorship of baseball (and four other sports). Southern division champion Idaho State dropped their team weeks later and three-time conference champion Weber State would follow. The three Northern division schools (Idaho, Boise State, Gonzaga) joined the new Northern Pacific Conference (NorPac) for the 1975 season. (The NorPac included the larger baseball programs in the Northwest outside of the Pac-8, including Portland State, Portland, Seattle U., Puget Sound, and later, Eastern Washington.) Ken Schrom of Grangeville was selected in the tenth round of the 1973 MLB Draft as a high school senior, but opted for college. Also a quarterback for the football team, he pitched for the Vandals for three seasons until selected in the 1976 MLB Draft following his junior year.  After six seasons in the NorPac, both Idaho and Boise State discontinued baseball as a varsity sport following the 1980 season, citing budget constraints. Facilities. The University of Idaho has numerous on-campus facilities for the athletic program. The primary facility is the Kibbie Dome, a 16,000 seat indoor stadium for football, basketball, indoor tennis, and indoor track. Since 2001, massive black curtains have encircled the basketball seating configuration and the arena is called the \"Cowan Spectrum,\" with a capacity of 7,000. Underneath the football turf is a five-lane, track and nine tennis courts. East end additions to the Kibbie Dome house the athletic department offices, locker rooms, weight room, and training facilities. The Kibbie Dome's concrete grandstands opened in October 1971 upon the site of the wooden Neale Stadium (1937Ã¢ÂÂ68). (photo) An outdoor stadium for four years, it was fully enclosed in 1975; its playing surface sits at an elevation of above sea level. The historic Memorial Gymnasium (1928) is the home for women's volleyball, and also hosts early season basketball games. South of the \"Mem Gym\" is the Swim Center and the P.E. Building (formerly the new \"Women's Gym\"), which houses practice gymnasiums; these facilities were completed in 1970. The Mem Gym formerly had a pool in its basement. MacLean Field, the campus' original athletics area, was on these grounds, south of the Memorial Gym, with the spectators on the eastern embankment. Football was played here from 1914 until Neale Stadium opened in 1937; the baseball team called MacLean home for another three decades, until the construction of the College of Education building displaced the infield after the 1966 season.(aerial campus photo - circa 1940) Prior to 1940, the baseball infield at MacLean was in the opposite (southwest) corner and lacked infield grass. It was covered by the athletic field house in 1949, which was razed following the enclosure of the Kibbie Dome in 1975. The new baseball diamond was constructed at the north end of campus and first used in April 1967, and named for Guy Wicks in May 1969. Other outdoor facilities include the 18-hole championship UI Golf Course, directly south of the Kibbie Dome. The first nine holes debuted in 1937 and the second nine opened in 1970; the 1949 clubhouse was replaced in 1969. West of the Kibbie Dome is the 400-meter (437.4 yd) outdoor track and field stadium, opened in early 1972 and named for newly crowned Olympic champion decathlete Dan O'Brien in September 1996. A concrete grandstand at the finish line in the southeast corner seats approximately 1,000. The track complex was fully refurbished in 2011 and hosted the WAC outdoor championships in 2012. In addition, there are outdoor athletic practice fields on the grounds directly east of the Kibbie Dome. Formerly, these grass fields were for varsity football practice only. SprinTurf (similar to FieldTurf) and lighting was installed in 2005 and the fields are now available for intramurals and general recreation. Six outdoor tennis courts are east of these fields, west of the P.E. Building, and four more are on the lower Administration Lawn. At the spacious northwest corner of campus is the Guy P. Wicks baseball field, soccer field, and intramural fields, named in 1969 for the Moscow High and UI graduate. Wicks (1902Ã¢ÂÂ68) was a Vandal baseball player in the early 1920s, a head coach in two sports in the 1940s, and later an associate dean of students. Mascot. IdahoÃ¢ÂÂs athletic teams go by a name earned nearly a century ago by a basketball team coached by Hec Edmundson, whose teams played defense with such intensity and ferocity that sports writers said they Ã¢ÂÂvandalizedÃ¢ÂÂ their opponents. The mark made by that 1917 team went far deeper than wins and losses on the court. In 1917, Harry Lloyd \"Jazz\" McCarty Ã¢ÂÂ a writer for the student newspaper, the Argonaut Ã¢ÂÂ tagged the team with a new nickname in a pregame write-up: \"The opening game with Whitman will mark a new epoch in Idaho basketball history, for the present gang of 'Vandals' have the best material that has ever carried the 'I' into action.\" McCartyÃ¢ÂÂs indirect suggestion stuck. By 1921, McCarty and Edward Maslin Hulme, the dean of the College of Liberal Arts, succeeded in their push to have Vandals officially adopted as the nickname for Idaho teams. The current mascot is Joe Vandal. Rivalries. Washington State. Since returning to Division I-A status for football in 1996, Idaho has rekindled its rivalry with Washington State, eight miles (13ÃÂ km) to the west in Pullman. The annual game, usually played at Martin Stadium in Pullman, was renewed in 1998 after just two meetings in two decades, and is referred to as the \"Battle of the Palouse.\" The Cougars hold an immense advantage in the series (70-18-3 .786), but the Vandals did win back-to-back meetings in 1999-2000, following 14 straight Cougar victories from 1966-98. The last game played on the Idaho side of the border in this series was in 1966, a mudbath won by WSU. This game followed consecutive Idaho victories in 1964-65, which had been preceded by nine straight Cougar wins. Two of the recent games played in Pullman (1999 and 2001) were designated as Idaho \"home games\" to help reach existing NCAA minimum attendance requirements. The 2004 game was a designated Idaho home game for revenue purposes. The 2003 game was played in Seattle at Seahawks Stadium. The three games played in Pullman from 2005-07 were all WSU home games. The last game in the series was played in 2007, a 45-28 WSU victory, their seventh straight over the Vandals. At the request of Vandals head coach Robb Akey, a former WSU assistant who became the Vandal head coach in 2007, the game will be played occasionally rather than annually. The next game is currently scheduled for the 2013 season. Boise State. Boise is 300 highway miles (480ÃÂ km) south of Moscow, and many UI students are from the Treasure Valley (greater Boise area), the major population area of the state. Idaho had a major in-state rivalry with Boise State since 1971; BSU joined the Big Sky in 1970 but the football teams did not meet that season. BSU and UI moved to Division I-AA in 1978 and to Division I-A in 1996, joining the Big West. BSU was 8Ã¢ÂÂ2Ã¢ÂÂ1 in the first 11 meetings, including five in a row from 1977Ã¢ÂÂ81. Idaho immediately followed with 12 straight wins from 1982Ã¢ÂÂ93 and won 15 of 17 before Boise State began the last 12-game winning streak in 1999, in which BSU dominated the Vandals. The composite score for the most of the last dozen games was 613Ã¢ÂÂ213, an average BSU victory margin of over 33 points per game, which ranged from 14 to 58 points. Boise State won 13 of 15 games over Idaho since both teams moved up to Division I-A (now FBS) in 1996. Beginning in 2001, the winner of the football game was awarded the Governor's Trophy; Boise State won it every year. Boise State left the WAC after the 2010 season and joined the Mountain West Conference, leaving no future for the football in-state rivalry. As of February 2013, the 2010 game was the last in the series and no future games are currently scheduled. Montana. For most of its history, Idaho had an intense interstate rivalry with the University of Montana in Missoula, approximately 200 miles (320ÃÂ km) east. The teams have met for football 84 times (second only to the 91 games with Washington State). Idaho and Montana first played in 1903, and played every year from 1914-95 (except during the war years of 1918 and 1943Ã¢ÂÂ44, when neither school had a team). Montana was also a member of the Pacific Coast Conference until 1950, and a fellow charter member of the Big Sky in 1963. Idaho leads the overall series 55-27-2 (.667), but Montana has dominated the rivalry since 1991. The IdahoÃ¢ÂÂMontana rivalry will be renewed as a conference rivalry in non-football sports when Idaho rejoins the Big Sky in 2014. The teams have played just five times since Idaho moved back up to Division I-A in 1996, with the I-AA Montana Grizzlies winning the last four, most recently in 2003. Since the departure of Idaho, Boise State, and Nevada from the Big Sky to Division I-A in the 1990s, the Montana Grizzlies have been the dominant I-AA (now FCS) football program in the West. The winner of the Idaho-Montana game claims the Little Brown Stein trophy. Idaho State. Idaho and Idaho State have enjoyed a moderate rivalry since 1963, the year ISU became a university and both schools joined the new Big Sky conference as charter members. The schools are separated by a significant distance, Pocatello in southeastern Idaho is over 500 road miles (800ÃÂ km) from Moscow. Idaho has traditionally been dominant in this rivalry, particularly in football. The football rivalry was most intense and equal in the 1970s and 1980s, but the teams have played sparingly since the Vandals left the Big Sky in 1996, with Idaho winning all four contests. They last met in 2008 in Moscow, with Idaho winning 42-27. Since 1988, the Vandals have won 11 of the last 12 meetings. This is another rivalry that will be renewed as a conference matchup outside of football when Idaho returns to the Big Sky.  \n",

            " Robert L. May  Robert Lewis May (27 July 1905 Ã¢ÂÂ 10 August 1976) was the creator of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. Life and work. May grew up in an affluent, secular Jewish home in New Rochelle, New York. He had a brother and two sisters. One of the sisters, Evelyn May, is the grandmother of the well-known economist Steven D. Levitt, of Ã¢ÂÂFreakonomicsÃ¢ÂÂ fame. Another sister, Margaret, married (Jewish) songwriter Johnny Marks in 1947. May graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Dartmouth College in 1926. Robert MayÃ¢ÂÂs parents were hard hit by the Great Depression (1929) and lost their wealth. Sometime in the 1930s, May moved to Chicago and took a job as a low-paid in-house advertising copywriter for Montgomery Ward. In early 1939, MayÃ¢ÂÂs boss at Montgomery Ward asked him to write a Ã¢ÂÂcheeryÃ¢ÂÂ Christmas book for shoppers and suggested that an animal be the star of the book. Montgomery Ward had been buying and giving away coloring books for Christmas every year and it was decided that creating their own book would save money and be a nice good-will gesture. MayÃ¢ÂÂs (Jewish) wife, Evelyn, had contracted cancer in 1937 and was quite ill as he started on the book in early 1939. May \"drew on memories of his own painfully shy childhood when creating his Rudolph stories.\" He decided on making a deer the central character of the book because his then 4-year-old daughter, Barbara, loved the deer in the Chicago zoo. He ran verses and chapters of the Rudolph poem by Barbara to make sure they entertained children. The final version of the poem was first read to Barbara and his wifeÃ¢ÂÂs parents. Evelyn May died in July, 1939. His boss offered to take him off the book assignment in light of his wifeÃ¢ÂÂs death. May refused and completed the poem in August, 1939. The Rudolph poem booklet was first distributed during the 1939 holiday season. Shoppers loved the poem and 2.4 million copies were distributed. War time restrictions on paper use prevented a re-issue until 1946. In that year, another 3.6 million copies were distributed to Montgomery Ward shoppers. In 1946, May received an offer from a company that wanted to do a spoken-word record of the poem. May could not give his approval (and be compensated) because Montgomery Ward held the rights to the poem. In late 1946 or early 1947, Sewell Avery, the companyÃ¢ÂÂs president, gave the copyright rights to the poem to May, free and clear. The spoken-word version of the poem was a big sales success. In 1947, Harry Elbaum, the head of a small New York publishing company, took a chance and put out an updated print edition of the Rudolph (poem) book. Other publishers had passed on the book, believing that the distribution of millions of free copies had ruined the market. The book was a best seller. In 1948, MayÃ¢ÂÂs brother-in-law, Johnny Marks, wrote (words and music) an adaptation of Rudolph. Though the song was turned down by such popular vocalists as Bing Crosby and Dinah Shore, it was recorded by the singing cowboy Gene Autry. \"Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" was released in 1949 and became a phenomenal success, selling more records than any other Christmas song, with the exception of \"White Christmas\". In 1941, May married another Ward employee, Virginia, and had five children with her. She was a devout Catholic, and Robert May possibly converted to Catholicism during the marriage. He is buried in Saint Joseph Cemetery in River Grove, Illinois. May wrote two sequels to \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\". The first is mostly in prose (except that Rudolph speaks in anapaestic tetrameter), written in 1947 but only published posthumously as \"Rudolph's Second Christmas\" (1992), and subsequently with the title \"Rudolph to the Rescue\" (2006). The second sequel is entirely in anapaestic tetrameter like the original: \"Rudolph Shines Again\" (1954). May also published four other children's books: \"Benny the Bunny Liked Beans\" (1940), \"Winking Willie\" (1948), \"The Fighting Tenderfoot\" (1954), and \"Sam the Scared-est Scarecrow\" (1972).  \n",

            " IndyCar Series  The IZOD IndyCar Series is the premier level of American open wheel racing. The current championship, founded by Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George, began in 1996 as a competitor to CART known as the Indy Racing League (IRL). Citing CART's increasing reliance on expensive machinery and overseas drivers, George aimed to create a lower-cost alternative. In 2008, the IndyCar Series merged with the Champ Car World Series (formerly CART). The series is sanctioned by IndyCar. Overview. Series name. Due to the legal settlement with CART, the Indy Racing League was unable to utilize the name \"IndyCar\" until the beginning of the 2003 season. For 1996-1997, the series was simply referred to as the \"USAC Indy Racing League\", with no genre designation. For 1998-1999, the series garnered its first title sponsor, and was advertised as the \"Pep Boys Indy Racing League\". The contract was not renewed after the second year. In 2000, the series sold its naming rights to Internet search engine Northern Light for five seasons, and the series was named the \"Indy Racing Northern Light Series\". After only two seasons, however, the sponsorship agreement ended when Northern Light reevaluated its business plan and ended all sponsorships. The league reverted to the \"Indy Racing League\" name for the 2002 season, with no title sponsor. The IndyCar Series name was officially adopted beginning in 2003, as the series was now legally entitled to use it. In 2006, IndyCar forged an alliance with Simmons-Abramson Marketing (headed by Gene Simmons of the hard rock band Kiss), promising to be \"actively engaged in the league's marketing, event, public relations, sponsorship, merchandising and branding effortsÃ¢ÂÂfrom its IndyCar Series to the venerable Indianapolis 500\". Simmons also co-authored the new IndyCar theme song, \"I Am Indy\". For the 2008 season, DirecTV served as a presenting sponsor, and the series was briefly advertised as the \"IndyCar Series in DIRECTV HD\". IZOD was announced as the series title sponsor beginning on November 5, 2009. Exact financial terms were not disclosed but the deal is worth at least $10 million per year and runs for at least 5 years. Television. In the UK, the IndyCar Series races have all their broadcasts on the Sky Sports family of networks, however since the launch of BT Sport in August 2013 races are shown on one of the two BT branded channels or ESPN. The viewing figures of the IndyCar races in the UK outnumber that of the NASCAR races which are also broadcast on Sky Sports. The IndyCar Series also had highlights of all the races on the channel Five British terrestrial channel and Five USA, but has since been discontinued since the 2009 season. In February 2013, Sportsnet announced that it would become the official Canadian broadcaster of the IndyCar Series beginning in the 2013 season in a five-year deal with the series. The new contract will include broadcasts on the Sportsnet regional networks, Sportsnet One, and City, along with mobile coverage and French rights sub-licensed to TVA Sports. Additionally, Sportsnet will also originate coverage from the Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, Indianapolis 500, and Honda Indy Toronto with Bill Adam, Todd Lewis, and Rob Faulds. Canadian driver Paul Tracy will also join Sportsnet as an analyst. Car history and current specifications. The IndyCar Series is not an open formula. The league controls and specifies the chassis and engine manufacturers that teams are allowed to use each season. The league's choice of manufacturers are changed every three years. Currently, Dallara provides the chassis to all teams, with Honda and Chevrolet providing the engines. Lotus provided engines in 2012 but left at the end of the season. Chassis. 1996 to 2011. In the series' first season (1996), 1992 to 1995 model year CART chassis built by Lola and Reynard were used. The current Indycar came into being in 1997. Tony George specified new technical rules for less expensive cars and production-based engines. The move effectively outlawed the CART chassis and turbocharged engines that had been the mainstay of the Indianapolis 500 since the late 1970s.  Starting with the 2003 season, the series rules were changed to require chassis manufacturers to be approved by the league before they could build cars. Prior to that, any interested party could build a car, provided it met the rules and was made available to customers at the league-mandated price. In total, four manufacturers have built IndyCar chassis. Dallara began producing Indycars for the 1997 season. The Dallara and G Force chassis were relatively evenly matched over their first few seasons, but eventually the Dallara began to win more races. This caused more teams to switch to the Dallara, further increasing their success. Currently, all full-time teams now use the Dallara chassis. Dallara was also tabbed to build the Firestone Indy Lights machines. Dallara has won eight of the twelve Indy 500 races they have entered. After the withdrawal of factory support from Panoz Auto Development, they are the only supplier of new chassis. The G Force chassis was introduced in 1997, and won the 1997 and 2000 Indy 500 races. In 2002, ÃÂlan Motorsport Technologies bought G Force, and the chassis was renamed \"Panoz G Force\", and then shortened to \"Panoz\" in 2005. In 2003 a new model was introduced, and it won the Indy 500 in 2003-2004, and finished second in 2005. It fell out of favor starting in 2005, and by 2006 only one finished in the top ten at Indy. Little factory support was given to IndyCar teams after that point, as Panoz concentrated on their DP01 chassis for the rival Champ Car World Series. By 2008, only one Panoz saw track time, an aborted second weekend effort at Indy, that resulted in Phil Giebler being injured in a practice crash. Given the age of the cars, and three-year cycles, it is unlikely that any further efforts will be seen with these chassis. Riley & Scott produced IndyCar chassis from 1997 to 2000. Their initial effort, the Mark V, was introduced late in the 1997 season, severely limiting its potential market. It also proved to be uncompetitive. After Riley & Scott was purchased by Reynard, an all-new model, the Mark VII, was introduced for the 2000 season. It won in Phoenix, the second race of the season (driven by Buddy Lazier), but was off the pace at Indy and was quickly dropped by its teams. Falcon Cars was founded by Michael Kranefuss and Ken Anderson in 2002 as the third approved chassis supplier for the 2003 season. One rolling chassis was completed and shown, but it was never fitted with a working engine and never ran. No orders were ever filled. Superficially, IndyCar machines closely resemble those of other open-wheeled formula racing cars, with front and rear wings and prominent airboxes. Originally, the cars were unique, being designed specifically for oval racing; for example, the oil and cooling systems were asymmetrical to account for the pull of liquids to the right side of the cars. The current generation chassis however, are designed to accommodate the added requirements of road racing. Because of a preexisting schedule conflict, the ChampCar World Series spec Panoz DP01, with a Cosworth engine, was run in an IndyCar Series points event in the 2008 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. 2012. Starting in 2012 the series moved to using a common chassis supplied by Dallara. Using a single supplier to supply chassis was introduced as a cost control method, and IndyCar has negotiated a fixed cost of $349,000 per chassis. The new specification of chassis also improved safety, the most obvious feature being the partial enclosure around the rear wheels. This chassis is intended to support multiple aerodynamic kits, but the introduction of these has been delayed until 2014 with teams citing costs.  After the events of the 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championships the chassis was named DW12 in honour of Dan Wheldon. Fuel. Methanol. At its inception, the IRL used methanol racing fuel, which had been the de facto standard in American open wheel racing since the 1964 Indianapolis 500 Eddie Sachs - Dave MacDonald crash. Methanol had long provided a safer alternative to gasoline. It had a higher flash point, was easily extinguishable with water, but burned invisible. With the IRL's introduction of night races in 1997, the burning of methanol fuel was visible for the first time, seen with a light blue haze. With this in mind, in an effort to make it more visible in case of fire during daylight hours, additional mixtures were placed in the fuel. As a safety feature, the methanol would burn with a color. Ethanol. In 2005, driver Paul Dana brought the sponsorship of the Ethanol Promotion and Information Council (EPIC) to his IndyCar team. EPIC is a consortium of ethanol producers that advocate the increased use of ethanol. EPIC was anxious to address public concerns that ethanol use led to engine damage and poor performance when used in street cars. As a marketing effort, it was believed that sponsoring an IndyCar could be used as a tool to promote education and awareness of ethanol use, and to curb the spread of erroneous information. Dana was killed in a crash in 2006, but the IRL had already begun a transition to ethanol fuel. For the 2006 season, the fuel was a 90%/10% mixture of methanol and ethanol. Starting in 2007, the league advertised \"100% Fuel Grade Ethanol\", the first competitive series to utilize renewable fuel. The mixture is actually 98% ethanol and 2% gasoline for races held in the United States. It was provided by Lifeline Foods of Saint Joseph, Missouri. The additives satisfied the U.S. government's requirements that the alcohol be unfit for human consumption, and added visible color in case of a fire. The 2010 SÃÂ£o Paulo Indy 300, held in Brazil - outside of the U.S. regulations - utilized a full E100 mixture, the first instance in the sport. To compensate for the gain of power due to the use of ethanol, the displacement was decreased back to 3.5L. Since ethanol gets worse fuel mileage than methanol, the fuel tanks in the car were increased. Compared to methanol, human contact with the current ICS fuel is much less harsh, and the fumes much less irritating. The fumes are often compared with the sweet smell of apple cider or apple cobbler. Unlike methanol, ethanol is not caustic and does not cause chemical burns when it comes in contact with skin. It is also less polluting when spilled compared to methanol. On May 2010, Sunoco became the official fuel of the series starting in 2011, running through 2014. Sunoco will work with APEX-Brasil and UNICA to provide ethanol for the series. Engines. The initial 1996 IRL season, as well as the first two races of the 1996-97 season, featured engines with specifications left over from the rival CART series competition. Those chassis/engine combinations were essentially under the same rules utilized by teams which participated in the 1995 Indianapolis 500, which was sanctioned by USAC. V-8 powerplants were allowed the typical 45 inHg of pressure boost. The Menard-Buick V6 engine used in 1996, however, was an updated powerplant from the 1995 version. In addition, the V-6 stock block engines (Buick-Menard) were allowed 55 inHg of boost at all races, instead of just at Indianapolis. During the CART era, V-6 stock blocks were only allowed 45 inHg at all races outside of Indy, which was a decided disadvantage and left the engine out of favor. Ford-Cosworth reluctantly provided support to teams wishing to run their older-spec engines in the IRL, a major point of contention for CART management, to whom Ford-Cosworth was an official engine supplier. The Ilmor Mercedes V-8 engine, also a mainstay CART powerplant, was permitted, but the only time it was used was a one-off at the 1996 Indy 500 by Galles Racing. Starting in 1997, IRL cars were powered by 4.0 L V8, methanol-burning, production-based, normally aspirated engines, produced by Oldsmobile (under the Aurora label) and Nissan (badged as Infiniti). Per IRL rules, the engines sold for no more than $80,000, and were rev-limited to 10,500 rpm. They produced around . The engine formula was changed with the 2000-2004 formula. The displacement was dropped from 4.0L to 3.5L, and the requirement for the block to be production-based was dropped. This formula was used through 2003. In 2004, in the wake of several crashes including the fatal crash of Tony Renna and the severe crash of Kenny BrÃÂ¤ck, the displacement was further reduced to 3.0L to curb top speeds. Infiniti's engines, though reliable, were significantly down on power compared to the Auroras in 1997, leading many of the teams that had initially opted for the Infiniti to switch. By the end of the 1998 season, only a handful of low-budget teams were using the Infiniti. However, early in the 1999 season, Cheever Racing, a well-funded team, was brought on to develop the engine with team owner Eddie Cheever expanding the team to two cars and bringing on his brother Ross Cheever as a test driver. By 2000, the engine had improved markedly and Cheever captured the marque's first win at Pikes Peak International Raceway. However, despite the improved success, few teams made the switch to the Infiniti and the company left the series after the 2002 season to focus on powering the league's new Infiniti Pro Series (now Firestone Indy Lights). As part of General Motors' discontinuance of the Oldsmobile name, the Olds engine was rebadged as the Chevrolet starting with the 2002 season. However, the effort could not compete with the Toyota and Honda programs starting in 2003. In August 2003, Chevrolet announced to the public its \"Gen IV\" motor, a rebadged Cosworth motor for competition. At the time, Cosworth was owned by Ford. On November 4, 2004, Chevrolet stated that it would be ending its IRL engine program effective with the end of the 2005 season, citing costs that exceeded value, according to then GM Racing Director Doug Duchardt, \"The investment did not meet our objectives.\" In 2003, Toyota came to the IRL from the rival CART series. Toyota won their first race in Miami, as well as the Indianapolis 500 and the series title. However, Toyota had just one podium in the last seven races of 2004, and only Penske Racing fielded competitive Toyota-powered cars in 2005. In November 2005, Toyota company officials announced the company's withdrawal from American open-wheel racing and the immediate discontinuation of its IRL program, coinciding with its entrance into NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series in 2004, and its discontinuation of its IMSA program. Honda also came to the IRL in 2003, and by 2005 was clearly the dominant engine manufacturer. Starting in 2006, they became the only engine manufacturer in the IndyCar Series, and will continue in that capacity through 2011. The Honda V8 engine was designed and produced by Ilmor, which is part owned by Roger Penske. Since the IndyCar Series has only one engine manufacturer, that manufacturer concentrates on minimizing engine failure and minimizing costs instead of defeating rivals. As such, the engines are moderately de-tuned. The engines have proven themselves to be quite durableÃ¢ÂÂthere have been no engine failures at Indy from 2006 to 2010, which also lowers the number of crashes. Most of the engines, including those used for the Indy 500, are used for multiple races and are intended to last 1,200ÃÂ miles (1,931ÃÂ kilometers) between rebuilds. The Honda engines are only available via lease arrangement from Honda, which, for the 2010 full season, costs $935,000 U.S. per season, per car. Honda techs travel with the series, as well as attending all IRL team testing sessions. IndyCar Series engines are rev-limited to 10,300 rpm and produce approximately 650 hp. The valve train is a dual overhead camshaft configuration with four valves per cylinder. The crankshaft is made of alloy steel, with five main bearing caps. The pistons are forged aluminum alloy, while the connecting rods are machined alloy steel. The electronic engine management system is supplied by Motorola, firing a CDI ignition system. The engine lubrication is a dry sump type, cooled by a single water pump. Specifications (2007-2011). Engine. Source: IZOD IndyCar Series The future of IndyCar. On July 14, 2010, the series announced that Dallara had been chosen over four other bids to replace the current Dallara chassis in 2012. Dallara will provide a rolling chassis that will serve as the base of the car. Teams will choose an aero kit (sidepods, engine covers, front/rear wings) built by any manufacturer (including the teams themselves) to complete the chassis. Aero kits must be approved by the IndyCar Series, undergo safety testing, be available to all teams, and will have a maximum price of $70,000. Cars will be badged based on their aero kit manufacturers and not the chassis manufacturer. The Dallara name will not be a part of the car's name (e.g. if Team Penske produces their own aero kit, they will drive a \"Penske IndyCar\", not a \"Penske Dallara\"). A team will not be able to run more than 2 aero kits in a season. As part of the deal, Dallara will create a manufacturing facility in the town of Speedway, Indiana to build the new cars (part of the deal includes tax breaks from the state and local governments). Dallara's rolling chassis will be sold to teams for $345,000 each (45% less than what is charged for the current chassis). The Governor of Indiana also indicated that the first 28 chassis purchased by Indiana-based teams will be sold for $195,000 each. The new chassis will be 1380ÃÂ lbs; 185-lbs. (84ÃÂ kg) lighter than the current model. The new chassis will include an anti-interlocking design which is intended to prevent tire-on-tire contact with the potential to launch a car into the air. The new open engine formula will use 2.2ÃÂ liter twin-turbocharged V6 Engines to run provided it can be tuned to produce the full range of 550-750ÃÂ HP. The formula would allow hybrid systems, KERS system similar to Formula 1, and other engine enhancements. The \"push to pass\" feature in 2012 will allow a limited horsepower gain up to 100ÃÂ HP as opposed to the current \"overtake assist\" which only provides 20ÃÂ HP. Firestone announced that they would step down as tire provider and the end of the 2011 season, but it was announced by IZOD IndyCar Series CEO Randy Bernard on March 11, 2011 that Firestone has accepted to stay on with the IndyCar Series as sole tire supplier through 2013 season, after team owners in the series voted to keep Firestone on as the sole tire supplier earlier in the week due to safety concerns allowing a new tire supplier. On October 19, 2011, the IndyCar Series announced that the new Dallara chassis would be named in honor of Dan Wheldon, who did much of the testing for the new chassis prior to his death. Seasons. Following the merger of CART/Champ Car into the Indy Racing League in 2008, the IRL acquired all intellectual property and historic records. Individual discipline trophies. Starting in 2010, the series began recognizing sub-set championship trophies alongside the season championship. The two primary disciplines of IndyCar (ovals and road courses) were named after respective legends of the sport: A. J. Foyt and Mario Andretti, respectively. The discipline trophies were created as the series moved closer to a 50/50 split of ovals and road courses, and to encourage incentive for part-time entries - specifically those that might prefer to compete in one discipline over the other. This arrangement also creates a reasonable opportunity for a team to employ the services of two drivers for one season entry. A team could hire a specialist for ovals and a specialist for road courses, whom combined would maintain the entry's total owner points but individually work towards their own separate disciplines. Note that street courses are included as part of the road racing discipline.  \n",

Birth in the Philippines to foreign parents does not in itself confer Philippine citizenship, although RA9139, the Administrative Naturalization Law of 2000, does provide a path for administrative naturalization of certain aliens born on Philippine soil (\"Jus soli)\". Belgium and France have similar provisions under their respective nationality laws. Citizenship by birth. , with no significant changes expected, Philippine nationality law provides that a person becomes a Philippine citizen by birth if Citizenship by naturalization.

            " Takeichi Nishi  Colonel Baron was an Imperial Japanese Army officer, equestrian show jumper, and Olympic Gold Medalist at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. He was a tank unit commander at the Battle of Iwo Jima and was killed in action during the defense of the island. Family and early life. Nishi was born in the Azabu district of Tokyo. He was the illegitimate third son of TokujirÃÂ Nishi, a \"danshaku\" (baron under the \"kazoku\" peerage system). His mother was not married to TokujirÃÂ and was forced to leave the house soon after giving birth. His father had various high level positions in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Imperial Privy Council, leading up to Ambassador to China's Qing Dynasty during the Boxer Rebellion.  Nishi went to Gakushuin pre-school and, while in elementary school, repeatedly got into fights with students of nearby Bancho elementary school. In 1912, at the age of 10, he succeeded to the title of Baron upon the death of his father. In 1915, he entered Tokyo First Junior High School (now Hibiya High School) in accordance with the dying wishes of his father; his classmates included Hideo Kobayashi, future pre-eminent literary critic, and Hisatsune Sakomizu, who would be Chief Cabinet Secretary in 1945. In September 1917, Nishi entered Hiroshima Army Cadet School, a military preparatory school established on Prussian models, and in 1920 took courses at Tokyo Central Cadet Academy. One of his classmates was Masanobu Tsuji, formerly head student of the Nagoya Academy. He completed his studies at Central Cadet School in six months in April 1920, due to the reorganization of the military schools, and began courses at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. Midway through his studies, he was attached to the First Cavalry Regiment based in Setagaya, Tokyo. In 1924, he graduated from the Academy, the 13th of the 19 students in his class, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in October. He went on to the First Cavalry after graduating from Army Cavalry School. He was promoted to lieutenant in October 1927. Uranus and Olympics competition. In 1930, Nishi encountered what would be his favorite horse, Uranus, while in Italy. As the army wouldn't pay for the horse, Nishi bought Uranus with his personal funds. Nishi and Uranus competed in competitions around Europe, doing well. In 1932, when Nishi was a first lieutenant, they participated in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, winning a gold medal in show jumping individual. This remains Japan's only Olympic medal to date in an equestrian event. His victory broke through the general hostility towards Japan that followed from the Mukden Incident and invasion of Manchuria. Westerners, especially Americans, referred to him as Baron Nishi. He was also popular among Japanese Americans, who were ostracized by American society in this period. During his stay in Los Angeles, Nishi became the topic of conversation both for his love of driving convertibles around town and for becoming part of the social circle led by movie star couple Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.  After the Olympics, he was reassigned to the 16th Narashino Cavalry Regiment and promoted to be a cavalry instructor at the regimental school with the rank of captain, which he was promoted to in August 1933.  Nishi and Uranus participated in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany but Nishi fell off his horse mid-course. There is speculation this was intentional and done for the benefit of host country Nazi Germany, with whom Japan would sign the 1940 Tripartite Pact, forming the Axis Powers. The 1936 Show Jumping individual event gold medal was won by Germany. Following this, Nishi was reposted to the Tokachi Subdivision of the department responsible for supply of military horses. He was promoted to major in March 1939. War years to Iwo Jima. In this period, Japan was cutting its cavalry forces and forming tank regiments. Nishi was reassigned the regimental commander of the 26th Tank Regiment, based in Mudanjiang, in northern Manchukuo on defensive duties. He eventually gained the rank of lieutenant colonel in August 1943.  In 1944, the 26th Tank Regiment was reassigned to the defense of Iwo Jima under the command of Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi. On July 18, 1944, while en route to Iwo Jima, the ship transporting the regiment was struck by torpedoes fired by submarine . While only two soldiers were killed, all 28 of the tanks in the regiment were lost. Nishi briefly returned to Tokyo to obtain replacement tanks, and eventually received 22 of them. While there, he borrowed the car of Daijiro Kawashima, future CEO of Daihyaku Insurance (eventually bought out by Manulife Financial), a close friend and a son of the Kawasaki Heavy Industries \"zaibatsu\". When he had a chance, he visited his horse Uranus, who remained at the BajikÃÂen Horse Grounds, Setagaya. Battle of Iwo Jima. On Iwo Jima in 1945, Nishi commanded the 26th Tank Regiment under the Ogasawara Corps (IJA 109th Division). He would walk about the island wearing his HermÃÂ¨s brand riding boots and carrying his favorite crop. The regimental headquarters, which was located near the village of Maruman, was moved to the eastern part of the island when the battle began. Due to the topography of the island, some of the medium Type 97 Chi-Ha and light Type 95 Ha-Go tanks were placed in hull defilade (buried up to their turrets) and used as fortified emplacements, in particular, against the American M4 Shermans.  After extensive air and naval gunfire bombardment, the United States Marine Corps launched an amphibious assault on Iwo Jima starting February 19. The American forces, who knew that Nishi was an enemy commander, broadcast daily appeals for him to surrender, stating that the world would regret losing \"Baron Nishi\"; Nishi never responded to those appeals. The American intelligence officer responsible for this attempt was Sy Bartlett of the 315th Bomber Wing out of Guam, who would later write the novel and film screenplay \"Twelve O'Clock High\". In 1966, Bartlett visited Nishi's widow in Tokyo and paid his respects at Yasukuni Shrine. Death. The circumstances of Nishi's death are unknown and subject to competing theories. One theory is that he found himself in the midst of enemy forces on the morning of March 21 and was killed by machine gun fire while moving to the regimental headquarters. Another is that he and his aide killed themselves with their pistols near GinmyÃÂsui or Futagoiwa. Yet another is that he was burnt to death by American flamethrowers on March 22, or that he and several subordinates carried out a final assault and were killed in action. John C. Shively, in his novel \"The Last Lieutenant\", recounts a story told by his uncle in which his platoon fires upon a group of Japanese soldiers during the night. In the morning, a body resembling Nishi's was found wearing riding boots and jodhpurs. Shively's uncle was almost certain that this was the body of Nishi. Nishi was 42 years old at the time of the battle. Legacy. Nishi was posthumously promoted to the rank of colonel. His son Yasunori Nishi (currently vice president of the Association of Iwo-Jima), succeeded him as the 3rd Baron Nishi. His hereditary title was abolished during the American occupation of Japan after the war.  ÃÂno states, \"Few people comprehended him and only Uranus understood him.\"  Uranus died one week after Nishi. In 1990, Uranus was commemorated at the War Horse Memorial in the History and Folklore Museum in Honbetsu, HokkaidÃÂ. In popular culture. In the 2006 film \"Letters from Iwo Jima\", Baron Nishi was played by Korean-Japanese actor Tsuyoshi Ihara. The film portrays Nishi as being close friends with General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, but in reality, there was antagonism between the two. Nishi ignored Kuribayashi's prohibition on using precious water to wash tanks, as well as the general's orders to punish soldiers who did so. Regardless, the popularity (mainly in Japan) of both men as defenders of Iwo Jima grew. An anecdote repeated by Kakehashi Kumiko in the February 2006 issue of \"Bungei Shunju\" magazine is that in the final days of the battle, as the number of commanding officers who refused to put their men in caves increased, Nishi agreed that they should go out and fight together. In the 2006 movie, Nishi uses some of the scarce medical supplies on a wounded US Marine he is questioning. ÃÂno Kaoru's biography of Nishi gives credence to this as an actual event. The film also portrays Nishi as having taken his own life after being wounded and blinded during the battle. His landmark gold medal win at the 1932 Summer Olympics is involved in a sub-plot to J.J. Lask's 2013 film \"The Uncrowned King\".  \n",

            " Christmas kettle  Christmas kettle is The Salvation Army's most famous street campaign. It is most recognized during the Christmas season through its volunteers who stand outside of businesses and play or sing Christmas carols, or ring bells to inspire passersby to place donations of cash and checks inside the trademark red kettles. History. A tradition on the \"kettle\" started in 1891, in San Francisco, by Captain Joseph McFee. Salvation Army officer Captain Joseph McFee, resolving to provide a free Christmas dinner to the poor of San Francisco, remembered a sight he saw in Liverpool, England. From his days as a sailor McFee remembered a large pot displayed on the Stage Landing, called \"Simpson's Pot.\" The pot took in donations put in by passersby. Taking this idea, McFee asked for permission from San Francisco city authorities to place a crab pot and tripod at the Oakland ferry landing. The kettle - and McFee's call of \"Keep the Pot Boiling!\" - drew in passengers and donations. The idea spread, and is in use by many Salvation Army charities worldwide. Innovations from the crab pot have included self ringing kettles, booths that play Christmas music, and Credit Card capabilities. The Christmas kettle campaign is traditionally kicked off each year during the halftime of the Dallas Cowboys Thanksgiving Day football game. Anonymous gold coin donations. A tradition has developed in the United States where, in some places, gold coins are anonymously inserted into the kettles in which the bell ringers collect donations. The tradition appears to have started in the Midwest when the first known drop of a gold coin was put into a kettle in Crystal Lake, Illinois in 1982. Since this drop, many others have taken to dropping not only gold coins, but also other bullion and rare coins, gold medals, and jewelry. Some of the finds include: In addition, Salvation Army kettles have also collected worthless items like candy, lint and other assorted trash.  \n",

            " Battle of the Barracks  The Battle of the Barracks () was a series of engagements between the Croatian National Guard (\"Zbor narodne garde\" Ã¢ÂÂ ZNG, later renamed the Croatian Army) and the Croatian police on one side and the Yugoslav People's Army (\"Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija\" Ã¢ÂÂ JNA) on another in SeptemberÃ¢ÂÂNovember 1991. The battle took place around numerous JNA posts throughout Croatia, starting with Croatian forces blockading the JNA barracks, weapons storage depots and other facilities. It formally began on 14 September, and its objective was to neutralise the JNA positions in the ZNG-held territory and secure arms and ammunition to the poorly equipped ZNG. The Battle of the Barracks was an escalation of the conflict between Croatian authorities and the Croatian Serbs who openly revolted in August 1990 and the JNA efforts to preserve the Yugoslav federation. At the same time, Croatia made moves towards achieving its independence from Yugoslavia. The Battle of the Barracks briefly preceded the start of the JNA's campaign in CroatiaÃ¢ÂÂitself amended in early September to add relief of the blockaded barracks to the operation plans. However, the JNA's advance was largely curbed by the ZNG, and it relieved only few JNA facilities. The ZNG and the police captured small and isolated JNA posts, as well as a number of large weapons depots and barracks, including the entire 32nd (VaraÃÂ¾din) Corps of the JNA. The move provided the Croatian forces with a sizable stock of weapons, including 250 tanks, hundreds of artillery pieces and large supply of small arms and ammunitionÃ¢ÂÂproving crucial in defence against the JNA advances in the early stage of the Croatian War of Independence. Some of the JNA facilities surrendered without any fight, while others put up armed resistance to the takeover. In some places, this caused civilian casualties as the barracks were situated in urban areas. Legal charges of abuse or killing of captured JNA personnel, as well as charges with war crimes against civilian population were filed in Croatia, but most defendants remain at large. In November, the JNA and Croatia reached several agreements to end the blockade and pull out the JNA out of Croatia. The pullout was completed by 4 January 1992, except in areas around Dubrovnik, and on the islands of Vis and Lastovo. The JNA maintained its presence there until the summer of 1992. As the JNA withdrew from the areas it controlled in Croatia, it was replaced by the UN peacekeepers agreed upon by the Vance plan. Background. In 1990, following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions worsened. The Yugoslav People's Army (\"Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija\" Ã¢ÂÂ JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (\"Teritorijalna obrana\" Ã¢ÂÂ TO) weapons to minimize resistance. On 17 August, the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin, (approximately northeast of Split), parts of the Lika, Kordun, Banovina and eastern Croatia. Serbia, supported by Montenegro and Serbia's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo unsuccessfully tried to obtain Yugoslav Presidency's approval of a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991. The denied request, and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March, prompted the JNA itself to ask the federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency. Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies, the JNA was denied on 15 March. Serbian President Slobodan MiloÃÂ¡eviÃÂ, preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit, publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized authority of the federal Presidency. The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under MiloÃÂ¡eviÃÂ's control. By the end of the month, the conflict had escalated to the first fatalities. In early April, leaders of Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention of integration of the area under their control, viewed by the Government of Croatia as a breakaway region, with Serbia. In the beginning of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defence, Croatia doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was 3,000-strong special police deployed in twelve battalions adopting military organization of the units. In addition there were 9,000Ã¢ÂÂ10,000 regionally organized reserve police. The reserve police was set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies, but the reserve force lacked weapons. As a response to the deteriorating situation, the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard (\"Zbor narodne garde\" Ã¢ÂÂ ZNG) in May. This was achieved by amalgamation of the special police battalions into four all-professional guards brigades consisting at that point of approximately 8,000 troops combined, and their subordination to the Ministry of Defence headed by retired JNA General Martin ÃÂ pegelj. The regional police, expanded to 40,000 by then, was also attached to the ZNG and reorganized in 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions. However the guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully armed with small arms, while heavier weapons, as well as a command and control structure were lacking throughout the ZNG. The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to use of World War II weapons taken from museums and film studios. At the time, Croatian stockpile of weapons consisted of 30,000 small arms purchased abroad in addition to 15,000 previously owned by the police. A new 10,000-strong special police was established then to replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades. Prelude. Croatian view of the JNA's role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved in the JanuaryÃ¢ÂÂSeptember 1991. The initial plan of Croatian President Franjo TuÃÂman was to win support from the European Community (EC) and the United States for Croatia, and dismissed advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Capturing the JNA barracks and storage depots was first advocated by ÃÂ pegelj in late 1990. He urged TuÃÂman again to adopt the plan in early 1991, and in summer of that year while the JNA fought Slovenia's TO in the Ten-Day War in JuneÃ¢ÂÂJuly 1991. His calls were echoed by ÃÂ ime ÃÂodan, who replaced ÃÂ pegelj as the Defence Minister in July. ÃÂ pegelj remained in command of the ZNG though. TuÃÂman's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA. The ZNG was limited to defence even though actions of the JNA appeared coordinated with the Croatian Serb military. The impression was reinforced by buffer zones the JNA established after armed conflicts between the Croatian Serb militia and the ZNGÃ¢ÂÂthe JNA intervened after the ZNG lost ground, leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of territory they captured before the JNA arrived. Furthermore, the JNA provided some weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although the bulk of the weaponry was provided from the Serbia's TO and Ministry of Internal Affairs stocks. In July 1991, ÃÂ pegelj and ÃÂodan's demands were backed up by a number of Croatian Parliament members during a parliamentary debate. This led TuÃÂman to sack ÃÂodan the same month he was appointed the Defence Minister, and ÃÂ pegelj resigned his post on 3 August. Nonetheless, deteriorating situation in the east of Croatia, including JNA forces removing the ZNG from Baranja and intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci, as well as increasing losses and growing conviction that the JNA actively supports the Croatian Serb revolt, forced TuÃÂman to act. On 22 August, he issued an ultimatum to the federal Yugoslav authorities demanding the JNA to withdraw to its barracks by the end of the month. The ultimatum stated if the JNA failed to comply, Croatia would consider the JNA an army of occupation and take corresponding action. On 1 September, the EC proposed a cease-fire and a peace conference was accepted by TuÃÂman, despite his ultimatum demanding the JNA to return to its barracks by 31 August, and by the Yugoslav Presidency. The conference started on 7 September, but only four days later, the Croatian member and chair of the presidency, Stjepan MesiÃÂ, ordered the JNA to return to its barracks within 48 hours. The move was motivated by TuÃÂman's impression that the conference would drag endlessly while the ZNG loses ground. Even though the order was disputed by other members of the body, it gave Croatia a justification to openly confront the JNA. Timeline. Prime Minister Franjo GreguriÃÂ proposed TuÃÂman to implement ÃÂ pegelj's plan. According to General Anton Tus, TuÃÂman ordered the ZNG to capture JNA barracks on 12 September, only to rescind the order the next day. The order was reinstated on 14 September after Tus pleaded with TuÃÂman to authorize the move, arguing that the ZNG is running out of time. The same day, the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities it had access to, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. The move blockaded 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia, and numerous smaller facilities including border posts and weapons and ammunition storage depots. The blockade forced the JNA to amend its campaign in Croatia plans to accommodate the new development. Several JNA posts were attacked by the ZNG even before the blockade was officially sanctioned, largely in response to local battlefield situation. The first such incident was a failed attack on JNA barracks in Sinj on 25 August, in response to deterioration of ZNG positions in nearby village of Kijevo. On 3 September, the ZNG captured a barracks in Sisak, and on 13 September a weapons storage depot in GospiÃÂ area was captured amid fighting for control of the city. A total of 21 M-84AB tanks were captured in a ÃÂuro ÃÂakoviÃÂ factory in May. The tanks were supposed to be shipped to Kuwait, but a part of the shipment was kept by Croatia. Furthermore, a train transporting JNA weapons from Slovenia to Serbia was captured in Slavonski Brod on 21 August. The ZNG seized its first anti-aircraft, anti-tank weapons, and artillery pieces there, while adding to its small stock of mortars. The ZNG forces besieging the JNA facilities were largely drawn locally. Reinforcements deployed from other cities were relatively small. September. On 14 September, the same day the Croatian forces was ordered to blockade the JNA facilities, the ZNG and the police captured JNA barracks in PloÃÂe, one of several barracks in GospiÃÂ, and one in nearby PeruÃÂ¡iÃÂ. In OtoÃÂac, north of GospiÃÂ, the JNA garrison also came under attack as the ZNG started to assault the barracks in the town. Sopnica JNA depot near Zagreb was captured that day, as well as a border post manned by the JNA on the Hungarian border near PitomaÃÂa. In response to the blockade imposed against their barracks in Vukovar, the JNA dispatched a force to relieve the siege. The next day, the ZNG and the police captured a JNA depot near Popovec, west of Zagreb, and another near Slavonski Brod. At the same time fighting erupted around JNA facilities in VaraÃÂ¾din, and two JNA border posts were captured north of Virovitica. On 16 September, the Croatian forces captured one JNA barracks and another storage depot in Slavonski Brod, two barracks in Ogulin, while fighting started around a JNA post in OÃÂ¡tarije. In addition, ÃÂ½rnovnica missile base was captured, and JNA weapons storage facilities near Daruvar, OtoÃÂac, KriÃÂ¾evci and Virovitica. On 17 September, the Croatian forces captured JNA barracks in Daruvar, Ogulin, ÃÂakovec, KriÃÂ¾evci, Virovitica, PoÃÂ¾ega, as well as two JNA barracks situated in ÃÂ ibenikÃ¢ÂÂRogoznica area, and one in VaraÃÂ¾din. Also, a JNA depot was captured near Zagreb (Duboki Jarak). On 18 September, three additional barracks in VaraÃÂ¾din surrendered, an additional barracks near Rogoznica, all remaining JNA facilities in GospiÃÂ, two barracks in ÃÂakovo and a nearby weapons storage facility, a communications facility near GareÃÂ¡nica and dozens of border posts. On 19 September, ZNG clashed with the JNA garrison in Karlovac LogoriÃÂ¡te barracks, and captured a communications facility at Platak near Rijeka, and an additional JNA barracks and a storage depot in VaraÃÂ¾din, restricting the JNA to the barracks housing headquarters of the JNA VaraÃÂ¾din Corps. By 20 September, when the JNA launched a campaign against the ZNG encompassing entire Croatia, more than 60 JNA facilities in Croatia surrendered or were captured, including 15 barracks and 11 storage depots. Capture of the barracks continued in NaÃÂ¡ice, where JNA barracks surrendered on 21 September. The JNA VaraÃÂ¾din Corps surrendered the next day, providing the ZNG with a major weapons cache. In the first few days of the blockade, the Croatian forces also captured several small JNA posts in Split, but no large JNA facility in the city area. In mid-September, seven JNA facilities, including three barracks were captured in Zadar. The most significant among them was \"Turske kuÃÂe\" barracks, containing a large cache of small arms and ammunition. The Yugoslav Air Force carried out air strikes against the facility the next dayÃ¢ÂÂfollowing a pattern that was established at the timeÃ¢ÂÂto hinder removal of weapons from posts which JNA lost. On 23 September, a ZNG assault on a large JNA weapons storage site in Sveti Rok, located between GospiÃÂ and Zadar, failed. The two remaining JNA barracks under Croatian blockadeÃ¢ÂÂin Vinkovci and OsijekÃ¢ÂÂwere abandoned by the JNA by 26 September. The Osijek garrison managed to break out from the besieged barracks and join the JNA troops south and east of the city, while evacuation of the Vinkovci barracks was negotiated between Croatian authorities and the JNA. The negotiations were initiated after the JNA 1st Guards Mechanised Division reached Vinkovci on 25 September, forcing the ZNG to accept the evacuation. A JNA facility on the island of KorÃÂula surrendered its equipment to the ZNG on 26 September. On 29 September, the Croatian forces captured two barracks and three storage depots in and around Bjelovar after a day-long fighting, while the fourth storage facility was blown up by its commanding officer, JNA Major Milan TepiÃÂ. The explosion killed all defenders and 11 in the besieging force. It was heard away and caused damage in nearby villages. The same day, a weapons storage facility in Koprivnica and a border post near Virovitica were captured by the ZNG and the Croatian police. The JNA 73rd Motorized Brigade surrendered in Koprivnica the next day. On 14/15 September, Croatia seized DJÃÂ-612 landing craft from the Yugoslav Navy in Vela Luka shipyard while it was undergoing repairs, and sailed the vessel the same night into the Cetina River. On 16Ã¢ÂÂ22 September, the Croatian forces captured \"Kuline\" barracks in ÃÂ ibenik and 15 Yugoslav Navy vessels based there, as well as further 19 vessels located in \"Velimir ÃÂ korpik\" shipyard, going through various stages of overhaul. The vessels, comprising approximately a quarter of the Yugoslav Navy assets, included: \"Vlado ÃÂetkoviÃÂ\" (RTOP-402) \"KonÃÂar\"-class fast attack craft (renamed \"ÃÂ ibenik\" (RTOP-21) later on), \"Velimir ÃÂ korpik\" (RÃÂ-310) \"Osa\"-class missile boat, \"Partizan II\" (TÃÂ-222) \"Shershen\"-class torpedo boat and \"Biokovo\" (PÃÂ-171), \"Cer\" (PÃÂ-180) and \"Durmitor\" (PÃÂ-181) \"Mirna\"-class patrol boats. Also, a ship in the final stages of construction was captured in the Kraljevica Shipyard the same month. She was launched in 1992 as \"Kralj Petar KreÃÂ¡imir IV\" (RTOP-11) missile boat. In September, seven coastal artillery bases were captured in area of ÃÂ ibenik, and on the islands of ÃÂ olta, BraÃÂ and KorÃÂula. October. On 3 October, the Croatian forces captured \"JoÃÂ¾a VlahoviÃÂ\" JNA barracks in Koprivnica, and a communications post and a border post near the city. The next day, JNA barracks in Sinj and its nearby land mine storage facility were abandoned after a negotiated agreement. In early October, two JNA artillery regiments based in \"ÃÂ epurine\" barracks near Zadar broke through a siege laid around their base and joined JNA attack on the city. By 5 October, Zadar was completely surrounded by JNA forces, and the situation prompted Croatian authorities in the city to seek a cease-fire and negotiations. The cease-fire was arranged the same day, while the negotiations, held on 7Ã¢ÂÂ9 October, brought about lifting of the JNA siege of Zadar and evacuation of the remaining JNA garrison and its equipment from the city. The evacuation, involving seven JNA facilities, started on 11 October and took 15 days. The agreement stipulated that the evacuated units would leave Croatian soil, and the JNA generally respected the obligation, even though 20 truckloads of weapons were left to Serb population in Zadar hinterland. In the wake of the bombing of Banski dvori of 7 October, Croatian authorities instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in Zagreb area if commanders on the ground considered that possible. The instructions resulted in no attacks in Zagreb itself, but JNA barracks in Samobor were captured by the Croatian forces on the day of the bombing. The declaration of the independence of Croatia came into force the next day. On 13 October, OÃÂ¡tarije JNA barracks were largely destroyed by the JNA and abandoned, and a JNA weapons storage facilities in Rijeka were damaged in a fire caused by a thunderstorm. Nonetheless, some weapons were taken away by the ZNG while the firefighters were called in to save individual storage structures. The next day, the JNA was moving the remaining weapons from the damaged storage elsewhere in the city. While a convoy of 18 trucks was moving through Rijeka, 15 vehicles carrying weapons were diverted and captured by the ZNG. At the same time, \"Borongaj\" JNA barracks in Zagreb were allowed to evacuate in return for free passage of a humanitarian aid carrying convoy to Vukovar, where the battle to control the city was in progress. November. After a period of siege with little or no activity, the JNA forces in \"LogoriÃÂ¡te\" barracks in Karlovac area broke through the blockade towards the JNA-held territory to the east of the city on 4Ã¢ÂÂ6 November. Even though the Croatian forces besieging the barracks were more numerous, the JNA had superiority in armour and artillery supporting the operation. After it was abandoned by the JNA, the barracks still contained weapons which were taken away by the Croatian troops until November 13. The Croatian Army (\"Hrvatska vojska\" Ã¢ÂÂ HV), as the ZNG was renamed in early November, captured \"Jamadol\" barracks and storage facility in Karlovac on 4 November, while the fighting around the \"LogoriÃÂ¡te\" was in progress, and the following day, the HV captured JNA barracks and several weapons storage facilities in Delnice. The attacks were ordered to capture ammunition needed by the HV as its stockpile was running low. On 8 November, Davorin Rudolf, representing Croatian authorities, and the JNA Lieutenant Colonel General Marijan ÃÂad, commanding officer of the 13th (Rijeka) Corps, made an agreement to evacuate the corps personnel and equipment from Croatia. The agreement, made after negotiations supervised and supported by the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) would later serve as a model for subsequent similar agreements elsewhere in Croatia. ÃÂad made the agreement at his own initiative, with support of the JNA Fifth Military District, after receiving an order from the JNA Chief of Staff Colonel General Blagoje AdÃÂ¾iÃÂ to destroy the JNA facilities in Rijeka and attack industrial plants and infrastructure in or near the city. The agreement was not affected by the HV capture of \"Draga\" barracks and weapons stored there on 9 November. The JNA 13th (Rijeka) Corps started to evacuate by sea to Montenegrin ports on 18 November. Following negotiations, the JNA evacuated Jastrebarsko barracks on 13 November. The garrison left, under ECMM escort, to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The next day, an agreement was made in village of ÃÂ½itniÃÂ near DrniÃÂ¡ regarding evacuation of the JNA from ÃÂ ibenik. Yugoslav Navy bombardment of Split, ÃÂ olta and BraÃÂ of 15 November, in response to loss of \"Mukos\" (PÃÂ-176) patrol boat, and the subsequent Battle of the Dalmatian channels appeared to have derailed the ÃÂ½itniÃÂ agreement. Another agreement was signed in ÃÂ½itniÃÂ on 21 November by Rudolf and the JNA Maritime-Military District commanding officer, Major General Nikola MladeniÃÂ regarding evacuation of the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy from the ÃÂ ibenikÃ¢ÂÂSplit area and surrender of the confiscated TO weapons stored there. It was followed by another agreement to the same effect in Split two days later by MladeniÃÂ and Croatian Admiral Sveto Letica, defining that the pullout should be completed within 30 days. The agreement also provided for a cease-fire in the northern Dalmatia and lifting of Yugoslav Navy blockade of the Croatian coast. The agreement did not include evacuation of the Yugoslav Navy from its bases on the islands of Vis and Lastovo though. Throughout the process, tensions remained high, and the JNA made contingency plans to break through from Knin to ÃÂ ibenik and Split and relieve siege of its forces thereÃ¢ÂÂcodenamed Operation Coast-91 (\"Operacija Obala-91\") and Operation Hurricane-91 (\"Operacija Orkan-91\") respectively. On 22 November, Croatian authorities and the JNA signed an agreement on evacuation of all remaining JNA forces from Croatia. The agreement was signed in Zagreb, by HV Colonel Imra AgotiÃÂ and Lieutenant Colonel General Andrija RaÃÂ¡eta in presence of the ECMM monitors. The agreement was confirmed the next day in Geneva, Switzerland, when the Geneva Accord was signed by TuÃÂman, MiloÃÂ¡eviÃÂ and the Yugoslav defence minister, JNA General Veljko KadijeviÃÂ. Aftermath. The ZNG quickly captured isolated JNA facilities and the depots, as well as several major posts, seizing large quantities of weapons. Those included the entire stocks of the JNA 32nd (VaraÃÂ¾din) Corps and nearly all the weapons previously confiscated from the Croatia's TO. The JNA lost control of eight brigades, including one armoured and two mechanized brigades, and three artillery regiments, while additional forces in the JNA Fifth Military District and the Military-Maritime District remained pinned down by the blockade. Significance of the Battle of the Barracks was reinforced by introduction of a United Nations (UN) arms embargo on 25 September. The Battle of the Barracks resulted in a very large increase of ZNG/HV capabilitiesÃ¢ÂÂallowing complete arming of its existing units, raising of additional 40Ã¢ÂÂ42 brigades and fielding 200,000 troops in addition to 40,000 police by the end of the year. In the battle, the ZNG/HV captured 250 tanks, 400Ã¢ÂÂ500 heavy artillery pieces, 180,000 small arms and 2ÃÂ million tonnes of ammunition. In addition, 3,000 officers left the JNA and joined the HV. While there are is no information on the total number of troops or casualties involved on either side, the JNA garrisons in Croatia were significantly undermanned at the time. The JNA order of battle developed in 1980s specified a handful of battalions at full combat readiness in Croatia. Those were elements of the 140th Mechanised Brigade in Zagreb, the 31st Armoured Brigade in Dugo Selo, just to the east of Zagreb, the 12th Proletarian Mechanised Brigade in Osijek, the 11th Marine Infantry Brigade in ÃÂ ibenik and the 139th Marine Infantry Brigade in Pula. In 1990, the \"A\" classification, requiring 60Ã¢ÂÂ100% troop levels, was assigned to the 4th Armoured Brigade in Jastrebarsko, a battalion of the 622nd Motorised Brigade in Petrinja, the 13th Proletarian Motorised Brigade in Rijeka, and the 265th Mechanised Brigade in Bjelovar and Koprivnica. The 221st Motorised Brigade, based in Knin was reinforced with \"A\" class armoured and mechanised battalions. In addition, an armoured battalion was added to the 622nd Mechanised Brigade, and a mechanised battalion to JNA garrisons in Vinkovci and Vukovar each in May 1991. Likewise, Croatian forces were strained between the blockade and manning the positions held against the JNA and Croatian Serb militias elsewhere. Surrendered JNA troops were either transported to Serbia, exchanged for prisoners of war captured elsewhere, or provided civilian clothing and released. Both in 1991 and years later, ÃÂ pegelj criticised TuÃÂman's decision to disregard his advice to attack the JNA barracks earlier than SeptemberÃ¢ÂÂspecifically during the Ten-Day War in Slovenia in JuneÃ¢ÂÂJuly 1991. He argued that an earlier move, preempting deterioration of strategic situation in Croatia, would serve Croatian defensive needs the best. Furthermore, he claimed that the JNA would be unable to respond in force because it would need two months to mobilise required forces and that all prerequisites for a decisive victory against the JNA were met. Tus thought that TuÃÂman kept postponing the blockade because of the international community exerted a pressure against confrontation with the JNA, while Zdravko Tomac, deputy prime minister of a national unity government at the time, and later an opposition leader, stated that while ÃÂ pegelj's view was militarily correct, TuÃÂman's position was politically better. KadijeviÃÂ conversely claimed that the JNA would have fared better if Croatian forces confronted it earlier on because JNA capabilities declined during the summer of 1991. Vance plan. The JNA campaign in Croatia ended in a stalemate, leading the belligerents to accept an internationally supervised ceasefire, formulated as the Vance planÃ¢ÂÂa result of a diplomatic mission by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Cyrus Vance, aided by United States diplomat Herbert Okun, and Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations for Special Political Affairs Marrack Goulding, to Yugoslavia aimed at a negotiated end of hostilities in Croatia. The plan proposed a ceasefire, the protection of civilians in specific areas designated as UN Protected Areas and deployment of a UN force to Croatia. The Vance plan provided for the end of the Croatian blockade of the JNA barracks, the withdrawal of all JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the implementation of a ceasefire and the facilitation of delivery of humanitarian aid. The parties to the accord also agreed to the deployment of a UN peacekeeping mission in Croatia, later initiated through the subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution 721 of 27 November. As a consequence of organizational problems and breaches of the last ceasefire agreement, the UN peacekeepers only started to deploy on 8 March 1992. Evacuation of the JNA. The JNA continued to evacuate following the Geneva Accord. The remaining seven JNA facilities in Rijeka area were evacuated throughout November, and the last barracks evacuated were those in Trsat on 10 December. In ÃÂ ibenik, the JNA evacuated two barracks and four depots from 25 November until 24 December, turning the confiscated Croatian TO weapons over to the HV on 10 DecemberÃ¢ÂÂbut the weapons remained in a sealed storage under ECMM supervision until 25 December, as required by the ÃÂ½itniÃÂ agreement. The bulk of the evacuation took place by rail via Knin, and a part of the force was moved by sea to Montenegro. The evacuation agreement required, as in case of Zadar evacuation, removal of the evacuated units from Croatian soil, but the JNA fulfilled that commitment only in a part. The \"Divulje\" base of the JNA near Trogir started to evacuate by sea on 4 December, after an additional agreement signed by Rudolf and MladeniÃÂ regulating surrender of the TO weapons to the HV and evacuation from the Lora naval base in Split. The evacuation was halted once again when it was determined that some of the TO weapons are missing from the JNA facilities in Split. The issue was resolved through an agreement of 18 December made between RaÃÂ¡eta and AgotiÃÂ, stipulating that the JNA would provide the HV with the missing weapons from its own stocks, and the evacuation resumed. Since the JNA did not have sufficient weapons to achieve that in Split, a Yugoslav Navy ship delivered of weapons and ammunition from Kumbor in Montenegro to Split on 1 January 1992. The last JNA forces left the area of Split on 4 January. Elsewhere in Croatia, the JNA also evacuated its facilities. Pullout from \"MarÃÂ¡al Tito\" and \"Kerestinec\" barracks in Zagreb started on 30 November, and was completed by the end of 1991. Istria was evacuated by the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy on 15 December, turning over the Croatian TO weapons to the HV. Quantity of the TO weapons turned over in Istria, where the JNA evacuated 78 facilities, was sufficient to arm two combat brigades. In December 1991, only minor clashes occurred around the JNA facilities that were still under the HV blockade, including a minor and unsuccessful HV attack on \"MekuÃÂ¡je\" barracks in Karlovac. Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment, the JNA stayed behind for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually pulled out from Croatia, JNA left their equipment to the Republic of Serbian Krajina, established in the JNA-held areas of Croatia on 19 December. The JNA and the Yugoslav Navy kept their bases on Vis and Lastovo until early June 1992 before pulling out unilaterally. The JNA maintained positions near Dubrovnik until July, while the naval blockade of the city was lifted on 26 May 1992. War crimes. Croatian authorities charged deputy head of the Bjelovar police Operations department and three special police force members with death of five JNA prisoners and shooting of a civilian in the aftermath of the Bjelovar barracks surrender. They were acquitted after 12 years of legal proceedings, after the Supreme Court ordered their trial repeated twice. Head of Bjelovar crisis centre was also charged with war crimes in 2012, but his trial is still pending. Croatia also charged numerous JNA officers who held posts in the blockaded garrisons. In Osijek alone, 13 JNA officers were charged with war crimes against civilian population, including causing death of 307 and severe injuries to 171 persons, but none were arrested . There were war crime charges brought against JNA commander of the 32nd (VaraÃÂ¾din) Corps, General Vladimir TrifunoviÃÂ. He was charged by Croatia with deaths of six and wounding of 37 people. After a trial \"in absentia\", he was found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1991. Three years later, in 1994, TrifunoviÃÂ was charged in Yugoslavia with treason because he surrendered the entire JNA corps to the ZNG. He was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in prison. In early 1996, TrifunoviÃÂ was pardoned and released, and the Yugoslav authorities paid him 62,000 Euro compensation for spending nearly two years in a prison. In 2013, TrifunoviÃÂ formally requested re-trial in Croatia.  \n",
