href=\"https://www.torproject.org\">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>\\n\\t\\t<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>\\n\\t\\t<h4>Tails</h4>\\n\\t\\t<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org\">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>\\n\\t</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<div id=\"submit_help_tips\" class=\"submit_elem\">\\n\\t<div class=\"container\">\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"text-center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"submit_buttons btn-group\" role=\"group\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"#submit_help_contact\" class=\"btn-wl btn-wl-empty\">How to contact WikiLeaks?</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"#submit_help_tor\" class=\"btn-wl btn-wl-empty\">What is Tor?</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"#submit_help_tips\" class=\"btn-wl\">Tips for Sources</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"#submit_help_after\" class=\"btn-wl btn-wl-empty\">After Submitting</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t<h3>Tips</h3>\\n\\t\\t<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>\\n\\t\\t<div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href=\"#submit_help_contact\">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org\">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<div id=\"submit_help_after\" class=\"submit_elem\">\\n\\t<div class=\"container\">\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"text-center\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"submit_buttons btn-group\" role=\"group\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"#submit_help_contact\" class=\"btn-wl btn-wl-empty\">How to contact WikiLeaks?</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"#submit_help_tor\" class=\"btn-wl btn-wl-empty\">What is Tor?</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"#submit_help_tips\" class=\"btn-wl btn-wl-empty\">Tips for Sources</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"#submit_help_after\" class=\"btn-wl\">After Submitting</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t<h3>After</h3>\\n\\n\\t\\t<div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t<div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h4>2. Act normal</h4>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t<div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href=\"https://www.couragefound.org\">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n<div id=\"submit\" class=\"submit_banner\">\\n\\t<div class=\"container\">\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"page-header\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<h1>Submit documents to WikiLeaks</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t<a class=\"remove-button\" href=\"#\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-remove-circle\"></span></a>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed.

THE <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Explosive Ordnance Disposal\">EOD</span> TEAM ARRIVED ON SCENE AND SET UP A SAFE AREA AT    %%%.  THE LEAD VEHICLE IN THE PATROL WAS AN UNMANNED <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle Humvee\">HMMWV</span> WITH THE %%% IN THE SECOND VEHICLE.  THE %%% STATED THAT THE <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Improvised Explosive Device\">IED</span> DETONATED -%%% METERS AHEAD OF THE UNMANNED <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle Humvee\">HMMWV</span> ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE ROAD BETWEEN A LARGE OPENING IN THE BARRIERS.  THE TEAM REMOTELY CLEARED THE AREA OF SECONDARY DEVICES AND PROCEEDED TO CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF THE SITE.  BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE, A DETERMINATION OF WHAT THE <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Improvised Explosive Device\">IED</span> CONSISTED OF COULD NOT BE MADE.  THERE WAS NO FRAGMENTATION OR LEFT OVER RESIDUE TO INDICATE WHAT TYPE OF INITIATION SYSTEM THE DEVICE CONTAINED.  DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE BLAST SEAT CRATER, THE <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Explosive Ordnance Disposal\">EOD</span> TEAM LEADER ASSESSED THAT THE DEVICE CONTAINED APPROXIMATELY -%%% <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Pounds\">LBS</span> OF <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Unknown Bulk Explosives\">UBE</span>.  THERE HAVE BEEN TWO PREVIOUS ATTACKS AT THE SAME SITE.  THE FIRST ATTACK HAPPENED ON 15<span class=\"abbr\" title=\"april\">APR</span>09 AND THE SECOND HAPPENED ON 28<span class=\"abbr\" title=\"april\">APR</span>09.

THE FACT THAT THE <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Improvised Explosive Device\">IED</span> WENT OFF IN FRONT OF THE FIRST VEHICLE INDICATES THAT THE <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Improvised Explosive Device\">IED</span> MAY HAVE BEEN EITHER <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Reserve Component\">RC</span> OR <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Passive Infrared\">PIR</span> INITIATED.  ALTHOUGH THIS AREA IS HIGHLY KNOWN FOR COMMAND WIRE INITIATING SYSTEMS, ANOTHER ATTACK ON 19MAY09 ON <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Route\">RTE</span> %%% AT GRID    %%% WITH AN <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Improvised Explosive Device\">IED</span> THAT DETONATED AFTER THE LAST VEHICLE PASSED IT PRODUCING A SIMILAR RESULT OF NO <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Battle Damage Assessment\">BDA</span> AND LITTLE TO NO EVIDENCE, INDICATES THAT A NEW <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\">TTP</span> IN THIS AREA COULD POSSIBLY BE BEING TESTED.  THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO ANY VEHICLES, BARRIERS, OR BUILDINGS.  BECAUSE THIS SITE IS NOW FREQUENTLY BEING USED TO %%% <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Improvised Explosive Devices\">IEDS</span>, COMPLETELY BLOCKING OFF THE OPENING WITH ADDITIONAL BARRIERS WOULD BE ADVISABLE TO PREVENT FURTHER ATTACKS FROM THE SAME PLACE.  A SOIL SAMPLE WAS TAKEN FROM THE BLAST SEAT AND   %%% OVER TO WIT %%% FOR FURTHER EXPLOITATION.\\012\\012S2 ASSESSMENT: THIS ATTACK IS ASSESSED TO BE CONNECTED TO    %%% AND HIS JAM/FSG EFP CELL.

Though the vest was indeed operational and capable of detonating if a  %%% was added, the discovery of it in a field outside of  %%% village raises significant concerns that the informants could not speak to, including how it was discovered, who discovered it, and how they knew it was there at %%% at night.  Additionally, the informants claimed that there are two more %%% in the %%% area that   %%% in the future against <span class=\"abbr\" title=\"Coalition Forces\">CF</span> or the informants themselves.  What they failed to explain, however, is the discrepancy between the opportune discovery of one SVEST in an isolated field and their knowledge of more vests and their future use in the area.  To add to the lack of clarity, this is at least the fourth suicide vest that has been discovered in this area in the past two months, the other three were turned in through the Kirkuk ISF to an  %%%.  In all of these instances, there has been a lack of details sufficient to explain the discoveries and the suspected involvement of the same sources and informants.
