" Last week, DynCorp International’s (DI) Alliance office in Fort Worth, Texas welcomed Congresswoman Kay Granger for a visit. Congresswoman Granger represents the twelfth congressional district of Texas and won her twelfth term to serve in Congress in 2018. The district she represents is located in North Texas and encompasses parts of Tarrant and Wise counties and all of Parker county. Throughout her tenure, Congresswoman Granger has made a name for herself as a leader in national defense and global security. The congresswoman currently serves as ranking member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, overseeing the entire appropriations process. Prior to becoming ranking member, Granger was chairwoman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. As chairwoman, she directly oversaw fifty percent of all the appropriations spending and made addressing military readiness a top priority. During the congresswoman’s visit, she met with senior executives and held a town hall-style gathering in the lobby where she addressed DI employees. Throughout her visit, senior leadership highlighted DI’s many wins in 2019 and the overall success of the company. After meeting with senior leadership, the congresswoman was welcomed by a sea of red “Support the Troops” shirts in the Alliance office foyer. DI is grateful to Congresswoman Kay Granger for visiting and spending time with our employees to discuss issues that impact our industry.",Public
" On Wednesday, January 29, Commissioner Aaron Demerson of the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) presented DynCorp International (DI) the “We Hire Vets” award in recognition for its commitment to hiring veterans. The “We Hire Vets” employer recognition program, a partnership between the TWC, Texas Veterans Commission (TVC) and Texas Workforce Solutions, was launched in 2017 to recognize Texas employers for their commitment to hiring veterans and to provide Texas workers who are veterans with a direct link to employment opportunities. Texas is home to more than 565,000 employers and 2.6 million small businesses, and there are 1.7 million veterans in Texas. The program allows employers to apply for the recognition or be nominated by a local workforce development board or TVC partner. “I am excited to celebrate DynCorp International for their efforts in hiring our nation’s heroes,” said TWC Commissioner Representing Employers Aaron Demerson. “With 42 percent of its Texas workforce made up of veterans, DynCorp is ensuring our veterans have the opportunity to experience the same pride and purpose they had while serving.” “The Texas Veterans Commission recognizes companies for focusing on veteran employment,” said Thomas Palladino, TVC executive director. “Because hiring veterans is not good will, it’s good for business.” DI’s Dianne Walker, Human Resources senior vice president and Fred Littleton, Recruiting director received the award on behalf of DI. “Approximately 60 percent of our global workforce are veterans,” said Dianne Walker. “DI has a proud and longstanding legacy of hiring veteran employees.” “In 2019 we hired 483 employees in Texas, more than half of which were veterans,” said Fred Littleton. “Not only do vets bring the skills needed to perform our job requirements, they also help build up our company with values, honor and a mindset of service.”",Public
" In April 2019, a DynCorp International (DI) team from the Patuxent River Naval Air Station program traveled to Ingalls Field in Hot Springs, Virginia, to test the Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasure (DAIRCM) system in AH-1Z and MH-60S aircraft. The objective of the detachment was to evaluate the DAIRCM, an improved missile countermeasure system, to determine if the system’s performance was ready for the next phase of testing and fielding. In addition to DI maintenance, the detachment team consisted of about 30 people from NAVAIR, Atlantic Test Range and the Center for Countermeasures, among others. Ingalls Field is an excellent airfield to test with very little traffic on the tip-top of a mountain with terrain sharply dropping off into valleys to the east and west. A challenge that comes with testing on the top of a mountain where field elevation is 3,790 feet, however, is the weather. During the April detachment, the weather varied from 75 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny to driving rain and dense fog with temps barely climbing out of the 40’s. Of course, the day when the MH-60 was due for a full round of torque checks the team was battling heavy rain and visibility down to 100 feet. Although major maintenance was completed on the aircraft prior to detachment, subsequent torque checks on every fastener and driveshaft coupling from the main transmission to the intermediate gearbox were required. This covers a lot of bolts, most of which are very difficult to access, requiring the DI maintainers to contort on top and sometimes inside the aircraft. “Maintenance like this is no small task in the dry hangar back home at Patuxent River,” said Charlie Grogan, DynAviation Navy lead. “Yet our maintenance team executed on the flight line, on the top of a mountain, in the driving elements.” While the rest of the detachment planned the next flight events or analyzed data from the comforts of the hotel, the DI team worked for a full day in the driving rain. Through dedication, skill and resolve, the team got the job done and returned the aircraft to an up status for test execution the next day. The weather cleared, the MH-60 flew, and the detachment team was able to successfully collect and deliver the needed data to bring a more capable system to the fleet. “The magnitude of the work performed by the DI maintenance personnel in the elements and the attitude with which they met their task stands out as a highlight of our time on the mountain,” said a U.S. Navy lieutenant from the detachment.",Public

" Navigating the various permissions and licenses to operate in a foreign country can be daunting. DynCorp International’s Afghanistan Operations team is a group of eleven employees that support almost all our programs in Afghanistan. Their special support ranges across many different areas including Security, Personal Security Transport (PST), Tax, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan (MoFA), Administration, and Visa/Liaison support. Much of their work allows the programs in Afghanistan to meet the rule of Afghan law and to ensure that the laws and rules are applied properly and correctly. These team members interact with the various Afghan ministries, ensuring visas and MoFA reference numbers are delivered and processed on time and that comprehensive tax situations are dealt with accurately and correctly. Additionally, the team, led by security director Glen Lewis, ensures that whenever there is an incident, timely and accurate information is disseminated across all channels and levels of DynCorp International. One of the most important challenges this team faces is renewing the Services International LLC/Risk Management Company (SIL/RMC) license each year. Without the license or a letter bridging to the next license, a company can no longer provide RMC services to its customers – in short, the company cannot conduct certain types of business in Afghanistan. Mr. Zubair Wahabzai, the Visa/Government Liaison specialist, took on this difficult challenge even after the Ministry of Interior Counterterrorism Department (MoICT) insisted it would not be willing to give any type of bridging letters to any RMC companies in Afghanistan. After multiple trips around the city of Kabul, including daily trips to the MoICT Department to meet with very senior leaders, his constant engagement, coupled with a lot of finesse, resulted in DynCorp International receiving the very first, highly sought-after bridging letter.",Public

" On the Naval Test Wing Pacific (NTWP) program at Point Mugu, California, DynCorp International (DI) employee Wilfredo “Willie” Dumaop performed his routine foreign object debris (FOD) sweep of Bloodhound 303 of the U.S. Navy Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 30 (VX-30). “It was just another routine FOD sweep,” said Willie, DI Quality Assurance (QA) representative. “Then I noticed something hidden behind the pilot’s rudder pedals.” Mr. Dumaop discovered a critical piece of foreign debris, a Stratus inverter power plug, behind the pedals. “Without his diligent efforts and attention to detail, this piece of equipment could have easily fouled vital safety of flight controls resulting in significant damage or even loss of life,” said the U.S. Navy VX-30 Maintenance Officer. “Mr. Dumaop found this missing piece of equipment even before the aircrew or duty officer were able to communicate the potential of hard FOD being adrift in the cockpit or even on the aircraft.” “Willie Dumaop displayed an exemplary commitment to the ideals of safe and effective maintenance, which are the foundation of Naval Aviation,” continued the maintenance officer. “His actions display an example for all to emulate.” For his achievements to improving safety, Mr. Dumaop received a VX-30 Safety Professional award. “I’m proud of Willie for his commitment to safety and his attention to detail, and would like to congratulate him for this most deserved award,” said Bob Sanford, Point Mugu assistant site manager and QA director.

" The DynCorp International (DI) teams may have had more fun playing tournaments with their mini-golf greens than constructing them! The results are in from July’s DynFun activity, a miniature golf course construction contest. Teams worked inventively to build an individual putt-putt hole to incorporate into a DI-wide virtual golf course spread throughout the globe. The team on LOGCAP’s NTC program in Fort Irwin, California, built a putt-putt hole symbolizing their base in the desert. It included course features representative of many elements of their location: the historical Painted Rocks near the main gate, the High Mobility, Multi-Purpose, Wheeled Vehicle that DI maintains, the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier that DI also maintains, the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter to represent the DI Air Traffic Controllers, orange cones to represent the Vehicle Issue Yard and Rotational Unit Field Maintenance Area where vehicles are transferred to/from DI for test, repair & inspection, the ammunition can representing the Theatre Ammunition Supply Point, the brake rotor and exhaust pipe to represent other maintenance facilities, and finally, the cactus, donkeys and coyotes to represent the desert. The Accounts Payable team in Fort Worth, Texas went with a tropical luau party theme, featuring pool noodle guides, a tiki windmill, a metal filing rack tunnel, a pool float trap and a hibiscus flower ramp. They had an honor system on scorecards emphasizing fair play for their tournament prize. Alliance Security and Facilities in Fort Worth, Texas set up a Team dysFUNctional hole featuring an Edward Snowden and Leonard Moss starting tee with vintage cartoon burglars and insider threat ‘shadow man’ tube obstacles, with the finish in a DI Mailroom mailbox. At the McLean, Virginia office, team Corporate Security, Facilities & Real Estate created a carnival-game type putt-putt green with three alternative scoring options, the ultimate goal score being Security Superstar! They played the DI Security Open Mini Golf Tournament, which resulted in a four-way tie.

" On DynCorp International’s (DI) CLS-Transport program at Redstone Army Airfield in Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, three DI mechanics worked under the close observation of technical writers, Beechcraft engineers and Fixed Wing Project Office observers to execute the first successful Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) modification of a T-6D aircraft. ADS-B is a next generation surveillance technology which introduces air and ground aspects that provide Air Traffic Control with an accurate picture of the aircraft’s three-dimensional position in the en-route, terminal, approach and surface environments. “Allen Girod, John Wiley and Tyler Dowland were recognized by LTC Cornelius Allen, Commander of the Aviation Flight Test Directorate for their outstanding performance,” said Kirk McCauley, CLS-Transport program director. The employees conducted the modification using red-lined procedures for the T-6B aircraft, supporting the U.S. Army’s Validation and Verification (V&V) effort. V&V is a process for system engineers to gauge progress and use quality controls to verify all requirements are met on analysis testing, inspection and demonstration requirements. Even with the mandatory requirement for DCMA quality assurance stop-points, the DI team completed the modification ahead of schedule in only 200 hours, versus the anticipated 349 hours. “The DI maintenance team was able to surpass all customer expectations and successfully execute the ADS-B out modification in record time,” continued Kirk. “In light of their performance, the DI team was formally recognized and awarded commander’s coins for excellence by the Redstone Test Center customer.” The CLS-Transport program provides all logistics and maintenance support for 151 aircraft dispersed among 72 sites worldwide. The program’s four assigned T-6D “Texan” aircraft support the U.S. Army’s flight test activity and are maintained by DI employees at Redstone Army Airfield, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.",Public

" DynCorp International (DI) hosted students from the National Defense University (NDU) at the McLean, Virginia office on Friday, April 12. The students are part of the National Defense University’s competitive Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy. The nearly year-long curriculum prepares select military officers and civilians for leadership roles and success in developing national security strategy. Graduates are taught skills that can be used to better evaluate, marshal, and manage resources in the execution of military strategies. Many graduates of the program go on to hold leadership positions throughout the government and become executives in industry. Topics varied from an overview of what DI does, to specific program details, to finance. One area of concentration was DynCorp International’s ability to stand up high-performing, rapid response teams that offer unique, tailored solutions. For example, there were questions about how DI approaches complex tasks like responding to natural disasters when resources can be scarce and needs are ever-changing. The group was also interested in learning how DI successfully implements large scale programs quickly while maintaining our high-quality standards and our companies’ core values. The seventeen scholars represented a diverse group with a wide array of experience and included members of U.S. Armed Forces, select inter-agency civilians, and representatives from Tanzania, Croatia, Italy, and Bosnia and Herzegovina armed forces. Attendees hold ranks in the military including Commanders, Lieutenants, Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels.

" Carol Simmons said, “It’s time.” After serving 43 years with DynCorp International (DI), Carol is looking forward to spending time with her children and grandchildren in Arizona. She began work for Dynalectron, DI’s predecessor, in 1976 as an aircraft mechanic at Wichita Air Force Base in Kansas. She left Wichita to accept a short assignment to Charleston AFB and in 1978 transferred to George AFB in California supporting F-4 aircraft maintenance until 1991. “Yes, that is correct – Carol started as an aircraft mechanic back in ’76,” said Charlie Grogan, current U.S. Navy senior program director and previous Contract Field Teams lead. “She was definitely a pioneer in her field.”  In 1991 Carol transferred to Germany and served as an aircraft mechanic, inspector and supervisor at progressively higher levels. In 2008 after 17 years in Germany, she transferred to Fort Worth, Texas as the administrative manager for the U.S. Air Force Contract Field Team (CFT) program. Carol took that job into the field in 2017 at Davis-Monthan AFB in Arizona, where she also added an administrative role on the A-10 aircraft task order. “Although she supported many DI contracts, from the start to the finish of her career she was assigned to the CFT contract,” continued Charlie. “Another interesting note – CFT is DI’s longest running contract. It’s been an IDIQ task order contract continuously from 1951 to today.” Dianne Walker, SVP Human Resources, has known Carol for more than 40 years. She said, “Along the way, without intent, Carol served as a role model for social change. She paved the way for female employees to thrive in an industry whose work force was, historically, composed of male counterparts.” “Carol was successful in her many early assignments as aircraft mechanic, electronics technician, supply technician, aircraft inspector, NDI level III inspector and as a supervisor/manager responsible for directing the efforts of assigned personnel that provide maintenance, modification and repair of rotor-winged aircraft and major weapons systems,” added Dianne. “It has been my pleasure to have had the opportunity to work with Carol these past many years. While we executed DI’s mission many miles apart from one another, it was always apparent Carol operated with ethics and integrity, led by example, and succeeded in keeping our workforce motivated and mission focused even during the most challenging of circumstances. Her actions while with DI have earned my respect, and she has been and remains an inspiration to us all and a role model worthy of emulation!”   Carol received
an engraved crystal globe in recognition of her service from the CFT Program
Management Office, a Waterford crystal frame from the CAO-HR team and a

" DynCorp International’s (DI) Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV) Total Package Fielding (TPF) teams received kudos for training conducted in Korea and the U.S. “We recently issued 47 Long-Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) vehicles to various U.S. installations in Korea,” said Rich Majarrez, MTV logistics analyst and team lead. “Our fielding team flew to Busan, South Korea to inspect the vehicles before they were staged and shipped out to the different fielding sites throughout Korea. We had seven members: Gary Nobles, Robert Greene, Tim Fox, Eric Sirois, Ernie Huntly, Darin Widrick and myself.” Training was conducted at Camp Carroll in Waegwan and at Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, where DI’s MTV instructors familiarized attendees on the M1148 Load Handling System. MTV team members also conducted the issuing and handoff of the equipment to U.S. Army units at those two camps and at Camp Casey in Dongducheon, South Korea. The U.S. Army Product Support Manager (PSM) thanked DI’s MTV team, stating, “Your dedication, excellent coordination and overall TPF performance is nothing short of superb.” “Your recent completion of the Korea fielding was totally outstanding, you maintained excellent communication not only with the fielding manager but more importantly the gaining command,” continued the PSM. “Your planning, coordination and execution ensured the timeliness of the fielding without any disruption to the warfighter training schedule. Job well done!” “There was also a lot of coordination prior to the Korea deployment,” added Majarrez. “The team performed excellently throughout the entire process.” Meanwhile, at the Oshkosh facility in Warren, Michigan, four MTV employees developed an Instructor Key Personnel Training (IKPT) course for the next generation of MTV vehicle platforms: Christopher Perry, Craig Howard, Prince Smalls and Kurt Gould. “They did an outstanding job developing training manuals, devices and aids at the request of the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive & Armaments Command (TACOM) and the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Oshkosh Defense,” said Nick Sass, MTV program manager. “Their competencies, focus and field experience has contributed to great information transfer for the U.S. soldiers in the field working with the MTV family of vehicles.” Sass continued, “The future IKPT will continue to strengthen and build the bond and information flow between the TACOM office, the OEM, our DI teams and the soldiers we all support.”",Public

"  Last month in Kabul, Afghanistan, the Regional Security Office (RSO) Kabul and NATO’s Resolute Support Mission (RSM) in Afghanistan Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC) and the U.S. Embassy Kabul collaborated in a joint exercise designed to help save lives and mitigate property damage by conducting a fire and emergency support services mass casualty (MASCAL) exercise.  The RSM headquarters is host to military personnel from numerous allied and partner nations and includes a fire department and medical facility. The RSM fire and medical teams are capable organizations managed by a European contractor, and they were the U.S. Embassy’s primary fire response prior to the U.S. Embassy contracting with DynCorp International (DI) to provide fire and emergency services on the Afghanistan Life Support Services (ALiSS) contract.  “Both Resolute Support Mission and the U.S. Embassy wanted to identify gaps and/or shortfalls in the emergency response plan and prepare for future incidents at either location,” said Ken Fox, ALiSS vice president. “DI’s fire team at the U.S. Embassy joined forces with the RSM fire and medical departments to conduct drills in fire attack, search and rescue, patient transport, triage, and coordinated communications so we get experience working together and can identify areas for improvement.”  The BDOC commander complimented both departments on the MASCAL exercise process by stating, “I would never think that this was the first time the fire departments have worked together, the drill responses were so seamless. The fire departments and medical teams both demonstrated commendable action and sense of urgency.”  During the training, the DI fire team responded via fire engine to the RSM compound, deployed hose lines, made entry into the area and extinguished a simulated fire. The team then rescued three ‘personnel’ and triaged with DI and RSM medics to place them in ambulances for transport to the MASCAL center. The fire team then assisted with secondary search drills. Ventilation, salvage and overhaul were conducted prior to terminating the exercise so the fire engine is re-serviced and response ready.  “The drill and efforts by all who participated was recognized as a success by both the U.S. Embassy and NATO’s Resolute Support Mission,” added Ken Fox. “I’d like to thank the DI team for their hard work and dedication to make our community at the U.S. Embassy and Resolute Support – NATO headquarters a safer place to live.”",Public
" Three service milestones were reached recently at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland on DynCorp International’s (DI) program servicing aircraft for the U.S. Navy. Celebrating 40 years of service were Steve Long and Walter Muenzel, and celebrating 45 years of service was Ethrage “Duck” Haggard. “DI has
serviced the U.S. Navy at Pax River continuously since 1973,” said Randy
Hughes, program manager. “Steve, Walter and Duck have played a significant role
in DI’s continued success at Pax. They have contributed to our long legacy of
providing unmatched dedicated service to our navy customer and are standout
examples of serving today for a better tomorrow with a combined 29,200 days of
service!”    Steve Long began his career at Dynalectron, DI’s predecessor company, in 1979 at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (TPS) at NAS Patuxent River. Steve started out maintaining T-2 aircraft and has since worked on A-4, U-6, NU-1B, X-26 and T-38 aircraft. Steve is currently the subject matter expert on the NU-1B and U-6 aircraft and has been very influential in training the next generation of aircraft mechanics as they support the school’s unique national assets. Steve holds an FAA Airframe and Power Plant (A&P) license and has received multiple letters of appreciation for his work to include one from the Naval Air Test and Evaluation Museum at Pax River and another from the commander of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School while serving his 40-year tenure at TPS. Walter “Frank” Muenzel began his career at Dynalectron in 1979 at the U.S. Navy TPS as an aircraft mechanic after serving four years in the United States Marine Corps (USMC). While in the marines, Frank worked on F-4J aircraft and reached the rank of corporal. Early in the 1980’s Frank transferred to the ground support equipment shop where he maintains many different types of aviation support equipment for TPS. The Naval Air Test and Evaluation Museum at Pax River commended him in a letter of appreciation while serving his 40-year tenure at TPS. Frank’s family has a history of service to the nation – he was born in Germany where his father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force and his brother is retired from the USMC. Married to his wife Evelyn for more than 20 years, he has two daughters and a son. Ethrage “Duck” Haggard holds the distinction of having the longest current continued service within the company, having reached the 45-year milestone of DI service. Duck started his employment as a Contract Field Team aircraft mechanic on March 4, 1974 at Shaw AFB, South Carolina, and performed aircraft maintenance services at Honolulu, Hawaii, and Elmendorf, Alaska before taking a position at Patuxent River in 1975. Many of the aircraft Duck has maintained at Pax River are currently retired and being honorably displayed at the Pax Naval Air Museum. Currently serving as the business manager on the Naval Test Wing Atlantic program, Duck enjoys spending time with his grandson fishing and hunting. “Congratulations and a big THANK YOU on behalf of a very appreciative company,” said Joe Ford, DynAviation president. “These three gentlemen have reached an epic and extraordinary milestone in their years of service.”",Public
" This October, the DynCorp International (DI) Total Package Fielding (TPF) Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV) team traveled from Fort Carson, Colorado and Fort Bragg, North Carolina to Guam to issue vehicles and teach an Operator New Equipment Training (OPNET) class for the U.S. Army 797th Engineer Company. “Despite a typhoon that hit the island and closed the base for a day, the OPNET class continued as scheduled and was instructed by DI’s Johnny Wolford, Robert Greene and Eric Sirois,” said Nick Sass, MTV program manager. “They received many accolades and high marks from the 797th from the post-training evaluations.”  The MTV team conducted a joint inventory of ten M1083A1P2 trucks consisting of both DI personnel and the 797th Company. Briefings were given on proper inventory procedures to ensure the unit understands their responsibility and tasks for inventories. The joint inventory was followed by the OPNET training class, hands-on vehicle familiarization instruction and a road test.  “I’m proud of the MTV team for generating yet another example of how DI satisfies our customers and delivers results,” added Sass.",Public
" Clifford Ruggles, program manager of DynCorp International’s (DI) Phoenix Consulting Group, recently traveled to Afghanistan to provide counter-elicitation training to DI’s Afghanistan National Army (ANA), Afghanistan National Police (ANP) and Afghanistan Life Support Services (ALiSS) programs in Kabul. A former U.S. Army interrogator and strategic debriefer who has been with the Phoenix Consulting Group since 2003, Mr. Ruggles focused his training primarily on teaching techniques for recognizing and countering information-gathering attempts by potential competitors, adversaries or anyone else seeking to gain insight into DI’s operations.  “Due to the fact that DI employees in Afghanistan routinely work alongside our competitors and interact daily with people from dozens of countries, the potential for unknowingly disseminating sensitive company information is high,” said Ruggles. ALiSS Food Service Operations Manager Robert Peters noted, “I thought that the class was very informative and should be a requirement. In contracting, especially overseas, there are numerous opportunities for employees to inadvertently pass along proprietary information. Being in a community such as this, most people are friendly with one another. What one person may think is a friendly conversation, another person may be trying to use the conversation to elicit or extract information that their company can use on proposals.” “It was an excellent class and Cliff Ruggles is an excellent instructor. You can tell that he has been doing it for a long time and it shows in his delivery, presentation, and his knowledge is off the charts,” commented Curtis Blasé, ANA/ANP director of Security and Operations. “Although the focus of these training events was primarily counter-elicitation, the Phoenix Consulting Group conducts a wide variety of training courses such as Advanced Crisis Negotiations, Business Intelligence, Strategic Debriefing of Law Enforcement Sources, Cognitive Interviewing, and others,” added Ruggles. Descriptions of these and other Phoenix course offerings can be found in their online brochure.

" Flash flooding in Dallas-Fort Worth held off just long enough for eighteen holes to be played in the DynCorp International (DI) Journey of Hope Charity Golf Tournament on Friday, September 21. The tournament raised $143,000 for the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) with donations from tournament sponsorships and raffles.  Bonnie Carroll, president and founder of TAPS, joined DI and the players at the Fossil Creek Golf Course in Fort Worth, Texas for the tournament. “It was an honor to be the beneficiary of the DynCorp International Journey of Hope golf classic,” said TAPS founder Bonnie Carroll. “The day came off flawlessly and the weather was perfect – the rain held off until the very last golfer was on their last hole! We like to think our heroes in heaven were watching over us and kept the rain off those who are helping their loved ones!”  “We are so grateful to the entire DI family and thankful for the partnership we share to care for the families of our contractors who have lost a hero in service to our great nation,” added Bonnie.  The tournament, a four-person golf scramble, had a total of 25 teams participating for first, second and third place winner as well as women’s and men’s longest drives and closest to the pin competitions. The $10,000 hole-in-one contest winner unfortunately remained elusive. “The tournament was a terrific success and I was proud to assist with such a great cause,” said Joe Ford, president of DynAviation and DI’s master of ceremonies for the event. “The funds raised will directly support the surviving families of our military and contractors who have lost a hero.” “I’d like to thank all of the generous DI suppliers who helped sponsor the tournament and all the players who purchased raffle tickets and mulligans,” said Billy Harlin from DI’s Supply Chain. “Their contributions are going to a great charity, which performs a critical service to the family members of fallen military.” The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) is the national organization providing compassionate care for the families of America’s fallen military heroes. When a member of America’s armed forces dies, TAPS is on the front lines providing compassionate care to the families left behind. Since 1994, TAPS has assisted over 80,000 surviving family members, casualty officers and caregivers who are grieving the loss of a military loved one, regardless of the geography or the circumstances of their death. TAPS has supported many DI families since 2010, and in 2014, DI became the first private company to form an official partnership with TAPS to provide support to families of fallen DI personnel. Through this agreement, TAPS and DI’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP), designed to support DI employees and their families, work together to provide survivors of DI employees comfort and care through comprehensive services and programs including peer-based emotional support, case work assistance, connections to community-based care, and grief and trauma resources.

" DCA Live, an organization that covers the industries, companies and people that are driving growth in the Washington, D.C. region, recognized DynCorp International’s (DI) Virginia Robinson at its 4th Annual DCA Live Top Corporate Counsel event on September 17. In partnership with the Association of Corporate Counsel-National Capital Region, DCA Live recognized 40 of the most interesting and dynamic in-house attorneys in the Washington, D.C. region. Virginia Robinson, Chief Counsel for Labor & Employment and Environmental Health and Safety at DI, has been an attorney in the DI Legal Department for six years. Before working at DI, Virginia honed her skills at some of the top law firms in the country. She graduated from Penn State in 1999 with a B.A. in English and obtained her law degree in 2005 from the Washington & Lee University School of Law. In a brief interview with DCA Live, Virginia discussed her experiences working in-house for DynCorp International. DCA Live: Your 2018 summer vacation spot(s)? Virginia: Italy (Venice, Padua, Florence, Rome). DCA Live: Best part about being in-house? Virginia: Cultivating a deeper understanding of my client; ability to collaborate with colleagues and clients without billing pressures. DCA Live: Biggest in-house trends/issues your law firm friends and colleagues should know about? Virginia: It’s important to keep in mind that your corporate client’s goals and needs are not stagnant – they change over time, sometimes quite quickly, based on a wide variety of constantly shifting internal and external pressures. Make sure you ask your clients about the current issues they are facing that might influence your handling of an otherwise seemingly unrelated matter. DCA Live: Your advice to a soon to graduate law school student? Virginia: Law firm jobs can be an important way to learn strong customer service skills, so starting your career in private practice can be a good idea, but keep an eye out for in-house opportunities before you get too senior in your career – you will find the work both challenging and rewarding.",Public
" The U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River in Maryland has completed installation and testing of the Area Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) modification in two T-6B Texas II aircraft. “This is a major modification to the aircraft, and the install training was provided by our DynCorp International (DI) folks at Whiting Field when Pax sent a team down to Florida,” said Randy Hughes, Pax River program manager. “Our DI technicians did an outstanding job installing this mod on the first two aircraft and we have four others to complete.” “The Navy at Pax decided to have our DI team here do the installation, instead of sending this out to have completed,” continued Hughes. “Needless to say, this has saved the Test Pilot School countless dollars and potential loss of aircraft for an extended period of time by having the Pax DI team do this mod on site.” The ADS-B system is a surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines its position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcasts it, enabling it to be tracked by air traffic control. The information is received by ATC ground stations as a replacement for secondary surveillance radar, as no interrogation signal is needed from the ground. ADS-B is an element of the United States Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), required by January 2020, for all aircraft operating in airspace where transponders are required now. The team effort involving Textron Defense Systems, Naval Undergraduate Flight Training Systems program office (PMA-273) and DynCorp International technicians took nearly 300 man-hours and involved significant modifications to aircraft wiring and avionics components.",Public

" This April, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul was recognized as a worldwide winner of the Greening Council’s Greening Diplomacy Initiative (GDI) Award for their recycling efforts in a critical-threat environment. DynCorp International currently provides waste management services under a task order on the Afghanistan Life Support Services (ALiSS) program, and has been leading the recycling efforts at the embassy. The annual GDI Awards recognize posts or offices that innovate to reduce their environmental footprint. This award was presented to Embassy Kabul for remaining committed to reducing their environmental footprint despite facing a constant critical-threat security environment with limited infrastructure. The embassy’s recycling program recycled 364,000 pounds of waste in 2017. Local partners turned the recycled materials into items such as plastic furniture, toilet paper, and dishes. This partnership expands private sector-led economic growth and provides employment alternatives to those at risk of radicalization and violent extremist messaging. The post also launched a campaign to discourage the use of bottled water, emphasizing that 100% of compound water is potable. Post’s Green Team and the ALiSS program issued water bottles and filters to 200 embassy personnel to help reduce bottled water usage. About Greening Diplomacy Initiative The Greening Diplomacy Initiative (GDI) was launched on April 22, 2009, to capture and disseminate grassroots sustainability efforts at the U.S. Department of State. GDI is the umbrella term for actions undertaken by personnel, posts, offices, and bureaus to improve the environmental performance and sustainability of the Department of State’s world-wide facilities and operations. GDI is support by the Eco-Diplomacy Unit within the Innovation Directorate, which works to strengthen and disseminate tools and policies aimed at increasing operational efficiencies that reduce the Department’s environmental footprint and operational costs.

" Recently, DynCorp International (DI) CEO George Krivo spent a day visiting the CAL FIRE program in McClellan, California. “Mr. Krivo wanted to see the DI maintenance technicians who maintain the CAL FIRE fleet of aircraft. We also showed him the completed Project X aircraft, pre-paint, which will be Tanker 79 this summer. The aircraft was rescued from the Navy boneyard, stripped down to the bare metal, and modified with over 300 kits installed – including new wire harnesses, new turbine engines and a retardant tank addition to the center fuselage,” said Jeff Cavarra, CAL FIRE director. “We greatly appreciate him taking the time to come out and tour our operation.” While on site, George held an informal all-hands meeting to talk about relevant company information and answer questions. The program has been busy conducting ground and flight school training while maintenance technicians perform annual maintenance on all three CAL FIRE aircraft types – S-2, OV-10 and UH-1H. “The CAL FIRE program is a complex and extraordinary effort,” said CEO George Krivo. “There are more aircraft than I was expecting – it is truly impressive. They are doing outstanding and important work, maintaining these aircraft and executing critical lifesaving operations.”",Public
" In the words of author Stephen King, “Sooner or later, everything old is new again.” On January 25, Tanker 79 made its maiden flight after 22 months of work by DynCorp International (DI) mechanics on the CAL FIRE program in Sacramento, California. The aircraft flew for the first time since 1977, when it was retired by the U.S. Navy. DI opened the first Work Order on the aircraft in March of 2016.  “The project, dubbed Project X during the conceptual phase, took the aircraft to a barebones airframe and rebuilt it from there,” said Jeff Cavarra, CAL FIRE program director.“DI employees performed all of the work on the aircraft and were assisted by various other vendors who provided engineering and logistical support, and specialized services.”  The rebuilt aircraft included new wiring, structural improvements and modifications, removal of the torpedo bay, installation of the retardant tank, a refurbished hydraulic system, installation of a stand-alone retardant tank hydraulic operating system, modified and overhaul cockpit layout and features, and a new fuel system. It will be available for the 2018 fire season in California and is expected to be based in Hollister, California. The FAA DER flight test pilot who performed the first flight stated, “It was the most uneventful first flight that I ever remember having.” The aircraft will be flown for approximately 40-50 additional hours prior to being flown to Arizona for paint. “The success of Project X is a testament to the partnership that DI has with CAL FIRE,” continued Cavarra. “What an amazing accomplishment for these employees and an extraordinary story for DI.”",Public
" Just last year, DynCorp International’s (DI) Global IT Modernization (GITM) program partnered with a U.S. Embassy overseas and completed the first fully-remote installation of the Enterprise Converged Platform (ECP). ECP is the Department of State’s Bureau of Information Resource Management’s (IRM) new virtualized core IT infrastructure solution for overseas embassies and consulates. ECP is comprised of core infrastructure components (servers, storage, and switches) that are converged into a single, cohesive product, which is engineered, manufactured and supported by the vendor. The ECP will replace existing core IT infrastructure in a scalable half-rack system. Embassy staff from the first fully remote install described the upgrade experience as “stellar” and thanked the team for their hard work in making the installation a success. GITM plans to continue to deploy hundreds of ECPs in the near future. This pace requires a majority of these installs to be fully remote in order to keep on schedule, saving the Department of State millions of dollars in travel funding and labor resources in the process. GITM program manager Josh Creson said, “Our onsite installations began in June 2016, with a total of 160 installations in more than 100 countries being completed by the end of December 2017. Our program’s supply chain management and deployment operations staff have worked collaboratively with one another and our partner engineering offices, vendors and embassy staff around the world to make the deployments of this new technology a great success for the Department of State.” Because of DI-GITM’s success with this streamlined installation approach, proving significant cost-avoidance while accelerating the hardware refresh schedule, IRM plans to follow this remote installation approach with as many ECP installations as possible in 2018. “We already completed 105 fully remote installations, which has resulted in over $1M of travel-associated cost avoidance for the Department of State. None of this would be possible if it wasn’t for our talented and dedicated team of IT professionals,” said Creson. A major goal of the Vanguard 2.2.3-GITM contract vehicle is implementing innovations and efficiencies by leveraging technology to increase the pace of hardware and software deployments and maximizing the lifespan of core infrastructure. DI’s accomplishments toward this goal began in December 2014, shortly after standing up the program. The DI-GITM team performed “remote retrofit” installations of post local area network (LAN) software, implementing a new software baseline. This work was similar in nature to performing core installations but was performed remotely instead of having installers on site. Taking an innovative approach to increase productivity, DI re-engineered the remote retrofit installation process using a modular approach that was well received by GITM management and overseas posts. This improvement helped the DI-GITM team to not only become more efficient and accelerate IT modernization schedules but paved the way for the development of the new modular approach used to deploy ECPs remotely. Staying focused and motivated to maintain momentum toward implementing even greater efficiencies, the deputy program manager Sean Crowley and the DI-GITM Data Services team, in partnership with DI’s corporate IT office led by Lijun Jiang and Annie Wisniewski, launched the development of the Deployment Management System (DMS) in April 2016. “This system is proprietary and unique to DI’s data services, enhancing scheduling, project management, workflow execution of global IT modernization projects and dashboard reporting for senior IRM leadership. Our team received glowing reviews from our customer for our project dashboard, activity tracking and shipping log capability and we owe a big thank you to Annie, Lijun, Colin, Ivar and Zaynabb for their hard work,” said Sean Crowley.  ",Public
" After Hurricane Maria left a path of devastation that destroyed Puerto Rico’s power grid and most infrastructure, Title 10 forces such as DoD, FEMA, National Guard and first responders quickly reacted to facilitate aid efforts. However, they had no place to stay. On October 4, DynCorp International’s (DI) LOGCAP IV team joined recovery operations by immediately deploying to provide base camp operations and services for those estimated 4,500 Title 10 forces. The contract change order, valued at approximately $76 million for 90 days of service, plays a critical role in recovery operations through the construction, oversight, and management of all facets of the base camps.  “With DI’s renowned capabilities, the team was quick to respond,” said Rob Tillery, LOGCAP IV vice president. “Within 72 hours of receiving the notice to proceed, LOGCAP IV began mobilizing resources out of Jacksonville, Florida to the port of San Juan for the immediate establishment of base camp support.” Working within the logistical confines of hurricane destruction (to date, only 1,507 miles of Puerto Rico’s 5,073 miles of roads are open), LG4 began immediate construction of the Army North Joint Forces Land Component Command (JFLCC) at Aguadilla, located on the west coast of Puerto Rico island. “Because of the unparalleled efforts of on-site management teams supported by the full team at Alliance, the 1000 bed camp at Aguadilla was fully operational by October 18, just two weeks after the proceed notice,” said Tillery. Roosevelt Roads, a 1,500-bed camp located at the former naval air station on the east coast of the island, followed shortly thereafter and became fully operational on October 25. The Title 10 forces have begun to redeploy and the U.S. government has given direction to begin disassembly of the base camps, with complete removal to be completed by December 31, 2017. However, LOGCAP isn’t finished in Puerto Rico. Starting December 1 and lasting five months, LG4 is providing management, labor, material, equipment, supplies and logistics support to the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers and Task Force Power, tasked with supporting the material requirements of the two electrical contractors chosen to rebuild the power grid in Puerto Rico. “Restoring the power grid is a monumental undertaking spanning thousands of miles of towers, poles and electrical transmission and distribution lines and involves critical material management and logistic capabilities,” continued Tillery. “We are looking forward to the challenge to support this critical effort.” Warehouse support provided by LOGCAP replaced the logistics capabilities of Title 10 forces supporting the Corp of Engineers as the units redeployed from Puerto Rico.

" DynCorp International (DI) employees at the Alliance campus in Fort Worth, Texas raised $3085 in a charity raffle for Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) and the Wounded Warrior Project, and DI Corporate matched the amount raised, for a total of $6170. The winner received four roundtrip U.S. domestic airline ticket vouchers. The drawing was held at the Alliance holiday party for employees at the Texas Motor Speedway Club on Friday, December 1. “We wanted to support a great cause and foster an opportunity to give back while we celebrated a good year at DI,” said Jennifer Gallegos-Grumbles, senior security manager and holiday planning committee member. TAPS has supported many DI families since 2010, and DI is the first private company to form an official partnership with TAPS to provide support to families of fallen DI personnel. The Wounded Warrior Project offers a variety of programs, services and events for wounded veterans and active duty service members.

" In October, DynCorp International (DI) personnel from the corporate offices in McLean, Virginia, Fort Worth, Texas and Huntsville, Alabama raised $3045 dollars with a Blue Jeans for Breast Cancer (BJBC) fundraiser to support the Susan G. Komen 3-Day, a 60-mile walk to raise money in the fight against breast cancer. Two teams also participated in their local walks, one from DI’s INL Patrick Support Division in Melbourne, Florida, and another from DI’s Alliance facility in Fort Worth, Texas. “The PSD team participated in the Brevard County Florida Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk on Saturday, 28 October,” said Jerry Gandy, DI security manager. “The team, led by co-captains Gena Daignault and Kimberly Ashley, consisted of DI employees, family members and friends. The team surpassed their goal, earning a total of $3459 in support of the local American Cancer Society chapter. Way to go team DI Pink Warriors!” “My team as a whole, No Walker Left Behind, raised $53,775 dollars with 24 members, several of them DI employees, friends and family,” said Jessica Davis, proposal manager. “This was our tenth year to walk in the grueling Dallas/Fort Worth SGK 3-Day, and we had the full range of Texas weather. Friday was wet with a cold front, and temps for the other two days ranged from 60 degrees Fahrenheit to a balmy 93, making the 60 mile walk one of the hottest in the last ten years.”  “It was a life-changing weekend of emotion and memories and I encourage anyone to give it a try,” continued Davis. “The results from a 3-Day walk go directly to local communities for research and development; grants for mammograms and breast health; stipends to cancer patients to help bridge the gaps in finances; and clinical trials to discover medical advances towards finding a cure.”",Public

" During the recent spate of Northern California fires, DynCorp International (DI) pilots on the state of California’s aerial firefighting program flew 700 hours in seven days, from October 9 through October 15, 2017. “Our pilots have to ramp up extraordinarily quickly,” said Jeff Cavarra, DI’s program director for CAL FIRE. “On October 9th alone, 149 flight hours were reached in less than a 24-hour period. To perform in such a professional manner after having a relatively quiet period prior to the firestorm really showcases the skill and ability of our pilots.” CAL FIRE as an agency, including state-owned air tankers and contracted air tankers, pumped 3,600,000 gallons of fire retardant in a two-week period. One DI pilot even made 21 drops on a fire in one seven-hour period, operating the aircraft in single-pilot configuration (which is much more demanding than dual-crewed). In addition to the flight hours and millions of gallons of retardant, CAL FIRE maintenance technicians kept the aircraft running. In a typical ‘fire bust,’ one or two air attack bases become the focal point, with many aircraft making trips to and from the fire. The recent wildfires engendered a different scenario. There were at least five air attack bases operating with numerous aircraft. The maintenance technicians were putting in long hours at all of these bases to make certain the aircraft were safe to fly. DI’s CAL FIRE crew at McClellan AFB supported the bases with additional mechanics and aircraft parts. “We dispatched several mechanics into the areas where fires were actively burning, like Santa Rosa and Chico,” said Jeff Cavarra. “We had to check if roads were open to allow them to get to the bases. These mechanics went to the bases knowing they may have to sleep on the floor as all of the local lodging was filled by evacuees.” “As usual, I am honored to call these people co-workers,” continued Jeff. “They performed flawlessly in spite of the overwhelming odds they faced from Mother Nature.”",Public
" On November 12, the U.S. Army and DynCorp International signed a partnership agreement as part of the U.S. Army Partnership for Youth Success (PaYS) program. PaYS partners the Army with a cross-section of private industry, academia and state and local public institutes. The program guarantees Soldiers a job interview and possible employment after their service in the Army ends. This is a unique opportunity for America’s youth to serve their country and prepare for their own future. DynCorp International’s CEO George Krivo spoke at the ceremony and signed the agreement along with BG Kevin Vereen, Deputy Commanding General, USAREC. Following the signing ceremony, BG Vereen conducted an oath of enlistment ceremony for five new future soldiers. Remarks by George Krivo: “Men and women of the United States Army, friends and colleagues, and most importantly Future Soldiers… first and foremost, happy Veterans Day. I am truly honored to be here today representing DynCorp International at this important signing ceremony.  For those of you unfamiliar with DynCorp International, we have been a trusted partner to the Department of Defense and other government agencies for more than 70 years. Some of the services we provide include: aviation maintenance and operations, intelligence, logistics and contingency operations, ground vehicle operations and maintenance, and training. So it makes sense that more than 60 percent of our workforce are U.S. veterans, and that we are committed to continuing to employ veterans. In the last five years alone, DynCorp has hired approximately eight thousand veterans – with a large percentage coming from our United States Army. For our record of hiring vets, we are regularly recognized as being one of the top veteran-friendly companies in the United States. Our commitment to veterans isn’t just part of our culture though. The reality is that hiring veterans is good for business. Our customers depend on skills and leadership abilities that are unique to those who have worn the uniform. I myself served in the United States Army for more than 20 years. So while I have a deep respect for all Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen, you will understand why I hold the Army in particularly high regard. I’ve been where many of you are, at the cusp of shifting from civilian life to the military. I have also, many years later, transitioned back to civilian life. And I can’t overstate the value of the Army – both in terms of what you will do as Soldiers each and every day to prepare for your missions, and how the Army will prepare you for productive futures when your service concludes. That’s why I am so honored to be here today, to formally sign this partnership agreement that will guarantee Army Reserve, Active Duty Soldiers and ROTC cadets a job interview with companies just like DynCorp International when you choose to end your service. This is such an exciting program because it allows Soldiers to serve their country while planning for their futures. Returning to civilian life can be challenging for some. With PaYS, the Army is getting ahead of the curve and easing that transition well in advance. PaYS ensures that recruits know that opportunities are available to them later on. I said it earlier, but I will say it again – there are many, many opportunities best suited for veterans. DynCorp International relies on those who have served. When the time is right for you, companies like mine will be there, waiting for the opportunity to put your skills back to work in support of our great nation. We are honored for this opportunity to support our troops today. And in the future, when you are no longer wearing the uniform. Because as everyone in this room knows, Soldiers always answer the call to duty.Thank you.” Photos from the ceremony can be found on our Flickr album.",Public
" A delegation of DynCorp International (DI) leaders including Chief Executive Officer George Krivo, Senior Vice President for Business Development Joe Ford, AOLC Vice President Scott Rauer, DynLogistics Vice President Randy Bockenstedt and many others represented DI at the 2017 Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Annual Meeting and Expo in Washington, D.C., from October 9 through October 11. The annual event, held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, is the largest and most prestigious AUSA meeting and provided DI leaders the opportunity to meet with many of our most important customers in the U.S. Army and many other important stakeholders. “It was a great show,” said CEO George Krivo. “We were pleased to host senior Army leadership, key customers and business partners at our booth to discuss business opportunities.” Prominent engagements included: Congressman Joe Wilson; the Deputy Commander of the Army Material Command, Lieutenant General Edward Daly; the Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Lieutenant General Charles Hooper; the Commanding General of Army Contracting Command, Major General James Simpson; the Commanding General of Army Sustainment Command, Major General Duane Gamble; the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Program Support, Mr. Gary Motsek; and many others. “The team did a great job,” concluded SVP Joe Ford. “It’s a significant undertaking.

"  The USS Gerald R. Ford, the Navy’s newest and most sophisticated aircraft carrier, received and launched its first fixed-wing aircraft – and DynCorp International (DI) helped.  Eight DI employees from Naval Test Wing Atlantic Pax River, MD were aboard the USS Ford, tasked with aircraft maintenance support during Aircraft Compatibility Testing (ACT) and Precision Approach Landing Systems (PALS) testing of the F/A-18 Super Hornet. The DI detachment crew aboard the USS Ford, Kenneth Helmer Loy, James Eugene Bibb, Matthew Eric Hamilton, Brent William Harrison, Dillon Glen Looker, Jason James Ryals and Alexander Brady Welch, all received serialized commemorative coins for their participation in the test.  “It’s great to see the new technology mature from the testing phase to the application phase and become available for our warfighters,” said Darryl “Chris” Sexton, DI’s crew leader. “It was an honor to be part of this moment in history.” The catapult launches were conducted using the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and arrested landings were conducted using the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), aided by the Maritime Augmented Guidance with Integrated Controls for Carrier Approach and Recovery Precision Enabling Technologies (MAGIC CARPET) program for approaches and landings.  MAGIC CARPET is a collaboration by Naval Air Systems Command and the Office of Naval Research, and represents technology that simplifies the process of landing a fighter on an aircraft carrier. It allows pilots to make single-digit flight path corrections on final approach rather than hundreds – landing significantly closer to their target on the flight deck. Instead of worrying about adjusting roll, yaw and pitch, adding and reducing power, and predicting how the plane’s course will intersect with the moving ship’s course, MAGIC CARPET remaps the plane’s digital flight controls and enables the pilot to more directly and simply control flight path. Read about AAG, EMALs, and watch video of the launch in a Business Insider news article, here.  ",Public
" How long have you worked for current employer, or even your previous employer? It’s hard to surpass 35 years, which is the award given to a DynCorp International (DI) employee last month. Don Root, currently a Modification Work Orders (MWO) Road Team lead on the Regional Aviation Support Management – West (RASM-W) Army Field Maintenance (AFM) program at Fort Hood, Texas, received a service award last month for 35 years of employment with DynCorp International. In attendance was Dianne Walker, SVP HR, Billy “Bubba” White, AFM director, Merle Woosley, RASM-W AFM program manager, Shawn Dooley, AFM Fort Hood Operations manager, Marcus Rodriguez, AFM Fort Hood MWO manager and Keith Hanson, AFM Fort Hood site manager. “Don and I started with DI around the same time back when it was Dynalectron – Don at Fort Campbell and me at Fort Hood,” said Merle Woosley, RASM-W AFM program manager. “We finally met around 30 years later when he came to Texas as my deputy site manager and took over as site manager less than a year later. Don has worn several hats in support of RASM-W and is an outstanding professional in all he performs.” Don has served in more than 20 locations with DI in various capacities, including but not limited to program manager for the Kadena Contract Field Team (CFT) program in Japan, aircraft technician in Korea, many years at Fort Campbell in Kentucky, and positions in Germany, Saudi Arabia and Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan. Don is an avid participant in off-road buggy and boat building, and anything involving an over-powered vehicle and speed. “Don was always one of the veterans we admired in the business and was an inspiration for us to grow within the Company,” said Bubba White, AFM director. “In our many years of numerous evolutions of DynCorp International, Don Root has been an unwavering constant,” said Dianne Walker, HR senior vice president. “The continuous level of commitment and dedication that he has demonstrated in each of his leadership roles has helped contribute to the success the Company enjoys today. It has been my absolute pleasure to work with Don, and I look forward to working together in the years ahead.”",Public

" The Theater Aviation Sustainment Manager – OCONUS (TASM-O) program at Camp Bondsteel, Kosovo, recently experienced a microburst wind storm that damaged the aircraft hangar. The DynCorp International (DI) team was quick to respond to this dangerous situation and functioned as partners with the Army unit in Kosovo, assessing and mitigating the damage to the hangar, personnel, and the aircraft. “The team really pulled together to help,” said Bynum Harstin, DI’s Camp Bondsteel site lead. “It’s obvious they are appreciated – on July 1, Commander Muennich and staff presented team members with Certificates of Appreciation and a U.S. flag that had been flown over Camp Bondsteel in our honor.” The certificates thanked the team for their efforts and impact above and beyond the standard, not only in maintaining aircraft, but in all interactions with Task Force Aviation personnel; for providing exceptional aircraft maintenance and their dedication to the soldiers, NCOs and officers; and, for the accomplishments during the storm rotation, which were above the best. “We have a really great team in Kosovo and our other TASM-O sites,” said Bubba White, Army Field Maintenance Contract Field Teams (AFM/CFT) director. “They are truly dedicated in support of the mission.” On the TASM-O program, DI provides Army Aviation field and sustainment level maintenance services, including RESET restorative maintenance, throughout the TASM-O region to include worksites at Camp Humphreys, South Korea; Illesheim Army Airfield, Germany; Landstuhl Army Airfield, Germany; Wiesbaden Army Airfield, Germany; Hohenfels Army Airfield, Germany; Soto Cano Air Base, Honduras; North/South Camp, Sinai, Egypt; and Camp Bondsteel, Kosovo.",Public
" DynCorp International’s Patrick Support Division (PSD) at Patrick Air Force Base held a food drive in June to support their local food pantry, the South Brevard Sharing Center (SBSC) in Melbourne, Florida. The local sites collected food and cash donations, and overseas employees donated money online.

" On National Walking Day, April 5, DynCorp International (DI) teams competed against each other to win the title of Most Steps in a Day and to host the “Shoes” trophy for a year – an award won by the company after leading the American Heart Association’s 2016 Greater Washington Region Heart Walk. Each team logged steps for the day during a nine-hour period and took photos to share. Last year’s winner was the LOGCAP IV team with just over 60,000 steps, and this year every team vied to beat that number. The Communications department got some healthy competitive chatter going on between teams in the days leading up to the walk. “Tillery’s team is going down,” said Mark Mirelez, AELS BU lead. “Between T-6 Combs, VIPSAM and ERRC, I know we can stomp LOGCAP’s record and get that Shoe trophy.” “We’re gonna walk all over Logistics and AELS” said Scott Rauer, AOLC lead. “Our RASM, TASM and INL Air Wing teams will not accept defeat.” Dianne Walker, vice president HR chimed in, “Our HR Center of Excellence (COE) is clearing a prime spot on our display shelf for the Shoe trophy we expect to host very soon.” With everyone pushing for the win, it was a day of fierce competition. “Win or lose, the INL Air Wing team had a great time contributing,” said Joe Dunaway, Air Wing lead. “It was a lot of good fun for all, especially as we walked all over Bubba’s team at more than 413 thousand steps total from our locations around the world.” “AOLC put in a stunning performance at more than 234 thousand steps from RASM, TASM and AFM/CFT combined,” said Scott Rauer, AOLC lead. “That’s not including INL Air Wing’s insane count. We totaled 647K!” “Our team AELS Fighting Falcons secured an incredible count of more than 489 thousand steps,” said Mark Mirelez, AELS lead. “We had a blast and hopefully one of our awesome teams secured the ‘Shoes’ trophy.” “Oh, amateurs,” said Rob Tillery, LG4 lead. “With 17 teams walking at Kandahar Airfield, FOB Shorab, FOB Dwyer and Alliance, Texas, LOGCAP totaled more than 605 thousand steps.” DI had teams ranging from only one person who tracked their steps all day to teams of 36 with every 15-minute spot filled. Here are the results! “Looks like Corporate IT snuck in for a surprise win!” said CEO Lou Von Thaer. “What a fantastic triumph, and a truly amazing amount of participation around the globe – rain, snow, sleet or shine!” “It’s great to see us come together as a company and do something fun, healthy and interactive for everyone,” continued Lou. “I look forward to more healthy challenges throughout the year.” Communications will deliver the Shoes trophy to the winning team and take a victory picture.

" On the MD Helicopters’ Contractor Logistics Support (MD530 CLS) program at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, DynCorp International (DI) personnel observed and mentored an Afghan Air Force (AAF) team load two AMD530 light-attack helicopters into a C-130, a large military transport aircraft. “This is the first time in the program’s history that the Afghans conducted an AMD530 load-out,” said Noel Shorts, MD530 CLS program manager. The Afghan personnel are trainees of the MD530 CLS Maintainer Training program. In addition to maintaining the AAF fleet of AMD530 aircraft, DI trains Afghan Air Force personnel to empower them to become Airframe and Power Plant (A&P) level maintenance mechanics. As part of that training and transition effort, DI team members mentored the AAF personnel in loading and securing the AAF AMD530 helicopters onto an AAF C-130. “We simply observed and made minor recommendations as the Afghans took charge of the load-out procedure,” said MD530 CLS Director of Maintenance Clem Flatt. “The Afghans are extremely motivated and competent. We are very proud of the students’ progress in all facets of helicopter maintenance and operations.” MD530 CLS Maintenance Floor Lead James Hendrick was instrumental in mentoring the AAF maintenance team, advising the AAF mechanics as they ‘tore-down’ the two AMD530 aircraft for shipment on the C-130. James said, “I was able to step back and the Afghan team knew exactly what to do. They followed the maintenance manuals perfectly and took personal pride in doing the job correctly.” “Our program is very proud and honored to work with a tremendous group of Afghans,” said Dale Pacwa, MD530 CLS deputy program manager. “They truly want the best for their nation and that pride is displayed on a daily basis by their dedication and work ethic.”",Public

The average length of time that the employees have worked for DI is 7.5 years, the majority of that time having been spent on ANA/ANP and its predecessor programs in Afghanistan. On the ANA/ANP contracts, DI team members perform dedicated in-depth advising, mentoring, training and program support to assist the Afghan Ministries of Interior and Defense forces in assuming full responsibility of their own security and operational needs. “I am proud of the ANA/ANP team for reaching this amazing milestone,” said Randy Bockenstedt, DI’s Logistics Business Unit lead. “They should be congratulated on their tenacity of service.” ",Public

" It’s no secret that heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the United States. What is less known is that today’s youth make up the first American generation expected to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents. This is a troubling fact, but the good news is that the American Heart Association (AHA) is committed to reversing this trend by fighting heart disease and stroke. It does so, in part, through annual Heart Walks across the country. This is a cause I believe in. And it’s a fight we can win. That is why I am deeply gratified to serve as this year’s chair of the Greater Washington Heart Walk. To make sure we reach our goal of raising $2.5 million in Washington, I want to encourage other Washington-area companies and executives to get involved – whether that’s through serving on the Executive Committee, investing in this important event or sponsoring teams for the Walk. At my company, DynCorp International (DI), cardiovascular conditions account for our biggest health insurance costs and take a large human toll on the people we care for and depend upon. That’s true for most organizations, which should make involvement in the Heart Walk a natural choice for companies and their corporate responsibility programs. And chances are that companies will find other shared focuses with the AHA. At DI, where almost half of our workforce are veterans, supporting the U.S. military is a top priority. That’s true too for the AHA, through programs and alliances with veterans’ groups. Another goal of the AHA is to reverse the trend of childhood obesity. There are countless reasons to support this objective, but to name just one: doing so will improve the military’s recruiting efforts by fostering future generations of healthy individuals able to have the opportunity to serve. I am challenging my company to “get healthy” this year. The Greater Washington Heart Walk will be our starting point, not just by encouraging people to get more active, but by bringing additional awareness and education concerning heart disease to the attention of our team. At DI, we like to say “We serve today for a better tomorrow.” The work of the AHA is also aimed at securing a better tomorrow. Please consider supporting this important cause by forming a team and joining us on November 5th. Register today at www.GreaterWashingtonHeartWalk.org.

" The 238 employees on the INL Air Wing program at Patrick AFB in Melbourne, Florida weathered Hurricane Matthew while maintaining continuous SATCOM communications both locally and with the forward country teams during the 36 hour storm duration. “We had a great prep plan – the team really pulled through with implementation,” said Joe Dunaway, Air Wing program manager and BAT lead. “No forward missions were affected in any of our locations around the world and the Florida team survived unscathed. It was a win all around.” Hurricane Matthew hit the Melbourne area with maximum winds of 115 miles per hour and the hurricane eye less than 30 miles off the coast of Florida. The storm traveled up the Eastern U.S. coastline before dissipating into a tropical storm. Several Air Wing employees live on the Florida barrier islands, a mandatory evacuation area. All the Air Wing employees, whether they evacuated or remained, pulled through the storm and are safe and uninjured. “Damage to our facilities was minor considering the force of the storm,” continued Joe. “We were very lucky – had Matthew come on shore it would have been devastating, similar to that of Andrew in 1992.”  ",Public

" This past August, DynCorp International (DI) CEO Lou Von Thaer made a trip to northern California to visit the CAL FIRE program. Since 2001, DI has been honored to hold the contract with CAL FIRE to maintain the State of California’s rotary and fixed-wing firefighting aircraft. DI also provides the pilots for CAL FIRE’s S-2 Airtanker fleet, OV-10 Command and Control aircraft, and A-200CT King Air training aircraft. “The partnership between DynCorp International and CAL FIRE continues to provide a high level of expertise in both aerial firefighting and aviation maintenance,” said Chief Ken Pimlott, CAL FIRE director. “Aerial firefighting is a critical and complex endeavor and this seamless partnership helps execute our operations with a focus on safety.” In addition to meeting with customers, Von Thaer toured the CAL FIRE hangars and met with DI colleagues working on the program. From the transmission overhaul shop to the flight line, he was impressed with the professionalism and knowledge demonstrated by everyone involved. “I was particularly excited by DI’s efforts to support CAL FIRE’s ‘Project X’ where we are working to completely regenerate and modify a retired S-2 aircraft from the stripped-down airframe to a brand new airtanker,” said Von Thaer. “The skills demonstrated and expertise gained will be invaluable to DI as we work to expand our capabilities and offerings to multiple customers.” Von Thaer concluded his visit with a stop at the Grass Valley Air Attack Base and got to witness firsthand the launch, return and reloading of the airtankers and support OV-10s. “While I always appreciated CAL FIRE’s work, it is hard to grasp the complexity and precision required for the mission until you see it in person,” he said.

We did a quick Google search and the Khabar News Agency, or Khabar Online, appears to be an Iranian government news outlet and thus is most likely an Iranian attempt to discredit the governments of Yemen, UAE and/or Saudi Arabia.

She drew an airplane with hand imprints for wings, accompanied by the slogan, “Safety is in your hands.” “When viewing Kylie’s submission, knowing a four year old girl’s hands represent a safe passage – symbolizing the wings of an aircraft – definitely elicits an emotional response from me, and I hope it does for everyone,” said Neville. “Your safety and your coworker’s safety is truly in your hands. You and your teammates have to build the foundation and the culture that reflects your attitude, belief, and perception of safety.” DynAviation safety coins have been created from Kylie’s design. As a reward for her winning submission, Kylie was presented with an iPad, a plaque and a DynAviation safety coin. “I want to also thank the rest of the children who took the time to create and submit their wonderful pictures,” continued Neville. “We had a tie for second place between Bianca and Emma from Fort Hood, who will receive a gift certificate, plaque and safety coin.”",Public

" In addition to a record-setting year of wildfires, two of California’s aerial firefighting program employees have received a major tribute or award. Pilot Lynn Flock received a traditional dousing by firefighters when he taxied under their crossed water sprays after landing one of his final flights. Flock, 66, retires this year when the extended fire season ends. “That was a nice sign of respect,” Flock said. “He spent his entire life fighting fires,” said Mike Venable, a fellow CAL FIRE pilot. “The tribute was well deserved.” Flock became a U.S. Forest Service smoke jumper in 1968 after graduating from high school. He parachuted into deep woods to fight hard-to-reach blazes before hiking out. He served as an elite Army Ranger in Vietnam. After leaving the service, he earned a degree in wildlife management while working as a smoke jumper during summer breaks. He continued as a smoke jumper after graduating, and shifted from smoke jumping to flying in the early 1990s. He flew smoke jumpers to fires before shifting to lead planes, who circle above aerial tankers in fire zones and direct retardant drops. After retiring from the Forest Service at 57, Flock shifted to contract work with CAL FIRE. Another CAL FIRE employee, Merlin Knittel, received the Charles Taylor “Master Mechanic” Award from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This award is the most prestigious award the FAA issues to certified technicians who have exhibited professionalism, skill and aviation expertise for at least 50 years in the aircraft maintenance profession as master mechanics. “A career spanning 50 years of exemplary service is truly extraordinary,” said Jeff Cavarra, CAL FIRE program director. “And to win the Charles Taylor Award on top of that is the highest honor the FAA can bestow on a technician. We are very proud of Mr. Knittel.” On CAL FIRE, DI aircraft mechanics maintain CAL FIRE’s S-2T air tankers, OV-10 air tactical aircraft, UH-1H Super Hueys and Beechcraft King Airs. Most maintenance is performed at McClellan Park near Sacramento, California. During fire season, DI maintenance personnel and pilots are stationed at 12 air attack bases strategically located throughout California.

" This past December, the last wave of DynCorp International (DI) employees departed Camp Gibson in Kabul, Afghanistan and the camp was officially turned over to the Afghan Ministry of Interior (MOI). DI inhabited Camp Gibson for more than eight years, providing security, meals, and operations and maintenance (O&M) support for countless DI and non-DI residents. DI began building Camp Gibson in 2006 and officially moved in August 1, 2007 under the Afghan Police Program (APP) within the U.S. Civilian Police (CIVPOL) contract. At this time Camp Gibson was instead known as the “500 Man Camp.” The camp was later named Camp Gibson in memory of the late Gerald Gibson, a DI employee killed in action in 2004 in Afghanistan. In 2008, Camp Gibson was transferred from APP to the Afghanistan Civilian Advisor Support (ACAS) program. The facility served as a central hub to over 2000 DI police advisors and support personnel stationed at the various regional training centers supporting the work of the U.S. Department of State’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Bureau (INL). In 2011, the ACAS police training advisors were transferred to the U.S. Department of Defense’s Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police (ANA/ANP) programs under the Afghanistan Ministries of Interior (MOI) and Defense (MOD). The goal of this mission was to assist the Afghanistan MOI and MOD in training their forces to assume full responsibility for their own professional police and national army presence. Despite this transfer, DI still maintained Camp Gibson through the end of 2014, providing security and life and mission support services to INL. In 2015, the contract was transitioned again to Gibson Training Center Afghanistan (GTC-A) Security Bridge contract and Life and Mission Support (LMS) contract under INL, both of which were retained by DI. DI’s legacy of support to the State Department at Camp Gibson came to an end on Tuesday, December 15, 2015. DI created and maintained this camp over the years and it was known as one of the top installations in Afghanistan.

" Team DI (DynCorp International) raised a total of $2,250 for the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) by running in the Marine Corps Marathon (MCM/10K) in Washington, D.C. on October 25. This year was the 40th anniversary of the marathon and the third largest in its history, with more than 23 thousand runners. The team included DI’s Elaine Kinnee who was joined by Sasha Bradford and Patrick McEvoy, both survivors of a loved one lost in service with DynCorp International. The run was Sasha’s first full marathon while Elaine and Patrick both ran in the 10K event. “I decided to run my first full marathon in memory of my late husband Michael,” said Sasha Bradford. “At mile 19 when I wanted to quit, I called my mom and she passed the phone to friends from TAPS. They made me believe I could do anything, not just for Michael, but for myself.” “Carole with TAPS helped me reached the top of the hill to the finish line,” continued Sasha, “My mom, my baby and Elaine wrapped me in their arms after I crossed. Having so many people believe in me, believe in our journey and support our struggles, is the most heartwarming thing to have in life.” “It was Patrick’s first run ever and he did fantastic,” said Elaine Kinnee, DI WRSS and EAP. “It was a successful weekend, very somber but sweet moment for them both to finish the run in memory of their loved one.” Sasha’s husband, Michael Bradford, was posthumously awarded the Department of Defense’s Defense of Freedom medal and DynCorp International Chairman’s Purple Star Award in 2014 for his ultimate sacrifice on the CSTC-A program in Afghanistan. Patrick’s father, Dick McEvoy, served as the program manager for the ANA/ANP program and was killed earlier this year in a terrorist attack in Afghanistan. DI is the first private company to form an official partnership with TAPS to provide support to families of fallen DI personnel. Through this agreement, TAPS and DI’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP) work together to provide survivors of DI employees comfort and care through comprehensive services and programs including peer-based emotional support, case work assistance, connections to community-based care, and grief and trauma resources. “Grief is such an unimaginable journey but with the help of TAPS together we give our families that invaluable support while embracing them to give them hope and never stop believing in them,” adds Elaine. The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivor (TAPS) is the national organization providing compassionate care for the families of America’s fallen military heroes and has offered support to more than 50,000 surviving family members of our fallen military and their caregivers since 1994. TAPS provides peer-based emotional support, grief and trauma resources, grief seminars for adults, Good Grief Camps for children, case work assistance, connections to community-based care, and a 24/7 resource and information helpline for all who have been affected by a death in the Armed Forces.

" On April 25, 2015, the country of Nepal suffered a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that killed more than 9,000 people and injured more than 23,000. It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since 1934; hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless and entire villages were flattened. The devastation and urgent need for basic necessities prompted the DynCorp International team in Kandahar, Afghanistan, to form a group to help with relief efforts. The DI team partnered with other local organizations that collected monetary donations and supplies such as clothing, bedding and personal hygiene products. “The goal was to provide a network of physical and emotional support during this time of crisis in Nepal,” said Lori Navarro, DynCorp International community care counselor. “The kindness and support was felt from citizens of every nation working here in Afghanistan.” While more than $5,000 was sent to the Red Cross earmarked to Nepal Relief, the logistical delivery of collected donations to Nepal was a challenge. When they could not personally deliver the items to that country, their efforts turned into a new mission, to “pay it forward” to Afghan citizens instead. “The people of Afghanistan are poor like Nepal and we want them to have these goods,” said Karan Bahadur Bam, a Nepalese DI team member who led the project. With help from the Australian Military, two truckloads and 15 triwalls of necessities were transported to Camp Baker for distribution to schools, families and local agencies in Afghanistan",Public

I have been given hope and strength after the tragedy of her loss and am able to better tell our daughter about how her mother was a hero through this experience,” Irungu continued. He added, “The support we have received from DynCorp International has been extraordinary and we hope to maintain a long-term relationship with DI as we continue to remember Lilian.” On July 22, 2014, a suicide bomber on a motorcycle attacked Camp Gibson in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the DI team members served on the Afghanistan Civilian Advisory Support (ACAS) program.

" DynCorp International has been named by the Department of the Army as a top performing industry partner for 2015 as a Tier I supplier. The list is the second annual ranking released as part of the Department of Defense’s Superior Supplier Incentive Program (SSIP) and recognizes contractors with the highest rankings for cost, schedule, performance, quality, and business relations. Heidi Shyu, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, commented, “Being in Tier I is an incredible accomplishment.” SSIP rankings are based on performance data from fiscal years 2012 to 2014 gathered through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). “We remain committed to providing the best equipment to our Soldiers at the best value for the taxpayer,” added Shyu. “SSIP is one of the ways we recognize our top performers.” “This is an effort to look across the Army’s very valuable suppliers and identify those who provide the greatest value in terms of their performance,” said Harry Hallock, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for procurement. “Those suppliers achieving Tier I status are the vendors who consistently achieved or surpassed all contractual requirements, delivering the best products and services to our warfighters.” SSIP was developed to give incentive to those who provide superior military services based on contract obligations and doing business with each of the three services. The program recognizes organizations’ business segments into one of three performance tiers, with “Tier I” being the best. “We’re doing this so people get some feedback from us about how their performance is, relative to their peers,” said Frank Kendall, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. “Then, they can take whatever action they think they need to do to improve their ratings.” Kendall hopes the program will result in increased efficiency and improved performance. “It’s recognition for business units that have been doing a superb job,” Shyu added. “Being in Tier I is ‘a big deal.’”",Public

" DynCorp International is proud to support the Aschiana Foundation, an organization helping to combat the growing number of working street children in Afghanistan. Today, there are an estimated 70,000 working street children in Kabul, Afghanistan, alone. These street children perform an assortment of odd-jobs, such as begging for change, washing car windshields, or collecting scrap metal. Aschiana established Children’s Centers across the country to provide meals, health education, medical treatment, vocational training, recreational activities, schooling and other assistance to street children and their families. This support improves the quality of life for these children and enables them to reintegrate into mainstream society. Their futures become more open to returning to school to finish their education or using their vocational skills to get viable jobs, with the hope they will break out of the cycle of poverty and have a better life. DynCorp International’s senior vice president of Government Relations and Communications, John Gastright, recently visited the Children’s Center in Kabul. There, he met with Engineer Mohammad Yousef, founder and general director, who gave him a tour of the facility. During this tour, he met two children who won a recent art competition, and they presented their winning pieces to him. Gastright also visited classrooms that featured school instruction, sewing training, judo lessons and recreational soccer. “What a remarkable organization. This foundation supported these children through the darkest days of the Russian invasion and the Taliban rule. They get no USG or Afghan Government funding at this time, so our contribution makes a huge impact,” said Gastright. DynCorp International is also a sponsor of Aschiana’s upcoming Annual Benefit Gala taking place May 7, 2015 in Washington, DC. Rula Ghani, first lady of Afghanistan, is attending as an honored guest. The evening will be celebrating 20 years of Aschiana’s work in Afghanistan and will hold a silent auction and bazaar to benefit their efforts in helping these children.",Public

" The DynCorp International team working in support of the NASA Aircraft Maintenance and Operational Support (AMOS) program recently recognized their employee of the year and mechanic of the year at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. Cindy Vasek, Logs and Records custodian, was selected as the 2014 Employee of the Year and Vince Cade, T-38 Flightline/Unscheduled Maintenance mechanic, earned honors as the 2014 Mechanic of the Year. Both recipients share an acute focus on how their roles impact the safety of their coworkers, as well as the lives of astronauts and pilots who fly the aircraft they place into service. Each year the DI NASA AMOS management team solicits input and nominations for employee and mechanic of the year candidates from the entire workforce. Those nominations are then forwarded up the management chain for review and final selection. “We include occurrences of documented customer praise in our evaluations,” said Jim Snowden, executive manager, NASA AMOS contract, DynCorp International. “We generally resolve the lists into two or perhaps three finalists, make one more review round across my senior direct reports for their recommendation and then make a final selection. The result is well-deserved recognition of those individuals who have the support of their peers, a record of significant achievement and whose performance demonstrates core values of the DI Star.” The DI NASA AMOS employee of the year and mechanic of the year each receives a certificate and recognition among their peers and other unique opportunities during the year to demonstrate the company’s appreciation for his or her efforts. In addition, the mechanic receives a custom toolbox designed and personalized by aircraft painter and coworker Mike Huff. Over the years Huff has created more than a dozen unique annual tool box gifts for his fellow award winning mechanics. He said, “I do it because I like to paint and create things that make people look twice. Also it’s cool to give people something that shows appreciation for the job that they do throughout the year. Anytime I’m given full artistic expression I’m going to run with it. That’s the best part, putting what’s in your head to canvass.” Huff created a Houston Texans-based toolbox for Cade, who keeps it in his Texans-themed man-cave. Vince Cade was assigned to the T-38 Flightline/Unscheduled Maintenance Branch in 1994. He displayed first-rate technical skills and exceptionally high standards of aircraft maintenance quality. With more than 21 years of experience in NASA aviation, Cade explained, “The people I work with motivate me. I work with the some of the best aircraft mechanics in the aviation field.” As a Designated System Inspector, he is the last person to validate that required maintenance was properly accomplished according to the technical data. He is also one of a limited number of mechanics capable of performing high power engine runs on the T-38 aircraft. He is continuously sought out and relied upon to accomplish the most difficult tasks regarding maintenance on the T-38 fleet. Cade identified the most important aspects of his job, “The biggest challenge would be keeping up with the demand of the flight schedule and keeping our pilots up and flying; and resolving it by staying on top of the maintenance at all times.” An avid fisherman, he relishes as much time as possible with a baited hook in the water when he is away from work. DI and the astronaut office developed a training program where mechanics and astronauts work side-by-side to enhance the mechanical skills of the astronauts. Cade confirmed, “My favorite thing to do is the astronaut field maintenance training program. I get to work one-on-one with the astronauts.” He provides guidance during all phases of aircraft maintenance explaining the importance of tool and Foreign Object Damage (FOD) control, use of tools, and some troubleshooting. The skills the astronauts gained from the training provided will be used when the astronaut travels to the International Space Station. This program was had been so effective, the training team was awarded the NASA Innovation Award. Whether training astronauts or focusing on his daily maintenance duties, safety is paramount to Cade. “I have a family which I go home to each day. I work with the thought that the astronauts and pilots have families also. Safety is extremely important so they get to go home each day just as I do.” Said Tim Wolard, director of maintenance. “His determination to quickly repair aircraft with quality ensured all aircraft flew safely and never placed a pilot in any danger. Vince is capable of working with no direction and often times prioritized the maintenance to best benefit the flight schedule. Vince is respected by all mechanics and the customer and truly deserves to be awarded the Mechanic of the Year.” Wolard’s comments underscore Cade’s belief that the most important example he can provide is “to respect others and take great pride in what you do.” Vasek was recognized for her consistent level of achievement as a critical member of the DI maintenance control team. With 36 years of service within NASA aviation her knowledge and experience of the NASA Aircraft Information System (NAMIS) exceeds nearly every user within the Flight Operations Directorate. She is routinely called upon by mechanics, managers, and customers for her expertise. Her diligent efforts help prevent overflying any critical aircraft assets in the fleet. Safety is always a prevalent thought for Vasek, who said, “We fix aircraft. Pilots fly them. The mechanics and pilots are my friends and I want everyone to go home safely at the end of the day.” She treasures the opportunity to work with her husband, Mike, a respected DI mechanic. “I love working with my husband! It’s nice to be able to discuss work and the day’s activities with someone who knows and gets what you are talking about. We are celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary in April, so I guess working together hasn’t hurt our marriage!” During a recent inspection, the auditors commented on her professionalism and standards of conduct. In fact she was cited in the final report for a Commendable Finding: “Ms. Cindy Vasek is exceptionally proficient in NAMIS utilization. Her dedication to ensuring the integrity of the data has become even more apparent after detailed discussion and review of the Johnson Space Center NAMIS Maintenance Database.” In another instance of her proactive commitment to safety and quality, Vasek took upon herself to monitor the tool/calibration department during a four week period when the calibration manager was out. She also provided direction and training to the temporarily assigned custodian, greatly reducing a single point failure. During the period, she tracked upcoming calibration tools from over a dozen departments each week ensuring tools were ready for pickup and delivered back to the shops in a timely manner following calibration. Vasek chose to support the tool/calibration department, a regular full time job in itself, and still performed at a high level as the Logs and Records Custodian. These actions support her beliefs about the lessons she would like to pass along, “To try offer solutions to problems and not just identify problems. Share information to assist others in performing their jobs well.” Her nomination letter concluded, “Cindy Vasek clearly displayed the DI core values and projected those values on a daily basis. Cindy’s ability to complete work accurately, efficiently, and on-time has helped DI succeed in the technical aspect of the contract. She is routinely recognized by the mechanics and the customer as the resident expert and is called upon for various tasks on a daily basis. Cindy is vital to the success of the contract and to the customer and is worthy of this recognition.” Multitalented and with enthusiastic family support, Vasek revealed “I’m into home improvements. I know how to lay brick, set tile and I enjoy sewing. I’m close to my parents and daughter, and I just love being a grandma to my beautiful granddaughter, Annie. She calls me Mimi!” Having started her NASA aviation career just two weeks out of high school, Vasek said “Working with the NASA organization at JSC has been a great adventure. Just getting to play a small part in many historical events is something I will enjoy sharing with my granddaughter when she gets older.”",Public
"  DynCorp International has partnered with the U.S. Army Reserve in their Cyber Private Public Partnership Program. The program aims to address the need for experts in the cyber domain by enhancing soldiers’ development and retention in this field. “The demand for these cyber security professionals and cyber experienced Soldiers far outpaces the current inventory,” said Lt. Gen. Jeffery Talley, Chief of United States Army Reserve. As part of this partnership, DI will help encourage the exploration of cyber initiatives by providing Army personnel and veterans with applicable employment opportunities. The program will also support soldiers by enhancing their skills, education and training to develop mission-ready professionals who can match their military and civilian career with continuous education opportunities at top tier regional schools. DI is working closely with Drexel University to identify mutually beneficial opportunities. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified cybersecurity as one of six federal workforce occupations facing mission-critical skills gaps, business and industry face similar shortages. According to a recent GAO report, an estimated 40,000 cyber security professionals are needed just to satisfy the government’s demand. DynCorp International’s support of U.S. military personnel has earned the Company, as well as several of its team members recognition such as Service Member Patriot Awards. DI also recognizes the experience and dedication that veterans contribute to our business as team members and business partners. Victory Media has selected DI as one of the nation’s Top 100 Military-Friendly Employers® for eight years in a row and DI also earned a spot on Military Times’ 2014 list of “Best for Vets” employers.

This is accomplished by developing a supportive environment for Soldiers, Veterans, and Family members striving to create and enhance career and training opportunities.",Public
" DynCorp International’s apprentice program for aviation mechanics is featured in the current issue of Helicopter Maintenance Magazine. The program is based at McClellan Air Park, California, and also supports the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). “An apprenticeship is a combination of on-the-job training and related classroom instruction under the supervision of a journey-level craft person or trade professional in which workers learn the practical and theoretical aspects of a highly-skilled occupation,” said Jeffrey Cavarra, DynCorp International program director. As the availability of licensed, qualified mechanics decreases, DI’s apprenticeship program has been successful in providing critical training for professionals in need of required maintenance experience. Many schools offer airframe and powerplant (A&P) and aviation maintenance technology (AMT) programs, but employers often require candidates to also have at least a few years of hands-on maintenance experience. As part of DI’s support of the CAL FIRE aviation program to help suppress and control wildfires, CAL FIRE operates specialized aircraft and finding qualified technicians can be a challenge. To help meet program goals, DI partnered with Sacramento City College (SCC) to recruit current and recently graduated students from the aeronautics program. DI’s initial goal was to obtain a technician helper and SCC recommended a recent A&P license graduate. The candidate was eventually hired and DI, CAL FIRE and SCC all easily recognized the benefits of working together. Deciding to continue the relationship, all parties agreed to develop a working internship program. “Our ongoing working relationship between Sacramento City College’s aeronautics department and DynCorp International’s CAL FIRE program has been of great value to both DI’s CAL FIRE program and SCC’s aeronautics program,” said Phillip Cypret, SCC aeronautics department chairman. For interns selected to the program, they are required to work at the CAL FIRE maintenance depot during the week in addition to attending classes during the school year. They typically take on responsibilities as a technician helper, then move on to complete hands-on maintenance supervised by a lead technician. “As openings become available, employees can be promoted to apprentice technician, journey technician, base mechanic, quality control inspector and ultimately, lead technician. This promotional ladder provides a long-term career path for every employee,” said Cavarra.",Public

"  DynCorp International is participating in the 2015 Army Aviation Association of America (AAAA) Annual Conference taking place March 29-31, 2015, at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel in Nashville, Tenn. The event will highlight Army Aviation mission solutions. The AAAA-sponsored event brings the Army Aviation community together to discuss solutions for warfighters and will include several networking and professional development opportunities. DI team members will be on hand to discuss the DynAviation Group’s capabilities and offerings in the Technology Learning Center. DI’s history in aviation began in 1946 when two WWII veterans launched California Eastern Airways, a cargo and passenger airline. In 1951, our predecessor company was among the first to deploy technical teams to the field to maintain aircraft under the USAF Contract Field Teams (CFT) program. Aviation remains at the core of DI’s business, with operations today in more than 100 locations worldwide. The Company has stayed true to its roots with continued growth in aviation maintenance, and has expanded its capabilities and customers around the globe. DI’s DynAviation Group: The Army Aviation Association of America (AAAA) was formed in early 1957 by a small group of senior aviation officers in the active Army, the Reserve Forces of the U.S. Army and industry. Their mission is to support the United States Army Aviation soldiers and their families by providing networking, mentoring and professional development opportunities. They also recognize excellence through several award programs such as Soldier of the Year and Unit of the Year. The AAAA Scholarship Foundation is another valuable resource provided, which awarded $427,000 in scholarship funds to 263 outstanding students thanks to generous donors.",Public
"  Every year before the busy wildfire season in California, DynCorp International team members help prepare California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) aircraft to help contain the fires to conserve property, lives and the environment. Fire season typically takes place between April through November, so airplanes undergo annual inspections, repairs and routine maintenance in the winter months. However, in recent years, the California fire season has gotten longer due to dry conditions in the region, making CAL FIRE’s mission all the more vital. In support of firefighting forces on the ground, the CAL FIRE emergency response air program utilizes 22 Grumman S-2T 1,200 gallon airtankers, 12 UH-1H Super Huey helicopters and 14 OV-10A airtactical aircraft. During annual inspection season, most of the aircraft are brought to McClellan Air Force Base before being sent to CAL FIRE’s 12 air attack and nine helitack bases throughout the state. Each aircraft goes through a multi-point inspection per State of California requirements and specialized maintenance for the CAL FIRE mission. “There is a lot involved in keeping a Cold War-era aircraft up and running. They’ve been modernized but the airframe itself is still an older airframe, even though it looks all-new on the outside. There are still a lot of not just upgrades, but maintenance, that goes on with keeping the structure and airframe up-to-date and safe for the pilots and especially the mission that these aircraft are tasked with,” said Jesse Potswald, DynCorp International S2-T Maintenance supervisor. For its commitment to aviation maintenance training, the DynCorp International CAL FIRE team was recently recognized with an FAA Diamond Award for Excellence. The award honors organizations that aim to improve safety through technical training programs. The 2015 award is the fourth consecutive for the DI CAL FIRE team and also recognizes completion by all of DI’s eligible maintenance technicians of specialized, continuous training in aircraft systems and regulations. DynCorp International support the CAL FIRE aviation program by flying and maintaining CAL FIRE’s Grumman S-2T fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft. DI team members also fully maintain and service UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots.",Public

Through this program, DI flies and maintains Grumman S-2T fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft, and fully maintains and services UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots. “This award represents the partnership between DI and CAL FIRE and our continuing focus to never stop improving,” said Jeffrey Cavarra, CAL FIRE program manager. DI team members operate and manage several Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) facilities at Air Force and Navy locations throughout the U.S. to provide T-6A and T-6B aircraft spare parts and support equipment. This program earns its third consecutive FAA Diamond Award. T-6 program director Blake Mathies said, “The FAA Diamond Award designation is extremely important to our program. It reinforces the outstanding performance we have been providing to our customer and lets them know we will continue to hold ourselves to the highest of standards.” The Diamond Award is the highest corporate award given by the FAA, and the program includes both individual and corporate recognition. The FAA’s Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) Award program is based on the commitment of maintenance technicians in each program to advance safety by actively participating in training programs to further their technical knowledge. In addition to the Diamond Award, which is presented to the company, each mechanic receives an Aviation Maintenance Technician award based on the number of training hours logged. To earn the Diamond award, each program is required to have 100 percent of its eligible maintenance team complete specialized training in aircraft systems, regulations and FAA rules over the course of a calendar year.",Public

" The next class of NASA astronauts prepares to complete their certification with the help of a team of schedulers who track their progress, schedule their training and help them achieve readiness for assignment. Beginning October 2014, the astronaut schedulers, with a combined 32 years of experience in the astronaut office, joined DynCorp International (DI) as a result of the company’s expanded role in supporting NASA’s Johnson Space Center and the astronaut corps. In addition to the aircraft maintenance, operations and logistics services already provided at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas, DI was selected by NASA to assume responsibility for scheduling astronaut training and administrating public appearance requests for the corps. Under the current contract, DI has been working directly with NASA’s astronaut crews for two-and-a-half years through maintenance, safety assurance and operations services on the astronauts’ T-38 training aircraft. Depending on their role within the astronaut corps, each astronaut must obtain a specific number of flight hours in the T-38 aircraft every year to maintain flight certification. Now with the addition of the Astronaut Scheduling Office and the Astronaut Appearance Office (AAO) personnel, DI has a more significant role in supporting the astronaut corps from scheduling their preparation and training, to sharing their experiences with the public upon their return from space. “Our team is proud to contribute to America’s space program,” said Jim Snowden, executive manager, NASA Aircraft Maintenance Operational Support (AMOS) contract, DynCorp International. “We are committed to helping NASA achieve maximum efficiency in astronaut scheduling and the team has been performing flawlessly despite their heavy workload.” The DI astronaut schedulers are responsible for ensuring that astronaut training objectives and requirements are met through on-schedule, properly sequenced and integrated training. In 2014, unassigned astronauts and the current class of astronaut candidates completed more than 35,000 hours of training. This rigorous training prepares them for their upcoming assignments like missions aboard the International Space Station, a variety of technical assignments and required proficiency training. The scheduling office also maintains a NASA database for all astronauts and international partners that includes educational history, job titles, hours flown and training records. In addition to tactical training, expeditionary training is a significant part of an astronaut’s training. Week-long survival camping trips in the wild with a select group of peers, spelunking in total darkness for days at a time, winter survival training in Russia, or working in Antarctica for an extended period are all examples of this kind of remote training. “Expeditionary training is used to put potential and assigned crew members into uncomfortable situations to test them physically, mentally, and psychologically,” said Donna Fugitt, astronaut scheduler, DynCorp International. “The idea is to see how well-equipped they are to handle stressful conditions and to observe how they work as team. This is used to identify their strengths and weaknesses, and to prepare them for long-duration spaceflight missions.” In addition to the critical scheduling support in training, the DI team members in the astronaut office help NASA achieve its public outreach, education and external relations goals through administration and public relations services for all astronaut appearance requests worldwide. The AAO personnel are dedicated to helping returning flight crews and all other astronauts share the excitement of space exploration to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and astronauts. Through carefully coordinated appearances, the AAO team helps expand the reach of the astronaut corps via virtual and in-person appearances. Last year, 43 astronauts completed 427 individual appearances. The training coordination, scheduling, appearance administration and publicity work was added to the NASA AMOS contract, which began June 2012. Under the AMOS contract, DI has been providing NASA with aircraft maintenance, safety reliability, quality assurance, modifications, operational services and engineering support at Ellington Field at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas; NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.; NASA facilities in El Paso, Texas; Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., and other locations worldwide as required. The AMOS team helped grow the company’s role in supporting the Johnson Space Center by being a trusted partner. This trust stems from the AMOS team consistently demonstrating the values and attributes of the DI Star including satisfying customers, improving processes and meeting commitments.",Public

" DynCorp International (DI) was awarded a contract in 2014 to provide Global Information Technology Modernization (GITM) services for the U.S. Department of State (DoS) Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM). In working with several Centers of Excellence (COEs) throughout the Company, the program successfully transitioned to DI systems, positioning the team to best serve the customer. “Program transitions involve coordination between the program team, COEs and the customer to understand how functional areas will interact once the program is up and running,” said Josh Creson, DynCorp International program manager. Samantha Yanger, DynCorp International program and project specialist commented, “Communication with COEs and program points of contact is critical up front. The more defined processes and detailed standard procedures can be identified, the better. Knowing the hand-off points in a process has had the greatest impact for Team DI on the GITM program.” In any program transition, several factors are considered including finance, quality, performance excellence, logistics, procurement, and overhead functions such as human resources, recruiting, business technology, supply chain, facilities and security. Throughout the transition process, the GITM team utilized a dedicated transition manager that acted as a liaison to all parties, which enabled the program manager to focus on critical areas such as staffing, daily operations, finance and contracts management. “Having a Program Management Office (PMO) at the program level was an integral part of our success,” said Creson. “Through the PMO we were able to identify counterparts at each COE and work seamlessly with the customer to ensure their requirements were being met.” “With the PMO support, we were able to devote our time to identifying potential challenges and clearly defining each team members’ roles to address those issues. We were also able to bolster our relationship with the customer by being transparent with them throughout the transition process,” Creson added. “Teamwork and hiring the right people have played a key role in our success,” said Lee Kind, DynCorp International Quality Services manager. “While experience is certainly important, hiring team members willing to learn, work together and grow with the program is even more important and will take us to the next level.” DI Business Technology and Operations teams also worked closely with the GITM team to provide their expertise, templates and tools for performance reporting and increase program capabilities. Through ongoing efforts to standardize DI’s program transition processes, the Program Management (PM) team worked closely with the GITM team to provide tools developed specifically to ease the transition process. In addition, the PM team was able to gather information to help future programs succeed. “Work Breakdown Structures, Organization Breakdown Structures and Cost Breakdown Structures provided by the PM and draft program plans provided by the Performance Excellence COE were very helpful in guiding the transition,” Kind added. “A fairly seamless transition allowed our team to focus on improving processes and establishing quality and performance goals early on,” said Creson. “We are constantly challenging the status-quo by bouncing around new ideas and identifying better solutions that can benefit the customer as we aim to not only support program requirements, but also ensure long-term success.” As part of its efforts to better serve the Department of State, the GITM team recently moved into a new facility located in Lorton, Va. The new facility increases program capabilities by providing additional warehouse storage for hardware in a layout designed with lean six sigma principles that improves both efficiency and effectiveness simultaneously. Thus, DI can now provide additional support for future DoS work. Timothy Glazar, DynCorp International senior director, National Security Solutions, IT and Mission Support said, “The GITM program provides DI with a valuable opportunity to expand our relationship within the Department of State, a valued long-term customer, and highlights our capabilities to conduct IT and supply chain management operations around the world. At all levels of the program, the team has proven to be a valued partner to our IRM customer, provided stability through the transition period, and is smartly identifying new ways to operate which will ultimately transform the way business is conducted in the IT Modernization of Embassies around the globe.” “As we move further from transition into operations, we continue to learn and grow at every turn, we remain excited and committed to this critically important mission. Personally, it has been a terrific opportunity for me to see something that started more than two years ago with a Request for Information submission come to life and I am very proud to be associated with this important ground-breaking program for DI and with the entire team making it happen every day.” In June 2014, DI was awarded a task order from the DoS Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM) to provide global information technology services. Under this task order, the DI team modernizes IT equipment deployed at DoS posts and bureaus. The Vanguard 2.2.3 Global Information Technology Modernization (GITM) program encompasses the entire supply chain life cycle support for the refresh, deployment and installation of classified and unclassified desktop and server equipment at more than 300 locations overseas and stateside.",Public

" DynCorp International team members working in support of the Afghanistan National Police/Ministry of Interior Development Program (AMDP) recently developed and launched a software program to be used by the Afghan Ministry of Interior (MOI). The software is designed to aid in budget planning and analysis. Amos Holts, DynCorp International senior advisor and mentor, played an integral role in developing the software and provided hands-on training to MOI personnel. Personnel were trained on data entry for their respective budget areas and taught how to analyze results to develop realistic, time-phased budgets. “It is an honor and quite humbling to be able to provide a tool that allows the Afghan MOI to better evaluate their financial resources and develop economically,” said Holts. The DI team designed the software to allow for greater MOI spending transparency and was also translated into Dari to increase its user base. “We hope that by using this new tool the MOI staff will be able to eventually develop, analyze and execute with the financial resources at their disposal independent of DI advisors,” said Holts. Through the Afghanistan National Police/Ministry of Interior Development Program (AMDP), DI provides executive level mentoring, instructor training and certification, field training, and logistics across Afghanistan. DI executive mentors coach senior Afghan officials with a focus on leadership, management and ethical decision-making skills, and have mentored leaders at the Ministerial level.",Public
" To showcase the unique NASA Super Guppy Transport (SGT) aircraft, maintained by DynCorp International mechanics, the Discovery Channel Canada followed the Super Guppy on a recent cross-country mission from El Paso, Texas, to Long Beach, Calif., to load valuable and futuristic aerospace hardware for final delivery to NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. The mission will be featured on an episode of “Mighty Planes” to be aired in late 2015. As part of DynCorp International’s NASA Aircraft Maintenance and Operational Support (AMOS) contract, DI team members based with the SGT in El Paso, Texas, maintain the uniquely shaped cargo aircraft. The Super Guppy is based in the dry desert climate to help prevent corrosion and decay of vital aircraft parts. DI’s part of the Super Guppy team includes the maintenance manager, four dedicated mechanics, numerous additional mechanics with extensive experience on the aircraft, an aircraft specialist and a flight engineer. Many of these employees discussed on camera how they each play a part in keeping the specialized aircraft in flight and mission ready. The Super Guppy measures more than 48 feet to the top of its tail and has a wingspan of more than 156 feet with a 25-foot diameter cargo bay. Due to fewer handling fixtures and minimal ground support equipment, the SGT is designed for efficient oversized cargo transport. Its hinged nose opens to 110 degrees to allow for easy cargo loading and offloading. The SGT is capable of carrying a maximum payload of 48,000 Pounds with its four powerful Rolls Royce Turbo Jet Engines. The SGT was acquired by NASA from the European Space Agency (ESA) under an International Space Station barter agreement. It is the last of its kind still in operation. Manufactured by Airbus Industries, the aircraft was initially intended to carry ESA experiment equipment to the station as part of two future Space Shuttle flights. Guppy aircraft have been used in several space programs including Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab, to transport spacecraft components. In April 2012, DI was awarded a contract with NASA to provide aircraft maintenance and operational support services at various locations including Ellington Field at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va., NASA facilities in El Paso, Texas, and Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., and other locations worldwide as required.

" During the month of October, DynCorp International’s Multi Sensor Aerial Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (MAISR) Maintenance and Logistics team provided unprecedented support, allowing the Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft to fly more than 1,640 hours combined. The combined flying time, as well as combined Operational Readiness Rates, exceeded contract requirements. “I am consistently impressed with the operational tempo of this program and the commitment of the men and women who support this mission and customer,” said Franklin Paul, DynCorp International (DI) program manager. “Throughout my aviation career I have never seen aircraft fly the hours they do on this program. These aircraft fly almost non-stop, 16 – 20 hours per day and 25 – 27 days per month.  That equates to 410 flight hours per month, per aircraft. The only time each aircraft is not in the air is for scheduled phase maintenance, unscheduled maintenance problems, or to refuel. It’s a true testimony to the DI team’s hard work and teamwork to meet and exceed these tasks.” DI’s MAISR Maintenance and Logistics team also had several additional operational highlights in October 2014. The team completed a 27,000 hour wing spar non-destructive inspection, as well as an installation of an aft wing spar kit. The operation required a total of 262 man hours and was completed ahead of schedule. The team also completed eight phase inspections; a scheduled engine change, two engine build ups and a propeller build up. “The maintainers on this program love their job and they put in long hours and maintained high spirits in order to ensure an excellent product was delivered to the customer,” said David Bramhall, DynCorp International director of Maintenance. In November 2013, DI was awarded a subcontract to provide contractor logistics support in Afghanistan, as part of the MAISR Operations and Sustainment program. DI serves as a subcontractor to AASKI Technology and provides maintenance, pilots, flight operations management and logistics support for two Dash 7 aircraft, a King Air 300 and a King Air 350 in support of aerial platforms. Additionally, DI provides logistical support for 8 aircraft in support of Task Force Observe, Detect, Identify and Neutralize (TF ODIN).

At the event, representatives from 59 countries reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Afghanistan in becoming a secure and stable nation post-2014 drawdown. The conference provided a platform for Afghan government representatives to discuss their vision for reform and for the international community to demonstrate enduring solidarity and support for the country. Newly elected Afghan president Ashraf Ghani was among the featured speakers and laid out his plan to reform Afghanistan. As noted in a news release from the U.K. Department for International Development, Ghani “outlined steps he has already taken to deliver on his ambitious agenda to reform Afghanistan and deliver economic security by tackling corruption, maintaining the progress made on national security and placing women’s and civil rights at the heart of the country’s future prosperity.” “Hearing directly from president Ghani and chief executive Abdullah was incredibly valuable. It provided fresh insights into their agenda for change, and we heard extremely friendly plans for welcoming foreign businesses to Afghanistan,” commented Bret Dalton, DynCorp International country director. The London Conference in Afghanistan also featured speakers such as U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. As 2014 ends, the London Conference on Afghanistan provided a platform for the Government of Afghanistan to set out its commitment to reform, looking ahead in particular to the “Transformation Decade” through to 2024. It is also a moment for the international community to signal its solidarity with the Afghan people, and to reaffirm its long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan’s peaceful development.",Public
" DynCorp International is once again proud to support Project USO Elf, a program that provides local military children with gifts for the holidays. Partnering with the USO of Metropolitan Washington-Baltimore (USO-Metro), DI will help serve hundreds of military families this holiday season. In addition to a corporate sponsorship, DI team members volunteered at events at Fort Belvoir and Fort Meade to help distribute and presents to participating families. Project USO-Elf was established in 2008 when USO-Metro began receiving calls from service members who needed assistance with providing gifts for their children during the holidays. It was also during this time that USO-Metro received an increase in calls from the public wanting to give back to our military and their families. The program began as “Adopt a Military Child” with both the military community and the civilian community interested in supporting our troops. The program evolved from serving about 500 children a year to more than 1,200 and was subsequently changed to “Project USO Elf.” Project USO Elf is open to all local active duty lower enlisted service members. Service members register their children to be sponsored by companies, organizations and individuals/families in the local community and submit a “wish list” for each child. Wish lists are sent to sponsors who purchase the gifts to be distributed at participating local military bases. The USO of Metropolitan Washington-Baltimore has ten locations and a “deployable” Mobile USO that provide signature USO services to the nearly 300,000 military members and their families living in the region and the 150,000 who travel through local airports. The USO’s mission is to lift the spirits of America’s troops and their families.

Kansky delivered a presentation on the Company’s current operating environment, recent key contract wins, opportunities for future new business and third quarter 2014 financial results. He also discussed financial guidance for 2014 and 2015, as well as DI’s amended credit facility. “We kept our eye towards deleveraging – in the third quarter this year we paid down $30 million of debt. That brings us to a total of $90 million for the year and $383 million to date. It’s been an important strategy for the company and we will continue with that theme,” said Kansky. When discussing future opportunities and global and budget challenges, he commented, “DI has the capability to perform all these missions and help the United States’ foreign policy and national security objectives be realized.” In discussing key wins, he mentioned a five-year potential $443 million contract to provide aircraft maintenance and logistics support for T-34, T-44 and T-6 aircraft awarded in October. “It’s an important win for us, not only because it is a large piece of business that’s going to be profitable but also we’ve been looking to expand our footprint with the Navy for quite some time and this win accomplishes that.” The Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2014 Leveraged Finance Conference took place Monday, December 1 to Wednesday, December 3, 2014 at the Boca Raton Resort & Club in Boca Raton, Fla.

" DynCorp International team members in Fort Worth, Texas, and Kuwait celebrated the 239th birthday of the United States Marine Corps on November 10, 2014. The “birthday” commemorates the establishment on the Marine Corps in 1775. In Kuwait, the DI team even invited the Marines stationed at the American Embassy Kuwait to a celebratory lunch. With more than 60 percent of DI’s total workforce having previously served in the U.S. military, occasions such as the Marine Corps birthday hits close to home for many DI team members. In Fort Worth, Texas, a Marine Corps Non-Commissioned Officer sword was used to cut a celebratory cake. Per tradition, the oldest Marine in attendance cuts the cake and presents a piece to the youngest Marine in attendance. “As the youngest Marine at our celebration, it was meaningful to experience the symbolism of the oldest Marine passing on his wisdom to the next generation, emphasizing the fact that Marines take care of young Marines before they look to their own needs,” said Clinton Barkley, DynCorp International Operations manager. On November 10, 1775, the Second Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia passed a resolution stating that “two Battalions of Marines be raised” for service as landing forces with the fleet. This resolution established the Continental Marines and marked the birth date of the United States Marine Corps.

" As part of DynCorp International’s commitment to conducting business honestly and ethically, the Ethics & Compliance team recently launched a new Ethical Dilemmas Discussion series. The discussions have been hosted at several DI worksites and aim to create a culture where DI team members can openly talk about real-world ethical dilemmas. The open discussions, held in group settings, propose hypothetical situations a DI team member may face while conducting business. Team members are then encouraged to discuss how each situation may be resolved, taking into consideration DI’s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and core values. Through the series of discussions, employees are assisted in grappling with grey areas that are thought provoking and part of doing business, especially in a global organization. “Our goal is to encourage all employees to feel comfortable speaking freely and collaborating with others about dilemmas they face in their day-to-day work,” said Joe Kale, DynCorp International chief compliance officer. “Often with these ‘dilemmas’ there isn’t just one right answer and this is a valuable opportunity to provide a forum to discuss different perspectives on realistic situations we all currently face or will encounter in the future.” DI’s Business Ethics & Compliance Program is designed to foster a free and open atmosphere that allows and encourages employees to make inquiries, raise questions, express work-related concerns or report business ethics violations or violations of law, regulations, policies or procedures, without fear of retaliation. The program consists of a robust Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which connects our behaviors to business practices. It is a handbook for doing the right thing and is an essential tool to help employees make the right decisions. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct translates DI’s core values – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform and We Do the Right Thing – into action.",Public

" During the month of November 2014, DynCorp International team members in McLean, Va., collected new or gently used blankets to support the Northern Virginia Regional Commission’s blanket drive to benefit Syrian refugees living in Turkey. DI team members donated dozens of blankets and monetary donations throughout the month to support the drive. The first blanket drive was held in 2013, organized by the American Turkish Friendship Association and its partners after an intercultural study trip to Turkey. They were given an opportunity to visit a Syrian refugee camp and asked how they could help. Some of the refugees explained their need for blankets during the cold winter months so the group worked to gather thousands of blankets, as well as monetary donations.

" DynCorp International pilot, Geoffrey “Craig” Hunt, was honored by hundreds at a memorial service held Tuesday, October 21, 2014. Hunt was tragically killed on October 7, 2014, while flying an S-2T air tanker deployed to suppress and control a wildfire at Yosemite National Park. He supported DI’s program with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as CAL FIRE. Fellow CAL FIRE pilots, firefighters, and other first responders joined Hunt’s family as well as DI and CAL FIRE representatives to honor his life and show their respects. James Myles, DynCorp International senior vice president, DynAviation, spoke of the bravery of first responders and the specialized skills required of CAL FIRE pilots. “I know why Craig Hunt volunteered to come and fly with CAL FIRE. He wanted to make a difference,” said Myles. “He fought fires and flew the way he lived his life – to the fullest, thinking of others before himself, with no regrets.” Hunt, of San Jose, Calif., was a U.S. military veteran with a proud history of service to others. He served as a U.S. Navy P3 pilot from 1975-1984 and served in the Reserves for 20 years. He supported DI’s CAL FIRE program for more than 12 years. “Craig, who we called ‘The Professor,’ was a valued member of the DI team and he will be greatly missed,” said Jeffrey Cavarra, DynCorp International program director. Hunt earned a Master’s degree in Business from the University of Southern California and a Masters in Biochemistry from the University of Santa Cruz, and served as a chemistry teacher in the off season at the University of Santa Cruz. He had a love for flying, golfing, fishing, hiking, bird watching, scuba diving, math/sciences, teaching, and dogs. He is survived by his wife, Sally Keenan Hunt; two daughters, Sarah Hunt Lauterbach and Nancy Hunt; two brothers, one sister and his father. DynCorp International has worked with CAL FIRE since 2001 helping suppress and control wild land fires in California. As part of the program, DI flies and maintains Grumman S-2T fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft, and fully maintains and services civilian UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots. Operating from across California, aircraft can reach most fires within 20 minutes. The OV-10A aircraft fly over fires, directing the air tankers and helicopters to critical areas for retardant and water drops. The retardant used to slow or retard the spread of a fire is a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum-thickening agent, and a coloring agent. All CAL FIRE Aircraft are strategically located throughout the state at airbases and helicopter bases. During high fire activity, CAL FIRE may move aircraft to better provide statewide air support. The department’s firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft respond to an average of more than 5,600 wild land fires each year. Those fires burn more than 172,000 acres annually.",Public

" Casals & Associates, a DynCorp International company, recently supported a group of young actors in El Salvador in putting together a play that raises awareness of social issues affecting Salvadoran youth. The Casals team partnered with the drama theatre ensemble, “Grupo Realista” (“True to Life Group”), who held their debut performance of “Restricted Access,” to nearly 200 students in their community. Casals Democracy Strengthening Program (DSP) director, Carlos Guerrero, met the founding members of the group as they performed at a community fair. “I couldn’t help but notice their enthusiasm,” said Guerrero. “Their passion for using performing arts to disseminate objectives that paralleled that of the DSP program made for an easy partnership.” Guerrero worked with the group and proposed a small acting project, engaging a local theater director who would help develop ideas and talents with the actors. The youth group chose the name “Grupo Realista” because they wanted to portray real-life situations of social issues affecting many young Salvadorans like them and raise awareness. In partnership with Casals, the group gathered on a weekly basis for six-hour drama workshops to strengthen cohesiveness, develop and refine performance skills, learn how to set up a stage and write an original screenplay. “Restricted Access” was performed at a public school in San Salvador where about 170 students from first to ninth grade enjoyed the play and learned about the recently passed right to access to public information and its importance. “Youth groups like Grupo Realista can play a very effective role in reaching out to audiences and marginalized communities where providing easy-to-understand information ensures access for all,” said Guerrero. Convinced that the performing arts is an ideal vehicle to undertake advocacy of key issues, the DSP has entered the second phase of this pilot project which will carry the group on a tour across the country to perform “Restricted Access” in many popular venues. “The fact that these young actors have accomplished all of this, now have a positive outlook for what they can attain, and are contributing to the future of the country is a promising parallel benefit. Hopefully, the youth of El Salvador will learn more from their example than just citizen rights,” said Guerrero. DynCorp International, through Casals & Associates, works as an implementing partner with USAID on the Democracy Strengthening Program (DSP) in El Salvador. USAID/El Salvador’s assistance focuses on strengthening the justice system, supports anti-corruption reforms and public-private partnerships to prevent crime and violence.",Public

" DynCorp International has been awarded a contract modification on its aircraft maintenance support program to provide aircraft maintenance services at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas. The award is the fifth option year on a contract initially awarded in 2009. The modification is valued at $42.5 million. Under this contract, DI team members provide aircraft maintenance services for the 80th Flying Training Wing on T-6 and T-38 aircraft. The mission of the Air Education and Training Command’s 80th Flying Wing is unique, providing undergraduate pilot training for the U.S. and NATO allies in the Euro NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training program (ENJJPT). The Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program (ENJJPT) is the world’s only multi-nationally managed and manned pilot training program whose mission is to produce the world’s finest NATO pilots with the skills and attitude to succeed in fighter aviation. ENJPPT was established in 1973 as the rapidly rising cost of pilot training and the need to improve NATO air forces led a group of European nations to consider combining efforts to develop a consolidated training program. In 1974, the U.S. joined the working group that included Canada, Italy, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The group eventually determined that the U.S. would be the most appropriate host for the program after considering factors such as flying weather, training airspace, existing facilities and program growth potential. In 1978, the U.S. was formally selected to host the ENJJPT program for 10 years as a short-term solution, while studies on relocation to a European base continued. The ENJJPT program is unique for its four distinct training programs. It provides Undergraduate Pilot Training, Pilot Instructor Training, Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) and IFF Upgrade Instructor Pilot training. Approximately 200 student pilots “earn their wings” annually after a 55-week, three-phase training regimen. About 80 new instructor pilots are trained annually and up to 150 pilots transition through IFF each year. All this training is supported by a staff of more than 1,300 military, civilian and contract personnel employing T-6A, T-37B and T-38C training aircraft.",Public
" DynCorp International team members in Fort Worth, Texas, raised $875 to benefit the American Heart Association (AHA) as part of the Tarrant County Heart Walk. The event took place at the Fort Worth Stockyards on September 13, 2014 and 25 team members participated on Team DynCorp International-Alliance. “Our team was proud to be able to support the AHA’s mission and spread heart health awareness,” said Chanel Mann, DynCorp International internal communications manager. The Heart Walk is a three mile non-competitive event with a one mile survivor route.

" DynCorp International employees donated clothes, shoes, blankets and other serviceable items to the local community in Afghanistan through an effort called “Operation Donation.” Working in partnership with International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) teams from Bulgaria and Australia, seven large boxes of donations were collected and distributed in the humanitarian assistance effort. “In addition to many years of conflict, Afghan citizens have been affected by natural disasters including flooding and earthquakes,” said Clara Butterfield, DynCorp International project controls specialist and initiator of Operation Donation. “We were compelled to find a way to help and got a great turnout from our team members.” DI team members will continue to collect and donate supplies such as blankets, especially as winter approaches in Afghanistan.

" DynCorp International director of Security Operations, Timothy Bartels, was recently honored with a Service Member Patriot award from the Office of the Secretary of Defense Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR). Bartels was nominated by colleague Trenton Dugan, DynCorp International Security administrator. “Tim has been an amazing manager to work for, straight forward in communications and actions. Immediately upon my return in July from one year of military duty, I knew that DI needed to be recognized. This award is designated specifically to a supervisor even though it has been the company as a whole that has supported me,” commented Dugan. “From the moment that I returned from duty, Tim has supported my actions and looked to see how my experiences with the military could benefit the company as a whole.” “Multiple times I have been placed on orders lasting anywhere from a week to a year. Each time DI has always offered to help in any way they can, even providing me with the resources to work for short periods of time remotely. After being with the company for almost three years it’s great to have the support that is often not found by many other employers,” continued Dugan. An employee serving in the National Guard or Reserve, or the spouse of a Guard or Reserve member, may nominate individual supervisors and bosses for support provided directly to the nominating Service member and his or her family. The Patriot Award reflects the efforts made to support citizen warriors through a wide-range of measures including flexible schedules, time off prior to and after deployment, caring for families and granting leaves of absence if needed. Patriot Awards are awarded to individual supervisors, not to an entire staff or organization as a whole. An individual may nominate as many supervisors as they would like, and each will receive a Patriot Award certificate and accompanying lapel pin. To recognize employers who support their Guard and Reserve employees, ESGR grants a series of Department of Defense (DoD) awards: Many of these awards are progressive in nature, with each building upon the previous. For example, an employer must have had at least one supervisor or other representative honored with a Patriot Award and must have signed a Statement of Support to be eligible for consideration for the Above and Beyond Award. Recognizing supportive employers is vital to ESGR’s mission. ESGR’s 54 State Committees actively promote awards as a key element in furthering employer support, while strengthening relationships between service members and employers. DoD awards honor the sacrifices made by so many employers year after year.",Public
" The DynCorp International War Reserve Materiel (WRM) program has demonstrated its commitment to continuous improvement by implementing a new initiative aimed to drive down the cost per unit to produce, reduce overtime hours, improve throughput, increase safety and improve quality. DI’s WRM team worked together to develop a Lean strategy to better support its customers, the U.S. Air Force Central Command (USAFCENT) and Acquisition Management Integration Center (AMIC). For example, the WRM team in Thumrait, Oman, recently completed five projects focusing on reducing the vehicle acceptance timeframe by half and redesigning a process flow for heater maintenance that reduced waste and resulted in a 60 percent reduction in labor hour consumption. “The DI WRM program’s pursuit of excellence through continuous improvement has empowered the team at Thumrait,” said Bill Womack, DynCorp International site manager. “Implementing Lean processes allows our team members to better engage in projects and take control in their areas of responsibility.” “Lean has been an extremely effective and beneficial tool our employees can implement time and time again without requiring constant assistance from quality professionals,” Said Edward West, DynCorp International program quality manager. The WRM team plans to implement more Lean projects in the following months focusing on safety and continuing to refine skills. “The WRM program’s focus on continuous improvement has been an investment which has paid significant dividends in customer satisfaction, reduced costs and increased efficiencies,” said Bruno Eddy the DynCorp International program director. “Continuous improvement has become more than a slogan or banner for WRM; it has become a cornerstone of our program management approach.” In addition to future projects, the DI WRM team has scheduled three more training courses in the next few months. “Even through a busy performance period supporting the warfighter across the Middle East – opening and closing sites and shipping hundreds of thousands of short tons of cargo by air, sea and land – the team took the time to improve our processes and are the benefiting from that investment!” DynCorp International has supported the WRM program since 2000.

" Each year, DynCorp International team members working in support of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) gather to recognize the efforts of their maintenance technician team. Recently several DI pilots working at Columbia Air Attack Base nominated base mechanic, Michael Silva, for the Mechanic of the Year Award, awarded by DI and CAL FIRE program leadership. “Mike’s work ethic and unmatched attention to detail are truly incredible. He spends hours every day inspecting, greasing, and fixing even the most minor items regardless if the temperatures are over 100 degrees in the middle of the afternoon. He just never seems to stop or run out of energy! It’s not an exaggeration to say he inspects our aircraft with a flashlight and a mirror, or is continually checking our planes as we hot-load, or spends late hours until he is absolutely satisfied it is perfect. His unwavering energy and constant care gives us the confidence to know we are flying an impeccably maintained and safe aircraft, so we can focus on the job,” said DynCorp International pilot, Rich Schlink. The Columbia Air Attack Base pilots even had “I like Mike” shirts made to show their appreciation for Silva’s work. “There is a true sense of respect and camaraderie between the DI aerial firefighting pilots and the DI maintenance providers, which is an integral part of this program’s success,” said Jeffrey Cavarra, DynCorp International program director. “I even joke with them about the shirts but they love wearing them!” The award ceremony will take place in May 2015 and nominations are taken throughout the year. DynCorp International has worked with CAL FIRE since 2001 helping suppress and control wild land fires in California. As part of the program, DI flies and maintains Grumman S-2T fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft, and fully maintains and services civilian UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots. Operating from across California, aircraft can reach most fires within 20 minutes. The OV-10A aircraft fly over fires, directing the air tankers and helicopters to critical areas for retardant and water drops. The retardant used to slow or retard the spread of a fire is a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum-thickening agent, and a coloring agent. All CAL FIRE Aircraft are strategically located throughout the state at airbases and helicopter bases. During high fire activity, CAL FIRE may move aircraft to better provide statewide air support. The department’s firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft respond to an average of more than 5,600 wild land fires each year. Those fires burn more than 172,000 acres annually.",Public

" DynCorp International team members working in support of the NASA Aircraft Maintenance Operational Support (AMOS) program recently helped make aviation history – aiding in the reconstruction of a WB-57 aircraft 40 years after its last mission. The jet, now identified as N927, had been retired from military service in the summer of 1972 and stored in “The Boneyard” at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz. The N927 now holds the record for the longest time an aircraft has been in extended storage before returning to flying status. The combined efforts of DI and NASA engineers, mechanics and logisticians made this landmark achievement possible. The DI and NASA teams provided more than 50 experts with vast experience in WB-57 operational, maintenance, engineering and logistics for select hands-on contributions last year during varying stages of the regeneration in Colorado. For example, DI hydraulic specialists hand-fabricated, pressure tested, and installed hundreds of hydraulic lines. Several logistics challenges were overcome as most original parts are no longer in production, and the original manufacturers often are no longer in business. DI team members amassed the required parts, special tools and related products to complete the project and perform almost 1,400 tail-number-specific issues. “The pride that every member of the DI/NASA team took in rebuilding this aircraft was evident in the final product. It barely resembled the weather-beaten hulk that was pulled from the Arizona desert. It had been transformed into a near-pristine machine, probably in better condition than when it rolled off the production line so many years earlier,” said Tom Parent, DynCorp International WB-57 pilot. NASA’s WB-57s feature important modifications compared to the originals. Each one, including the N927, has twice as much wingspan and twice the power of the original versions. As a result, NASA WB-57s are capable of operation for extended periods at altitudes well in excess of 60,000 feet. They can fly for approximately 6.5 hours and have a range of approximately 2,500 miles with a useful payload capacity of more than 8,800 pounds. With the N927 joining NASA’s expanding fleet, more options are available to provide the types of payload integration and research platform support for which the aircraft has become noteworthy. Sensors may be mounted at various sites around the aircraft and the Universal Pallet System (UPS) helps accommodate a myriad of payload options.",Public

" DynCorp International team members volunteered their time Saturday, August 4 at USO of Metropolitan Washington-Baltimore (USO-Metro) events in support of the Operation Back to School program. USO-Metro’s Operation Back to School program provides backpacks complete with school supplies to thousands of school-aged children through special events at Fort Belvoir and Fort Meade. DI has proudly supported this program since 2012. DI team members helped set up stations at the USO Warrior and Family center at Fort Belvoir and at the USO Center at Fort Meade for local military children to complete. The educational stations were based on school subjects including math, geography, science, history and art. Each participant received a “report card” which was stamped after completing each station. Once completed, they presented their report cards in exchange for a backpack with school supplies to get them ready for the upcoming school year. The children and their families also enjoyed snacks and music as part of the event. Between both locations, more than 1,200 families attended the event. USO-Metro’s Operation Back to School program is held annually to benefit local military children as they prepare for the upcoming school year. Operation Back to School is a fun, one-day program held at Fort Belvoir, Va., and Fort Meade, Md., for military kids ages 5 -12 where they participate in activities that incorporate core subjects such as reading, math, science, history and art. Once they complete all educational activities, each child receives a backpack complete with new school supplies. USO of Metropolitan Washington-Baltimore is the largest center chartered by USO.

" On the heels of Independence Day, DynCorp International team members in Fort Worth, Texas, kept the patriotic spirit going all month by participating in a decoration contest to raise donations for the Dallas-Fort Worth USO. The USO Center at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport recently reported a 50 percent drop in donations used for gift packets. However, the number of military members passing through the center – nearly 170,000 last year — has remained steady, so DI team members rallied to gather the needed donations. DI employees formed teams to decorate donation boxes and collect items such as travel size snacks, single serve chips, single serve peanuts, snack crackers and trial size toiletries. Dozens of donations were collected and delivered to the USO center to replenish its inventory.

" From February 2011 through March 2014, Casals & Associates, a DynCorp International company, implemented a technical assistance program to promote accountability and curb corruption in Timor-Leste under the sponsorship of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). DI conducted its anti-corruption work in Timor-Leste in close partnership with the central government and local civil society organizations. Program support included: DI accompanied the local Anti-Corruption Commission (CAC) in its first years of institutional growth by assisting in the design of strategic plans, setting up internal operating procedures and forming cadres of qualified professionals to effectively pursue its mission with corruption investigations, corruption prevention and public outreach and research. To build CAC’s criminal investigations practice, DI designed and implemented a comprehensive training program which covered more than 20 subjects. The program complemented these activities with continued mentoring and on-the-job-training support in connection with investigations dispatched by the Office of the Prosecutor General. In corruption prevention, DI developed reference manuals and coordinated with other state institutions to reduce opportunities for corruption, such as developing single entity for business registration, called SERVE. This included a dialogue with state agencies, bilateral cooperation agencies, and private sector representatives which culminated in the design of a three-year Corruption Prevention Plan. Most importantly, DI nurtured a core group at CAC to undertake similar projects in the future, which would require little to no involvement of external advisors. In cooperation with the National Parliament, DI also provided significant support to revamping anti-money laundering legislation, which was approved unanimously in Parliament on July 12, 2013. The revised law included amendments proposed by DI to streamline the investigation and prosecution of money laundering and associated crimes. DI also advised the Council of Ministers on the creation of a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the entity responsible for assisting law enforcement agencies in fighting money laundering and other financial crimes. One of the key aspects of DI’s anti-corruption work in Timor-Leste was its focus on local ownership and sustainability. DI motivated local counterparts in government and civil society to actively participate in program design and execution. As a result of this approach, the local Anti-Corruption Commission and others are now capable of conducting their main aspects of their mandate with little or no external assistance.",Public
" DynCorp International team members work with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE) to help suppress and control wild land fires, helping save many lives and personal property throughout the state. In a recent incident, the DI CAL FIRE team helped suppress the Hutto fire in Smartsville, Calif. The Hutto fire was like many in Northern California during the summer, burning an estimated 38 acres before being contained by the CAL FIRE team and other fire agencies. DI air tanker pilot Colin Rogers was part of the aerial firefighting team that dropped retardant on the Hutto fire. A family whose home he helped save recently paid him a visit, dropping off small gifts to show their appreciation, including a painting done by a young girl in the family. “Our tanker drops were but one of the many tools that kept her home safe during the Hutto fire,” said Rogers. “The retardant we drop helps to slow the spread of the fires, but the boots on the ground put them out.” Rogers, who has been with the program for 13 years, attributes successes like the one with the Hutto fire to effective team coordination. “We could see the flames just about 13 miles off our runway, so we knew it was critical to get right to work. Through experience and confident leadership, we made a plan, coordinating in a very dynamic environment,” he said. “We were able to see the smoke, 13 miles off the end of the runway, so we knew it was critical to get right to work. The fire environment is a very dynamic environment, but the incident commander and air tactical group supervisor coordinate with each other to devise a plan. Relying on experience and confident leadership, we do what we are trained and hired to do.” “No one on the team does this job for the money,” he commented, “We are mission driven, which is critical for success – we feel it’s what we’re here for.” DynCorp International has worked with CAL FIRE since 2001 helping suppress and control wild land fires in California. As part of the program, DI flies and maintains Grumman S-2T fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft, and fully maintains and services civilian UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots. Operating from across California, aircraft can reach most fires within 20 minutes. The OV-10A aircraft fly over fires, directing the air tankers and helicopters to critical areas for retardant and water drops. The retardant used to slow or retard the spread of a fire is a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum-thickening agent, and a coloring agent. All CAL FIRE Aircraft are strategically located throughout the state at airbases and helicopter bases. During high fire activity, CAL FIRE may move aircraft to better provide statewide air support. The department’s firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft respond to an average of more than 5,600 wild land fires each year. Those fires burn more than 172,000 acres annually.",Public

" DynCorp International senior contracts administrator, Tracy Foster, was recently featured in Search & Employ Magazine, a publication of RecruitMilitary. Foster, a 24-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, currently supports DI’s War Reserve Materiel (WRM) program at the Yorktown, Va., Program Management Office. In the article, Foster describes her journey from the military to her civilian career. She retired from the Air Force as a Chief Master Sergeant and served as a contracting squadron superintendent, gaining valuable experience for her transition to DI. At DI, Foster assists in proposal pricing model development, cost input, proposal preparation, contract administration functions, field personnel coordination and with contract negotiations. She joined the Company in early 2014 and hopes to soon earn her Project Manager Certification as well as Lean Six Sigma certification. When asked if she could give any advice to those transitioning from the military to a civilian career, Foster commented, “Always put forward your absolute best effort into anything you want to achieve and you will be successful. Continued education is a must – military members should maximize use of tuition assistance, so when leaving the military you have the highest level of education possible. Never underestimate how important your military training is, whether it’s technical, leadership, or quality type training, civilian employers value those skills.” “Everything I learned in the military helps me with my new job,” she said. “I spent 24 years striving to improve my technical knowledge, computer abilities, leadership and teamwork skills. All the training, education and life skills I gained while in the Air Force helped me make a smooth transition to DynCorp International.” “DynCorp International is a great place for veterans to work because the culture is one of professionalism and integrity,” Foster said. “DynCorp International has a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct to help guide behaviors and business practices. These company values remind me of the Air Force’s Core Values and I am glad to be working for a company that places emphasis on these high standards. Additionally, DynCorp International recognizes the proven valuable skills former military members bring to the company.” DI partners with U.S. Military Transition Offices, supports the Service Academy Career Conferences (SACCs) and participates in U.S. Chamber of Commerce “Hiring our Heroes” employment events, as a part of the Company’s commitment to hiring veterans.

" DynCorp International team members all over the world are focusing on continuous improvement, introducing the Lean Six Sigma process to DI’s programs in aviation, logistics, operations and maintenance, and training. Since August 2013, Lean Six Sigma training has been incorporated throughout the company, certifying more than 200 new Lean practitioners and more than 200 Lean Six Sigma Green Belts. To achieve DI’s continuous improvement goals, the Operations team created a standardized curriculum and certification methodology for Lean Six Sigma Training. “We all have a responsibility if we are going to successfully introduce and embrace a culture of continuous improvement,” said John Bennett, Continuous Improvement senior director, DynCorp International. “Integrating Lean training helps equip our team members to succeed and better serve our customers.” Initial success has led to DI’s Continuous Improvement team expanding training to support higher levels of certification, past the Green Belt and into Black Belt and Master Black Belt, with an increase in overall training events both in a classroom setting and through virtual learning. “Green Belt project results have already made a positive impact on metrics throughout the Company,” commented Bennett. The Continuous Improvement Team is also launching a toolkit for program managers and DI’s Centers of Excellence to aid them in managing continuous improvement at different levels within the organization. Toolkit topics include setting goals, building competency, executing and sustaining projects and measuring results. “We want to empower our employees to feel confident about constantly seeking better and more efficient ways of doing things. We want to make sure that we measure our activities from the point of view of our customer and that processes, standard procedures and metrics are in place so that we can hold each other accountable to our customers’ expectations,” said Bennett. Lean Six Sigma is the combination of two powerful concepts of Lean – understanding the value stream and removing waste – and Six Sigma – reducing variation and controlling the process. Lean accelerates Six Sigma, delivering greater results than what would typically be achieved by Lean or Six Sigma individually. Combining these two methods gives improvement teams a comprehensive tool set to increase the speed and effectiveness of any process within an organization, resulting in increased revenue, reduced costs and improved collaboration. Lean Six Sigma professionals exist at every level – master black belts, black belts, green belts, and Lean Practitioners – who conduct projects and implement improvements.",Public
" Students at the Alberto Masferrer University (USAM) in San Salvador, El Salvador, recently celebrated the completion of the Promoting an Ethics Culture for University Students (PECUS) program. Faculty professors and coordinators recognized the 150 students involved with certificates at the graduation event. Casals & Associates, a DynCorp International company, worked as an implementing partner of USAID’s Democracy Strengthening Program to design, promote and sponsor the PECUS program. Casals team members worked in conjunction with academic coordinators and professors of higher education institutions to develop the program, which promotes an ethics culture among future graduates by developing the necessary skills and knowledge to become ethical citizens, leaders and professionals. Students who completed the “training for trainers” program learned how to integrate ethics as a component of higher education curricula, contribute through concrete actions and build an ethical culture within Salvadoran youth. The graduates have not only recognized the importance of ethics as a pillar for professional and personal behavior regardless of their fields of performance, but each have also committed to training at least 10 other students on the principles they learned in the PECUS program. “I congratulate all PECUS graduates for this important accomplishment, as ethics and values play a fundamental role in the responsible transformation we are seeking for our people, for our country,” said USAM principal, Dr. César Augusto Calderón. “I encourage you all to strive for your dreams and to succeed in your personal journeys holding tight to ethical principles.” During the five month training period, students met every Friday afternoon for presentations from   experts in different areas of ethics in the five module course. Topics included ethics technology and social networks, ethics for life, ethics in the professional field, public ethics and business ethics. “I have learned many valuable things during this course, but the most important is that ethics is a way of life, a style for living.  If we all contribute with our good work and appropriate behavior, aspiring for a state of ethics for our society is possible!” said Oswaldo Alarcón, student, Universidad Dr. José Matías Delgado.",Public
" DynCorp International team members at Fort Bliss, Texas, recently celebrated a safety milestone – working more than 100 days without an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable incident. Through a comprehensive safety program involving all team members and subcontractors, the DI team worked together to accomplish this goal. Each week, team members focused on different safety topics and completed refresher training on each. Topics included preventative safety measures, use of protective gear, chemical storage, fire plans, heat injuries and hazardous materials. For example, when focusing on heat-related injuries, safety flyers were placed in visible locations to highlight heat injury prevention, heat exhaustion, sunburn prevention, and cause and symptoms of heat stroke and heat cramps. Awareness training also reinforced each topic. Management of monthly audits were also increased and a weekly “safety scoreboard” kept team members on track. “Focusing on safety is a priority for the Fort Bliss team, and keeping our team members aware of safety procedures helps prevent incidents – allowing us to better serve our customer,” said Timothy Gahr, DynCorp International program manager. DI supports the U.S. Army at Fort Bliss through task order under the Field and Installation Readiness Support (FIRST) contract to manage the Field Logistics Readiness Center (FLRC).

" DynCorp International team members in Afghanistan recently graduated four Afghanistan Air Force personnel trained to maintain MD530F aircraft. They are the first to complete the first of three levels training and will perform maintenance on the active helicopter fleet, working hand-in-hand with the DI Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) team. “This is a critical step for the Afghan Maintenance Command in eventually having an autonomous team of MD530F fleet mechanics. We believe these graduates are committed to continuing training as well as setting a positive example for future Afghan Air Force personnel to follow in their footsteps,” said Noel Shorts, DynCorp International program manager. DI’s team of aircraft maintenance trainers provide three levels of training – apprentice, journeyman and craftsman. The course curriculum for each level is comprised of classroom academics, hands-on practical exercises, written and oral exams. Upon completion of the level one training, personnel are able to operate independently, show demonstrated practical knowledge to operate without supervision. Additionally, graduates are able to teach the material and provide guidance on the correct courses of action and the associated costs and benefits. “Our strong partnership with the Afghan Air Force personnel was definitely the key to success on this program and integral in the graduation of the first aircraft mechanics able to help maintain the fleet independent of our instructor,” said Shorts. “We worked together as a team to make it happen.” Through the MD530F CLS program, DI serves as a subcontractor to MD Helicopters, Inc. to provide aviation maintenance support for the Afghan Rotary Wing Flight Training Program. DI’s DynAviation Group supports aviation missions at more than 100 locations worldwide – including hostile and austere locations – maintaining the highest level of operational readiness at all times. DI team members ensure safe, reliable and expertly-maintained aircraft are available for customers’ needs. The Rotary Wing Flight Training Program was developed by the U.S. Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization for the Afghan Air Corps in order to create an independent Afghan Air Force program. DI has supported this program since September 2011.",Public
" DynCorp International is ranked 10th in the 2014 Washington Technology Top 100, a list of the largest contractors in the government market according to their IT, systems integration, telecom, professional services and other high-tech revenue. Last year, DI was ranked 11. In 2013, DI restructured into three strategic business groups: DynAviation, DynLogistics and DynGlobal. The DynAviation Group provides full-spectrum aerospace, aviation and air operations solutions worldwide, while the DynLogistics Group provides total support solutions including conventional and contingency logistics; operations and maintenance support; platform modification and upgrades; supply chain management; training, security and full spectrum intelligence mission support services. The DynGlobal Group focuses on opportunities to deliver DI’s vast array of capabilities to foreign governments and other international customers. DI had several key contract wins in 2013, contributing to a successful year. Within the DynAviation Group, DI was awarded the Regional Aviation Sustainment Maintenance – West Region (RASM-W), under the Army Field Maintenance (AFM) contract, valued at up to $388.5 million and a Contract Field Teams (CFT) program task order to support the U.S. Navy at Solomons, Md., valued at up to $27 million. The DynAviation team also formed a strategic alliance with Sierra Nevada Corporation’s (SNC) Integrated Mission Systems (IMS) to provide aviation maintenance support, leading to a new subcontract award to provide contractor logistics support in Afghanistan under the Multi Sensor Aerial Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (MAISR) Operations and Sustainment program. In the DynLogistics Group, key contract wins included a Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) contract to provide logistics support for the agency’s equipment in Afghanistan and a new award to support the U.S. Army – Total Package Fielding (TPF) for the family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (MTVs). DI chairman and CEO, Steven Gaffney, credits DI’s stability to the Company’s continued focus on core competencies. “Stay with what works,” Gaffney said in an interview with Washington Technology. “Stick with your core offerings and do it in a different manner for different customers.” He also commented on DI’s intentional culture which includes a tenet on helping “Create the Future,” keeping team members looking ahead in terms of business success. “In fiscal 2013, all the things we thought could happen did happen,” he said. “In years like this, the question becomes, ‘How do you read the tea leaves early enough to get ahead of the competition?’” “We’ve spent the last four years, building a values-based culture at DynCorp International,” Gaffney added. Those values include a focus on the future, not the moment.”",Public
" On the heels of National Cancer Survivors Day, celebrated annually on the first Sunday of June, DynCorp International team members in McLean, Va., supported the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) by hosting a fundraiser bake sale and food truck lunch with partner, Fava Pot food truck.

" DynCorp International chairman and chief executive officer, Steven Gaffney, discussed the role of service contractors as part of the Atlantic Council Captains of Industry series. Tying in with the observance of the Memorial Day holiday, Gaffney described the sacrifice that contractors also make while serving missions around the world. “We all are familiar with and stand in awe of those who dedicate their lives to military service, but there is another group of individuals who serve as well,” said Gaffney. “Even though their service and sacrifice have become an accepted part of the mission cadence of U.S. government contracting industry, unfortunately their service and sacrifice is far less celebrated.” DI team members serve all over the world, supporting programs in aviation, logistics, training, intelligence and operational solutions. Gaffney described their roles as pilots helping fight wildfires from the sky, and as aviation maintenance specialists servicing the aircraft that carry the top elected officials of the United States.” “Memorial Day is a bit different for us at DI and many of our colleagues in the contractor community. On Memorial Day I know I’ll be thinking not only about the brave men and women of our military who serve and paid the ultimate price, but also about contractors who lost their lives while serving as well,” said Gaffney. “I thank all of them for their service and sacrifice.” To date, 71 DI team members have lost their lives supporting U.S. government and ally country missions. To honor these colleagues, a memorial wall with each team member’s name has been installed at DI’s new global headquarters building in McLean, Va. The Atlantic Council promotes constructive leadership and engagement in international affairs based on the central role of the Atlantic Community in meeting global challenges. Founded in 1961, the Council provides an essential forum for navigating the dramatic shifts in economic and political influence that are shaping the twenty-first century by educating and galvanizing its uniquely influential, nonpartisan network of international political, business, and intellectual leaders.

"  The DynCorp International team at Solomons, Md., is helping upgrade a P-25 shipboard fire truck, a self-propelled vehicle designed for flight-deck use, at the U.S. Navy’s Fleet Readiness Center. DI team members are working hand-in-hand with Fleet Readiness Center — Aviation Support Equipment personnel and Naval Air Systems Command’s (NAVAIR) Common Aviation Support Equipment Program Office (PMA-260). Upgrades include more powerful engines and pumps as part of the Conversion in Lieu of Procurement (CILOP), where existing equipment is refurbished with new parts as opposed to building a new vehicle, ultimately resulting in significant cost savings. “It saves the Navy time and money,” said Paul Scatko, project lead engineer. “We don’t have to procure a whole new truck and it is a lot less expensive to just revamp the one we have.” The upgraded fire truck will be used on aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships and will play an essential role in keeping flight operations on schedule in the case a fire occurs on board a flight deck. “We have done the depot overhaul on these units for many years,” said Tony Garcia, DynCorp International project manager. “Now we are working with the engineers to build and validate the new design during the CILOP.” “We have performed CILOP on various pieces of equipment for the Navy and we are proud of the variety of support services we are able to provide at Solomons Island,” Garcia continued. DI was awarded a new task order under the Contract Field Teams (CFT) program to continue providing support at Solomons in November 2013.

" For the third year in a row, DynCorp International (DI) has earned a 2014 Champions of Veteran Enterprise Award from the National Veteran Small Business Coalition (NVSBC). Federal agencies and prime contractors that meet or exceed the three percent goal of providing opportunities to veteran-owned (VOSB) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) are being recognized for this honor. DI far exceeded the stated target, with 16.7% to VOSB suppliers. Additionally, organizations that have gone above and beyond to make their acquisition process veteran-friendly or took significant actions to increase contracting or subcontracting opportunities will also be recognized. “We are proud to partner with veteran small business owners,” said Steve Gaffney, chairman and chief executive officer. “The Company was founded by veterans more than 60 years ago and we continue to share the same sense of service and values. Businesses that are owned and led by veterans have proven to be invaluable partners as we work to support national security and foreign policy objectives around the world.” The award will be presented during the Champions of Veteran Enterprise Awards luncheon at the 2014 Veteran Entrepreneur Training Symposium (VETS), Tuesday, June 17, 2014, in Reno, Nev. NVSBC’s mission is to transition veterans into business owners servicing the federal government. Their vision is to ensure that veteran businesses are given first consideration for federal prime and subcontracting procurement opportunities. VETS brings together federal agencies, prime contractors, and veterans to network and discuss how to take full advantage of the federally mandated contracting opportunities set aside for veteran-owned small businesses. For more than 20 years, various veteran small business groups have achieved success in advocating for veterans to be seen as a viable force in the Federal government acquisition landscape. Beginning with the enactment of Public Law 106-50 in 1998, the nation began to understand the earned benefit of honorable military service and veterans continuing to serve their nation through entrepreneurship and selling goods and services to the federal government. VETS provides a platform for all stakeholders to get closer to these goals and support our veteran small businesses.",Public
" DynCorp International team members working in support of NASA are participating in an innovative training program designed to teach astronauts basic aircraft maintenance skills for use on long duration space missions on the International Space Station (ISS). DI aviation mechanics worked in partnership with U.S. Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) and NASA astronauts to develop the concepts and methods necessary for the aerospace vehicle and systems maintenance training program. As part of the ISS Field Maintenance Training program, trainees perform aviation maintenance tasks for an average of 30 to 35 hours per week, rotating for a week each on the hangar floor, specialty shops (engine, sheet metal, hydraulics), and avionics shop. Their focus includes performing mechanical, hydraulic and electrical repair actions on NASA T-38 aircraft and equipment, under close supervision by many of DI’s most experienced and knowledgeable mechanics. Throughout the program, astronaut trainees are exposed to numerous repair tasks directly applicable to those needed by crews on the ISS. “Very few aircraft mechanics in the world will ever have this opportunity,” said Jim Snowden, DynCorp International executive program manager. “Our team members feel much more connected to ISS missions and will be watching the results of their contributions in action as ‘their’ astronauts live and work 250 miles above the earth.” Snowden also cited several additional advantages of this collaborative program. “The mechanics, in addition to their exceptional technical breadth and depth, possess terrific communication skills to help impart their knowledge. The proximity of Ellington Field to the Johnson Space Center main campus keeps training expenses low. The trainees worked on flight-certified equipment and they performed actual repairs on actual aircraft – not mock-ups or other low fidelity substitutes. Additionally there is a very high degree of similarity between certain ISS systems and jet aircraft system designs and functions.” The astronaut syllabi, until recently, provided fewer than 40 hours of maintenance training during the intense two and a half years or more of astronaut preparation before their missions to the ISS. Originally, equipment on orbit was intended to be removed and replaced in the event of failure. The Space Shuttle had the capacity to reliably deliver large replacement units and return the faulty equipment to Earth. However, with the end of the Space Shuttle era, ISS partners recognize that their repair capability and capacity must extend more deeply into the Station systems, components and sub elements. Not all astronauts necessarily have backgrounds that include hands-on mechanical, electrical or tool-use aptitudes. Therefore, the opportunity to provide hands-on instruction with wide variety of common or specialized tools was valuable, as is the verbal instruction about tool use, troubleshooting concepts, technical data and safety.",Public
" When a fellow DynCorp International team member was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in late 2013, DI team members in McLean, Va., wanted to take action.

Riggs, a DynCorp International market strategy director, was also in attendance the day of the race as her family joined the team during the 5K. “It was a really inspiring event and we were so happy to be part of it!” commented Timmer. “Having Kathy and her family join us at the event made our contribution that much more meaningful.” DI team members surpassed their goal of raising $5,000 with the team’s individual donations being matched with a corporate donation. The 2014 Tidewater PurpleStride 5K took place April 5 at the Virginia Beach 31st Street Park, in Virginia Beach, Va., hosted by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network’s Tidewater affiliate. The event raised a total of more than $140,000. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is a nationwide network of people dedicated to working together to advance research, support patients and create hope for those affected by pancreatic cancer. Founded in 1999, the non-profit Pancreatic Cancer Action Network’s national office is in Manhattan Beach, Calif., with offices in Washington, D.C., and volunteer leadership in more than 90 communities around the country. An estimated 46,000 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year, though research on this type of cancer has been historically underfunded. Only approximately two percent of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) budget is allocated towards this research, which could help find new cures and improve survival rates. Donations from events like the Tidewater PurpleStride 5K help to change these dismal statistics by funding research grants, advocacy efforts, patient support, and awareness activities coordinated by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.",Public
" As a long-time supporter of the American University of Afghanistan, DynCorp International supported the third annual Friends of the American University of Afghanistan (AUAF) benefit dinner on April 28, 2014. DI team members joined two former U.S. Ambassadors to Afghanistan – Ron Neumann and Ryan Crocker, two Afghan Ambassadors to the U.S. – Said Jawad and Eklil Hakkimi, along with many other supporters of the American University of Afghanistan, at the event. The event’s speakers discussed the promising youth of Afghanistan, especially those with college degrees, that will play an integral part in the country’s future success. Given more opportunities to receive an education at institutions at AUAF, with an almost 50% female enrollment, are vital to the Afghan people. DI is also a proud sponsor of AUAF’s International Campus, and last year its soccer field was named the DynCorp International field. The field is used by the university’s men’s and women’s soccer teams, as well as by the International School of Kabul and several Kabul area orphanages. Regarded as one of the finest soccer fields in the region, the Afghan national team has also utilized the grounds. In October 2012, the field was the site of the first intercollegiate soccer tournament involving six teams from Kabul area universities. The American University of Afghanistan is Afghanistan’s only private, not-for-profit, non-partisan and co-educational university. It opened its doors in 2006 with an initial enrollment of 50 students, and today enrolls more than 1,700 full and part-time students. It has produced 29 Fulbright Scholars and maintains partnerships with the world’s most prestigious universities, including Stanford University, Georgetown University, and the University of California network. AUAF offers undergraduate degree programs in business, English, information technology, math and science and political science and public administration. AUAF also offers a Master’s program in business administration. AUAF’s mission is to provide world class higher education that prepares leaders to meet the needs of Afghanistan and the region. AUAF operates from a spacious, five-acre campus equipped with up-to-date facilities and technical capacity.",Public
" DynCorp International embedded police mentors Timothy Branch and Gregory Franklin were recently awarded the Medal of Honor from the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior for the outstanding mentoring and training they provided over the years at the Afghan National Civil Order Police (ANCOP) headquarters. With their leadership, ANCOP headquarters operations responsibilities were fully turned over to ANCOP personnel. “One of the initial goals of this program was to mentor and train the Afghan Police so that their leadership could eventually take over planning, supporting and staffing of their own programs and be successful.  As our teams draw down, mentors should take pride in knowing they made a major difference,” said Darrel Saxton, DynCorp International program support manager. Branch began working at the ANCOP headquarters in May 2011. His initial role as a mentor was to assist in standing up an additional ANCOP brigade by mentoring Afghan colonels on inventory and accountability. Over time, the ANCOP personnel he mentored raised their capability milestone rating, and became less dependent on his assistance, which allowed for more focus on operations training. Franklin came to the program as a subject matter expert to mentor the ANCOP logistics department. He was responsible for overseeing logistical requirements for seven brigades and ANCOP headquarters with approximately 16,000 deployable law enforcement officers. By February 2014, the ANCOP personnel were operating autonomously without the supervision of mentors and had reached the highest capability milestone rating of 1-A. “It has been a great honor to work at ANCOP headquarters,” commented Branch. “During my two years with ANCOP, I formed a strong bond of professional friendship with my Afghan counterparts. We faced each logistical challenge as a team with one mind and one focus – shoulder to shoulder,” said Franklin. He continues, “The success at ANCOP headquarters can be attributed to the efforts of an ensemble cast of Afghan partners and Coalition Force team members. As a team, we worked to build the ANCOP organization into a model force.  I’m honored to receive this award and will cherish the memories of working with DynCorp International and serving the people of Afghanistan.” Through the Afghanistan National Police/Ministry of Interior Development Program (AMDP), DI provides executive level mentoring, instructor training and certification, field training, and logistics across Afghanistan. DI executive mentors coach senior Afghan officials with a focus on leadership, management and ethical decision-making skills, and have mentored leaders at the Ministerial level.",Public
" DynCorp International (DI) today announced that the DI family of companies has hired nearly 10,000 veterans since it began participating in the White House Joining Forces initiative. Joining Forces celebrates its third anniversary in 2014, an initiative launched by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden to help connect U.S. servicemen and women, veterans and military spouses with the resources they need to find jobs at home. In 2013, the DI family of companies hired more than 2,000 veterans and has hired more than 9,725 veterans since it has been involved with the Joining Forces campaign. “Our veteran workforce strengthens our capability to successfully serve our customers on programs around the world,” said Steve Gaffney, chairman and chief executive officer of DynCorp International. “Their experience and dedication are true assets and we have set a goal to hire an additional 1,000 veterans in 2014.” Even before participating in the Joining Forces program in 2011, DI has had a longstanding commitment to hiring veterans. DI partners with U.S. Military Transition Offices, supports the Service Academy Career Conferences (SACCs) and participates in U.S. Chamber of Commerce “Hiring our Heroes” employment events. In 2014 alone, DI has already been recognized on Victory Media’s Top Military-Friendly Employers list, Military Times’s 2014 list of “Best for Vets” employers and Vetrepreneur Magazine’s best defense companies for veteran-owned businesses.

Joining Forces is a national initiative to engage all sectors of society to give service members and their families the opportunities and support they have earned. Since the first days of the Administration, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden have met with military families, learned about their successes and challenges, and made it their priority to support them. Joining Forces creates opportunities for all Americans to step up and show their gratitude to our service members and their families. Through this effort, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Biden are asking Americans to do more for those who have done so much for us. They are asking Americans to get involved in any way they can.",Public
" The DynCorp International (DI) team working in support of NASA at Johnson Space Center (JSC) was awarded the Contractor Safety & Health Forum (CSF)’s Safety & Health Excellence Award. The recognition was awarded in March 2014 by the NASA JSC Contractor Affairs Safety Committee.

Each candidate company submitted their respective application with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) incidence rate safety data; management and employee participation level in JSC safety events; and a description of their safety best practices, safety innovations and service to the JSC community. The information submitted was evaluated and scored by an awards committee consisting of contractor representatives. The committee reviewed the submissions to determine if the candidates met the required criteria. The award included recognition for the Company’s successful effort in working with NASA to mitigate risk of injury by installing a cargo lift alongside a steep staircase so heavy items can be safely transported by machine. “Teamwork and safety awareness prevailed to create a safer workplace,” commented Jim Snowden, DynCorp International program manager. DI has worked with NASA since June 2012, providing support services for flight operations, maintenance, repairs and alterations to aircraft, component parts and support equipment and engineering services.

" DynCorp International (DI) has been recognized as a top veteran employer by Military Times for the third year in a row. “Nearly 70 percent of our 2013 hires were former military personnel,” said Steve Gaffney, DynCorp International chairman and chief executive officer. “Their experience tracks well with the experience needed in many of our programs, and the values that they carried with them throughout their military careers help reinforce the values-based culture that sets DI apart from other companies.” Military Times focused on culture and policies that cater to military veterans when conducting and scoring the fifth annual Best for Vets: Employers survey, a nearly 90-question analysis of a company’s efforts to connect with veterans and provide an environment for success. Rankings were developed based on the answers that companies provided to questions about their recruiting of people connected to the military; company policies related to veterans, reservists and their families; and the organization’s culture. Veterans bring invaluable experience and dedication to DI’s business as employees, business partners and suppliers. A participant in the Joining Forces initiative, DI’s commitment to recruiting and hiring veterans have earned the Company several accolades throughout the years. DI has been selected by Victory Media as one of the nation’s Top 100 Military-Friendly Employers® for seven years in a row, placing 18th for 2014.

" DynCorp International has been awarded a task order under the Logistics Worldwide (LOGWORLD) multiple award contract from the General Services Administration (GSA) to provide engineering support services as part of the Storage, Analysis, Failure evaluation, and Reclamation (SAFR) Program at the Corpus Christi Army Depot. “The DI team has successfully performed on this program since 1989, providing the highest level of support to maintenance program and item managers at the Aviation and Missile Command Logistics Center and the Corpus Christi Army Depot,” said Jim Myles, DynCorp International senior vice president, DynAviation. DI team members will support the aviation repair maintenance process through the collection, warehousing, inspection fault-data collection, remediation engineering failure analysis, engineering repair development, and reclamation of supply parts for repair development dispositions. The competitively-awarded task order has one base year with four, one-year options, and a total potential value of $5 million.  The Storage, Analysis, Failure evaluation, and Reclamation (SAFR) Program was developed by the Aviation and Missile Command and the Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center faced an increase in parts demands for T700 engine blades. After consulting with the Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC), their solution was to ship more than 1,500 reparable turbine blades to the Corpus Christi T700 engine maintenance program for inspection, repair and return to service in accordance with T700 Depot Maintenance Work Requirements and Maintenance Engineering Call guidance. Their solution not only solved the engine parts demand issue, but also resulted in a large cost savings for the U.S. Army. According to Mark A. Velazquez, chief engineer of the SAFR program, “The program collects ‘select mission essential’ candidate parts that are rejected from maintenance programs that no longer meet current maintenance repair or program criteria to support engineering damage tolerance relief analysis, repair development and parts reclamation.” DI team members have worked with the SAFR program at the Corpus Christi Army Depot for nearly 25 years and were recognized for their exemplary service in 2012 with an AAA award.",Public
" DynCorp International is again a proud sponsor of the “In their Shoes” 5K Fun Run/Walk to benefit the Iraqi Children Foundation (ICF). The event will be held May 10, 2014, at Cameron Run Regional Park in Alexandria, Va. All funds raised through the event will directly impact ICF’s goal to raise $50,000 for food, tutoring, and emotional care for desperately poor and vulnerable orphans and street children in Iraq. According to a December 2012 UNICEF report, Iraq is experiencing an urgent orphan crisis and estimates the number of orphans in Iraq today at 800,000. Street children are also estimated in the thousands. These children are dangerously vulnerable to recruitment and exploitation by criminals or terrorists, as well as physical abuse, human trafficking, and other risks, making ICF’s mission all the more critical. The Iraqi Children Foundation (formerly Sponsor Iraqi Children Foundation) is an independent, nonsectarian, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) charity that is committed to providing loving care to the most vulnerable of Iraq’s orphans and street children. ICF funds a special safe haven where 120 children received care last year, including nutritious meals, tutoring, health care, art and recreation, and other services.  In 2012, ICF took child trauma experts from the award-winning Children’s Village of NY to Baghdad to train Iraqi caregivers in creative tools to address children trauma.

" More than 20 DynCorp International team members and family members formed a “Run and Remember” team for the Rock and Roll Half Marathon that took place March 23, 2014, in Dallas, Texas. Run and Remember teams pay tribute to America’s fallen heroes in support of the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), and help raise funds that directly benefit TAPS’s program. The DI team, DI Stars, raised nearly $8,000 through this event. DynCorp International Supply Chain director, Billy Harlin, singlehandedly raised $1,645 towards the team total! The DI Stars team also chose to run in memory of their fallen colleagues, wearing shirts with photos of each DI team member who lost their life while serving on a DI program in the last five years. “TAPS has provided such great support to the family members of many of our fellow team members over the years,” commented Elaine Kinnee, DynCorp International Employee Assistance Program (EAP) coordinator. “We were proud to be able to honor our colleagues and raise funds so others could benefit from TAPS’s great programs.” Hundreds of people every year run (or walk) at races throughout the country to remember and honor our fallen service members and raise funds to help TAPS assist the families left behind. TAPS Run & Remember Team events are held throughout the country, where TAPS has an organized team in the race. Depending on the race length and format, teams may include children, surviving families of the fallen, and just ordinary citizens who want to honor the fallen and care for their families. Team members have online fundraising web pages where they can ask friends and others to contribute to support their run, share why they are running, and offer information about who they are running for. The funds raised through Run and Remember events flow directly into TAPS programming which supports families who have been impacted by a death in the military or as a contractor through an amazing network of resources, seminars and publications. TAPS provides these services at no charge to survivors from all branches of the service, including Reserves and National Guard. TAPS’ programs and services are available not only for immediate family, but also for extended family and friends. Also in March 2014, DI and TAPS established a formal agreement – TAPS’s first with a private company – to provide survivors of DI employees comfort and care through comprehensive services and programs including peer-based emotional support, case work assistance, connections to community-based care, and grief and trauma resources.",Public
" The U.S. Air Force has awarded DynCorp International (DI) a task order under the Contract Field Teams (CFT) contract to provide aviation maintenance support to the 512th Airlift Wing at Dover Air Force Base. “The DI team will provide our superior intermediate level engine overhaul services on one of the largest military aircraft ever built,” said Jim Myles, DynCorp International senior vice president, DynAviation. DI will provide jet engine intermediate maintenance support and component repair for the Air Force Air Mobility Command, Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard C-5 aircraft. The competitively-awarded task order has one base year with one, one-year option, and a total potential value of $8.5 million. Dover Air Force Base is located in Delaware at the center of the Delmarva (Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia) peninsula. Dover AFB is home to the 436th Airlift Wing, known as the “Eagle Wing” and the 512th Airlift Wing, our Air Force Reserve associate–referred to as the “Liberty Wing.” Together, these two wings make up the “Dover Team.” The 512th Airlift Wing is the only Air Force Reserve unit in Delaware and has 1,870 reservists. Members of the 512th work side-by-side their active duty counterparts in the 436th Airlift Wing. Dover AFB operates the largest and busiest air freight terminal in the Department of Defense and is also home to the Air Mobility Command Museum, which welcomes thousands of visitors each year. The Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs is the DOD’s largest joint-service mortuary facility and the only one located in the continental United States. The C-5 Galaxy is one of the largest aircraft in the world and the largest airlifter in the Air Force inventory. The aircraft can carry a fully equipped combat-ready military unit to any point in the world on short notice and then provide the supplies required to help sustain the fighting force. The C-5 has a greater capacity than any other airlifter. It has the ability to carry 36 standard pallets and 81 troops simultaneously. The Galaxy is also capable of carrying any of the Army’s air-transportable combat equipment. It can also carry outsize and oversize cargo over intercontinental ranges and can take off or land in relatively short distances. Ground crews are able to load and off-load the C-5 simultaneously at the front and rear cargo openings, reducing cargo transfer times.",Public
" Several DynCorp International team members participated in a head-shaving event to raise funds for St. Baldrick’s Foundation, which supports childhood cancer research. The DI team took part in a local event held at The Avenue Viera in Viera, Fla., on March 15, 2014, and raised a total of $2,500. Five DI team members volunteered to have their heads shaved to support nine-year-old Matthew S., of Palm Bay, Fla., who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in November 2010. “We chose to support St. Baldrick’s as childhood cancer has impacted the lives of many of our fellow team members, family and friends,” said Joseph Balser, DynCorp International manager, IT Business Systems & Development. Jorge Camacho, DynCorp International quality control inspector, said, “I haven’t shaved my head since I joined the military 38 years ago. Shaving it to raise funds for childhood cancer research was most comforting, thinking that I could help save a young life.” “The generosity displayed by the DynCorp International Team and the St. Baldrick’s Foundation amazes me,” commented Stephen Shillingsburg, IT systems analyst, DynCorp International. “Having a personal link to childhood cancer brings certain imbedded knowledge with that connection. My sincerest appreciation goes to all whom have participated directly and indirectly in this worthy cause.” St. Baldrick’s head-shaving events began as a challenge between businessmen and have grown from one event in 2000 to more than 1,300 events in 2012, raising critical funds for childhood cancer research. Because children with cancer often lose their hair during treatment, “shavees” for the St. Baldrick’s Foundation show their support by shaving their heads voluntarily, standing proudly bald beside them. The true goal of head-shaving events is to inspire friends and family to donate to the cure for childhood cancer, raising funds for lifesaving childhood cancer research. “Shavees” sign up on the website, collect money from friends and family much like a walk-a-thon, then participate at a volunteer-organized event in their community to take their turn in the barber’s chair. More than $25 million has already been raised through these events in 2014. The St. Baldrick’s Foundation is a volunteer-driven charity dedicated to raising money for life-saving childhood cancer research and funds more in childhood cancer grants than any organization except for the U.S. government. Since the Foundation’s first grants as an independent charity in 2005, St. Baldrick’s has funded more than $127 million to support the most brilliant childhood cancer research experts in the world.",Public
" DynCorp International (DI) embedded police mentors working in support of the Afghanistan National Police/Ministry of Interior Development Program (AMDP) worked with Afghan Uniformed Police (AUP) officers to develop a specialized Training Education Officer Course in Southern Afghanistan. The course was developed to improve field training across the province by providing specialized training to AUP officers in the field. The “train the trainer” course of instruction, by design, provides the AUP training officers and non-commissioned officers a base level of operational training to conduct police operations courses in the field. The course teaches AUP officers how to properly teach the police curriculum, including how to organize, research, and lay out lesson plans. Trainees are also mentored in techniques for addressing groups and documenting students’ progress. “Through this specialized course we are able to equip the Afghan police who have been trained by DI’s embedded police mentors to pass on their knowledge to Afghan police recruits in the field,” said Robert Rahn, DynCorp International Program Support Coordinator. “We cover all topics from developing budgets to operating and managing training centers to help the AUP eventually become self-sustaining.” A number of non-commissioned officers and officers from throughout Kandahar participated in the inaugural one-week session. Once completed, course graduates received a certification for excellence in training for field operations. “This ‘train the trainer’ course epitomizes the exact goal of the AMDP program. We’ve seen the AUP take ownership of their training and successfully apply what they’ve learned in the field,” said Robert Rahn. “The DI AMDP team takes pride in being able to support the AUP’s long-term success.” One DynCorp International embedded police mentor commented, “The Afghan trainers taught the class in a highly proficient and professional manner.  We saw the class evolve into a training effort that would be adopted by the Afghans and continued in future training across the province.” Under the AMDP program, DI provides executive level mentoring, instructor training and certification, field training, and logistics across Afghanistan. DI executive mentors coach senior Afghan officials with a focus on leadership, management and ethical decision-making skills, and have mentored leaders at the Ministerial level. DI trainers teach and certify Afghan police instructors in a “train-the-trainer” program, conducting most training hands-on for hundreds of Afghan instructors who are responsible for tens of thousands of Afghan National Police. With a cadre of skilled Afghan trainers in place, when Coalition trainers leave Afghanistan an enduring training capability remains. Training topics include: basic training, border training, advanced police training, special police training (SWAT), criminal investigations, staff officer training and curriculum development. DI trainers also teach and evaluate Afghan police units on their field operations by visiting locations throughout Afghanistan.",Public
" DynCorp International was a proud sponsor of the 2014 Taste of the South held March 29, 2014, at the Washington Hilton in Washington, DC. DI sponsored the state of Texas, directly benefitting the Comfort Crew for Military Kids. The Comfort Crew is a non-profit organization that supports military children through programs that combine customized in-person live experiences, animated DVD’s, guided journals, and an online web-portal to help them through the unique situations they experience as a military child. Each Comfort Crew piece uses a unique blend of humor and personal stories to open kids up to talking about serious subjects in a way that is accessible to children. Comfort Crew has assisted more than 100,000 children in just the past two years. The Taste of the South (TOTS) was founded in 1982 by southerners who had relocated to Washington, D.C., from Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.  Wanting to share their traditions with new friends as well as each other, the group held their first party for $15 a ticket and then donated the proceeds to a southern-based charity. Donations grew year after year, and even during tough economic times the group was able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to give away. In 2003, TOTS created the “Dixie Fund” to earmark funds from the annual event toward the charity of choice of one of its member states. This year’s featured charity is West End School in Louisville, Kentucky. West End School provides a free, private college-prep education for at-risk young men in the community from pre-K to 8th grade. West End School, which opened its doors in 2005, provides an alternative form of education for such at-risk students. West End School, which is run primarily by volunteers, creates a culture of high expectations for its students, which has led to the success of the School as well as its graduates.",Public
" The 800 DynCorp International teammates working in support of the Philippines Operations Support (POS) contract are celebrating a safety milestone. They surpassed ten million hours without a single Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recordable event – a momentous record earned over the course of eight years. Steve McKeon, DynCorp International Environmental Health and Safety director states, “This is one of the most amazing records I have seen in defense contracting – from visiting the program, I can tell they are very serious about safety.” DI’s POS contract provides air, land, and sea logistics, transport, camp operations, food service, billeting, potable water, field sanitation, utilities, hazardous material collection and disposal, MWR, property security, and vector control to the U.S. Department of Defense. “There are many factors behind good safety performance,” DynCorp International program director, Ronnie Stokes, states, “but a key element at POS is their application of behavioral safety principles – each employee owns their safety performance and protects their team mates as well. They look out for customer and visitor safety so no one gets hurt.” Safe behavior is noted and recognized by managers on the POS contract as a part of their “Safety Pays” campaign to give recognition to the best safety performers each quarter. DI’s POS personnel were given custom t-shirts in appreciation for their commitment to safety and held award celebrations at their local sites.",Public
" DynCorp International has announced that it is planning a major expansion in the United Kingdom. DI has a broad history operating globally, providing highly complex logistics, fleet management and through-life supply chain solutions. Based in London, DynCorp International (UK) has been established as a new company pursuing opportunities in Europe and Africa. DI operates more than 100 programmes worldwide, including the maintenance of the air wing that transports U.S. political leaders. Additionally, at the peak of its Afghanistan commitment, DI had 19,000 people maintaining vehicles used by coalition forces; organizing road and air movement of equipment; providing facilities on military bases; and training and mentoring Afghan military and government personnel.  Wider global operations include aerial firefighting of wildfires and support to disaster and emergency relief. Announcing the move during a program of launch events in London, DI president Chris Bernhardt set two priorities for the UK: “First, we already maintain some 200 types of aircraft and 80 types of military vehicles at more than 100 locations around the world, so we will focus on opportunities to use this experience in the UK. Secondly, we will capitalise on our long record of building and operating facilities both in home base areas and in hazardous locations overseas.” Major General Ian Copeland, who left the British Army earlier this year, has been appointed as the Company’s first UK Managing Director.

" Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc., the parent of DynCorp International Inc., a global services provider, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results. DI’s fourth quarter revenue was $711.8 million, compared with fourth quarter 2012 revenue of $1,025.8 million, with the decrease primarily driven by reduced needs in Iraq and Afghanistan. For the full year 2013, the Company reported revenue of $3.3 billion, compared with $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced service needs in Iraq, affecting both the Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Air Wing (“INL Air Wing”) and Worldwide Protective Services (“WPS”) contracts; the accelerated pace of the drawdown in Afghanistan, which impacted the demand for services under the Company’s Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (“LOGCAP IV”) contract and caused reduced training needs under the Afghanistan Ministry of Defense Program (“AMDP”) contract; fewer new contract wins and the delay in business awards caused by the U.S. budget uncertainty and sequestration. Net loss attributable to Holdings was $253.7 million for 2013, an increase of $244.8 million from the net loss attributable to Holdings reported in 2012, with the decline driven primarily by the factors discussed above and the impact of a charge related to a contract dispute that occurred in the third quarter of 2013. “Despite prolonged delays in new business awards, sequestration and the first U.S. government shutdown in 17 years, the team was still able to hold our win rates constant, identify and deliver cost efficiencies, and continue to delight our customers,” said Steve Gaffney, DynCorp International chairman and chief executive officer. “We expected to feel the impact of op-tempo changes in Afghanistan – and we did – but held our focus on quality service, and continuing to develop the new commercial leg of our business.” Full year 2013 highlights include:  ",Public

" DynCorp International human resources Employee Assistance Program (EAP) vice president, Mike Warren, recently presented the family of Kevin Davis, former DI employee, with a Defense of Freedom Medal. Davis was working at Kandahar Air Field in Afghanistan when a rocket attack on December 25, 2010 took his life. Davis was a warehouseman working in support of the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) IV and had been on assignment there for only three months at the time of the attack. Although several years have now passed, his contributions have not been forgotten and he was nominated and approved to receive the Defense of Freedom Medal, a medal created by the Secretary of Defense in 2001 to honor civilian personnel injured or killed in the line of duty. It is the civilian equivalent of the military order of the Purple Heart. At the family’s request, the DOFM was presented to Kevin’s family at their 2013 Christmas family gathering. Kevin’s mother, Francis Murray, accepted the award on her son’s behalf. Approximately 20 family members were in attendance, including Davis’s four children: Jauniece, 23, Kennedi, 15, MiKayla, 11; and Ashley, 9. He was only with the team for a short time, but his impact was deep. His coworkers described a man “any manager would dream of having on their team.” One friend said, “For those of us here who knew Kevin outside of work, we knew him to be kind, honest and a man of great honor and quiet strength.” The impact that he had on others clearly went beyond his colleagues and friends at work when, halfway around the world, in his hometown of Houston, Texas, more than 450 friends and family gathered for the service to celebrate his life. The Secretary of Defense Medal for the Defense of Freedom was established to acknowledge civilian employees of the Department of Defense (DoD) who are killed or wounded in the line of duty. The medal symbolizes the extraordinary fidelity and essential service of the Department’s civilian workforce who are an integral part of the DoD and who contribute to the preservation of national security. Eligibility criteria for the medal are aligned as closely as possible to those for the Purple Heart for members of the Armed Forces; this medal differs from other medals in that it is not “recommended.” The employee is “entitled” to the medal if the employee is eligible and if the following conditions or criteria are present. The medal shall be awarded to employees who are killed or who sustain injury due to hostile action against the U.S., or killed or wounded while rescuing or attempting to rescue any other employee or individual subjected to injuries sustained under such conditions.",Public

Blood donations are in high need during the winter months and donors will be able to directly impact the supply in the local community. The drive also coincides with National Blood Donor Month, which takes place each year in January. Carter BloodCare was founded in 1998 by the merger of two local blood centers, making Carter BloodCare Texas’ largest blood center. In April 2007, Carter BloodCare also merged with Tyler, Texas-based Stewart Regional Blood Center.

" As an implementing partner of USAID’s Democracy Strengthening Program (DSP) in El Salvador, Casals & Associates, a DynCorp International company, recently helped launch the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST), an initiative promoted by the government of the United Kingdom to help countries around the world improve the value of money spent on public infrastructure through increasing accountability and transparency in the management and delivery of construction projects. On Wednesday, December 11, 2013, the initiative was launched as the framework agreement was signed at an event hosted by the Secretary of Strategic Affairs through the Under Secretariat of Transparency and Anticorruption (SSTA). Casals program director, Carlos Guerrero, and Victor Clark, Chargé d’affairs of the British Embassy in El Salvador, acted as witnesses as the agreement was signed by Gerson Martínez, minister of Public Works, Hato Hasbún, secretary of Strategic Affairs; Ramón Villalta, director of Social Initiative for Democracy, Aurora Cubías, undersecretary of Transparency and Anticorruption; and representatives of the Road Maintenance Fund (FOVIAL), the Salvadoran Chamber of the Construction Industry (CASALCO), and the National University of El Salvador (UES). Over the course of several months, with CoST’s technical assistance, representatives from each institution integrated an oversight group and coordinated the preparation of the necessary regulations to launch the CoST program. The CoST team will work together to assure that all monitoring indicators are applied, leading to the success of the program, and future public works projects. The CoST initiative is valuable to El Salvador’s central government as it will be able to effectively measure metrics on public infrastructure projects, contributing to the fight against corruption and to guaranteeing transparency. “If we want to have an open government we must build an open society upon democratic principles, and transparency is eminently a key pillar toward democracy,” said Martinez, minister of Public Works. “When we work for the State we do not manage private resources but public ones, and this is why it is illegitimate to deny information to the citizenry.” Likewise, Victor Clark, Chargé d’affairs of the British Embassy, reiterated that “the CoST initiative is conceived as a measure to contribute in the struggle against corruption considering that global figures indicate that corruption is a common factor in the construction of public works, resulting in the loss of billions of dollars which in turn impairs sustainable demographic development. Corruption is a problem for everyone to face, not just governments; it is not an easy struggle but transparency is a crosscutting issue to its approach.” The signing of the framework agreement for the implementation of the CoST-El Salvador Program set a benchmark in transparency for the construction sector, with monitoring processes for public works. The program is supported by institutions representing civil society, and private and public sectors integrating the oversight group. As a pilot program, monitoring under the CoST initiative will be carried out in five concrete projects: the last stretch of the Integral Transport System for the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador (SITRAMSS), the construction of the San Isidro Bridge; phase two of the Precarious Settlements; and the construction of two overpasses in San Salvador- Rancho Navarra and Masferrer Boulevard.",Public
" DynCorp International will be participating in two job fairs during the month of January.

These thirteen individuals – and brave personnel like them – are key to the success of those missions.” Under the AMDP contract with the U.S. Army, DI assists the NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan/Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (NTM-A/CSTC-A) by providing training and mentoring services for the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior and Afghan National Police.",Public
" DynCorp International team members with Heliworks LLC, a wholly-owned DI subsidiary, gave back to the local community in Pensacola, Fla., during the 2013 holiday season. DI team members first reached out to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), an organization that helps families of fallen military and contractor personnel. Coordinating with TAPS, DI team members made monetary, gift and winter supply donations to local families in Florida during the holidays. DI team members also volunteered to deliver the donations to each family and helped each with much needed minor home repairs. “Working with TAPS was valuable to our staff as we were able to help local families in our community through an organization that has also helped families of DI team members,” said Therese Dotson, Heliworks, LLC, senior human resources generalist. TAPS provides immediate and long-term emotional help, hope and healing to all who are grieving the death of a loved one in military service to America. TAPS meets its mission by providing peer-based emotional support, grief and trauma resources, casework assistance, and connections to community-based care. “We had such an overwhelming response of kindness from our employees that we were able to make a donation to Gulf Coast Kid’s House as well, also local in Pensacola,” said Dotson. Team members provided 11 boxes full of gently-used toys and children’s clothing to the private, not-for-profit which provides services to victims of child abuse in Escambia County. Donations directly benefitted Gulf Coast Kid’s House’s “Jane’s Resource Closet,” their resource room for child clients and their families. Gulf Coast Kid’s House, located at the Marilyn Kapner Levin Center for Children’s Advocacy and Child Abuse Prevention is a children’s advocacy center serving Escambia County, Fla. As a children’s advocacy center, they combine all of the professionals and resources needed for the intervention, investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases under one child-friendly facility.

" DynCorp International team members working in support of the Afghan Ministry of Interior and Afghan National Police Program (AMDP) recognized a need for hazardous materials (HAZMAT) emergency response team training in order to be prepared for any emergency contingency that could occur while in theater. To empower fellow team members to be able to act quickly in the case environments become contaminated with toxic chemicals and substances, the AMDP team established a hazardous waste operations and emergency response (HAZWOPER) training course. Beginning in November 2012, the AMDP team conducted 40-hour training courses open to all program employees. To date, the training has been conducted six times at four different locations in Afghanistan and has certified more than 100 AMDP employees as HAZWOPER response technicians. Additionally, members of the U.S. military and other government employees, as well as AMDP subcontractors, have successfully completed the training. The course trains individuals on clean-up operations, corrective actions, and emergency response operations involving hazardous substances and their storage, disposal, or treatment. In addition to classroom training requirements, in order to be certified responders, one must also complete at least one day of field training, putting what they have learned in the classroom into practice. “The greatest value of the training program is how it has built a much greater level of preparedness into the AMDP team’s ability to effectively respond to emergency situations,” said Richard McEvoy, DynCorp International program manager. “The AMDP Program is proud of the level of preparedness that has been built into its Hazardous Materials Response Program. The heart of that preparedness has been chiefly achieved through the quality of the training that has been provided to team members within that area,” said McEvoy.

" The Washington Post recently featured DynCorp International’s support of the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), which provides assistance to families that have lost a loved one working overseas. TAPS not only supports families of fallen military personnel, but also contractors, and has personally worked with families of former DI team members. “More than 65 percent of our personnel are veterans so supporting the U.S. military has always been a priority at DynCorp International, but working with TAPS is particularly special to us because they have also helped civilian families and, specifically families of DI personnel who have lost their lives while on mission,” Steve Gaffney, chairman and chief executive officer, DynCorp International, previously commented. As part of an ongoing campaign, DI began its “Red Shirt Friday” program in 2011 in which team members all over the world are encouraged to wear red shirts purchased from the DI company store at the end of each week to show their support of U.S. troops. For each shirt sold, the Company donates $10 to TAPS, directly benefitting their valuable programs for survivors. To date, DI has donated more than $50,000 to TAPS through the Red Shirt Friday program alone. DI has supported TAPS through its annual Honor Guard Galas and this year participating in the first ever TysonsRegional™ Chamber 5K Corporate Challenge, raising $10,000 through the event. DI chairman and CEO, Steve Gaffney, also serves as co-chair on the TAPS Leadership Committee. “Sixty-five percent of [our] workforce [are] veterans and the others — even though they didn’t serve — many believe they serve that mission though the civilian workforce,” Gaffney said. TAPS provides ongoing emotional help, hope, and healing to all who are grieving the death of a loved one in military service to America, regardless of relationship to the deceased, geography, or circumstance of the death. TAPS meets its mission by providing peer-based support, crisis care, casualty casework assistance, and grief and trauma resources. Founded out of tragedy in 1994, TAPS has established itself as the front line resource to the families and loved ones of our military men and women. TAPS provides comfort and care through comprehensive services and programs including peer based emotional support, case work assistance, crisis intervention, and grief and trauma resources.

" DynCorp International is once again a proud supporter of the USO of Metropolitan-Washington (USO-Metro) Turkeys for Troops program. The Turkeys for Troops program provides junior-enlisted service members and their families living in the Washington-Baltimore region with food baskets filled with all the traditional trimmings for a Thanksgiving feast. The program was established in 2008 due to an increase in emergency food requests during the holiday season. Since then the program has expanded from serving 500 families in 2008, to 1,200 military families in 2012 and 2013. Turkeys for Troops is funded through corporate donations and funds raised during an annual telethon held on Veteran’s Day. Each food basket provides a local military family with traditional ingredients needed to prepare a Thanksgiving meal for a family of four to six, including a gift card to purchase a fresh turkey from a local grocery store. In addition to supporting Turkeys for Troops through a corporate donation, DI team members will also volunteer to help stuff the Thanksgiving meal boxes and man the telephone bank during the Veteran’s Day telethon. The USO-Metro held its first Turkeys for Troops telethon in 2009 when the number of requests for holiday food assistance from military families tripled from previous years. Local television station WUSA9 offered to host the telethon to raise the funds required to fill this need. This year’s telethon will air on Monday, November 11, 2013, from 5:00 – 7:00 p.m. Donations may also be made online at usometro.org/donate. USO-Metro is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization chartered by Congress, and dedicated to “Serving those who serve, and their families” in Washington D.C., Maryland and Northern Virginia.  It is through the generous financial support of individuals and organizations in the local community that USO-Metro is able to fulfill its mission.

" The U.S. Air Force has chosen to exercise DynCorp International’s fourth option year for an aircraft maintenance support contract at Sheppard Air Force Base (AFB) in Wichita Falls, Texas. “We are proud to continue working with the U.S. Air Force to support the world’s only multi-nationally-manned and managed flying training program,” said Jim Myles, senior vice president, DynAviation. “We are committed to keeping these aircraft ready for the next generation’s pilots.” Under this contract, DI team members provide aircraft maintenance services for the 80th Flying Training Wing based at Sheppard AFB. The initial contract was awarded in 2009, with an 11-month base period and six, one-year options. The current value of the contract, if all options are exercised, is $184.9 million. The mission of the Air Education and Training Command’s 80th Flying Training Wing is to provide undergraduate pilot training for the U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies in the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training program. Graduates of this prestigious program are assigned to fighter pilot positions in their respective air forces. The Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program (ENJJPT) was established in 1973 as the rapidly rising cost of pilot training and the need to improve NATO air forces led a group of European nations to consider combining efforts to develop a consolidated training program. By 1974, the U.S. joined the working group that included Canada, Italy, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The group eventually determined that the U.S. would be the most appropriate host for the program considering factors such as flying weather, training airspace, existing facilities and program growth potential. In 1978, the U.S. was formally selected to host the ENJJPT program for 10 years as a short term solution, while studies on relocation to a European base continued. In June 1980, Sheppard AFB was selected as the site of the ENJJPT program, as the 80th Flying Training Wing was already providing undergraduate pilot training for the German and Dutch air forces. In 1987, the program was extended to 1989, and in 1989, the program was again extended to 2005. Currently, plans are underway to extend the program to 2016. ENJJPT also provides for its own pilot instructor training (a program that teaches pilots to be instructor pilots), Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) course, and IFF Upgrade Instructor Pilot training course. About 200 student pilots graduate ENJJPT annually after a 55-week, three-phase training regimen. These training programs are supported by a staff of more than 1,300 military, civilian and contract personnel employing 242 T-6A, T-37B and T-38C training aircraft.",Public
" Dyn-Australia (DA), a wholly owned DynCorp International subsidiary, supports the Australian Defence Force (ADF) in Kandahar, Afghanistan.

The Mi26T from Vertical-T Air Company is capable of lifting up to 44,000 lbs., and helps transport military cargo containers and recover unserviceable or damaged aircraft. Through this program, the Australian forces are able to move necessary equipment safely and more quickly than if by land. For more than two and a half years Mi26T helicopters have flown supplies into Australian and ISAF forward operating bases, and is now back loading cargo as these bases are handed over to the Afghanistan forces.  This aircraft is still the largest, most powerful, fuel efficient and fastest long range heavy-lift helicopter in the world despite having been produced and flown commercially for the first time in the early 1980s. Its high-economy engine, cargo weight and flight range make it unique in its class. “Using these helicopters keeps soldiers safe by providing an alternative to road travel for vital logistical tasks,” said Bob Breen, Dyn-Australia contract manager. “This program also includes support to ISAF nations in Afghanistan.” Since 2011, DA has supported the Australian Defence Force in Afghanistan. Before then, DA had provided Mi26T helicopter support to the Dutch forces for five years. “We started work in Afghanistan maintaining the air strip in Tarin Kowt – the busiest unpaved military airstrip in the world. In 2004 we began managing ground and air operations support for Mi26T helicopters in support of ISAF,” Jeff Wilkinson, Dyn-Australia managing director comments.",Public

" Several DynCorp International team members in Texas volunteered their Saturday afternoons to work with Habitat for Humanity, helping renovate a local elderly woman’s home. DI team members worked on the exterior of the home, removing old paint and repainting it as part of the Preserve a Home program. “We had a great time working together to make these updates on the home with other local volunteers and were touched by how gracious the home’s owner was after presenting her with a freshly painted exterior,” said Ashley Schultze, DynCorp International senior benefits specialist. Habitat for Humanity’s Preserve a Home program aims to assist homeowners in urban neighborhoods that struggle to maintain and care for the exterior of their homes. Some of these homes have fallen into disrepair, often into code citations, loss of homeowner insurance, loss of equity, and ultimately could face mortgage foreclosure. Qualifying homeowners earning 60% of area median income or less work alongside sponsor and community volunteers and a construction staff to rehabilitate their homes, if they are physically able to do so. Preserve a Home projects include exterior rehabilitations, weatherizations, and Cowtown Brush-Up projects in partnership with the City of Fort Worth. DI team members partnered with the Trinity branch of Habitat for Humanity in this volunteer project. Habitat for Humanity’s vision is that “everyone has access to a quality, affordable home.” Trinity Habitat for Humanity builds and rehabs homes in Johnson, Parker, Tarrant and Wise Counties in Texas. Habitat for Humanity International was founded in 1976 by Millard and Linda Fuller and has built more than 500,000 quality, affordable homes serving more than 2.5 million people worldwide. Habitat for Humanity volunteers, working hand-in-hand with the families they serve, build quality, affordable homes using donations of money and materials. Partner families invest hundreds of hours of sweat equity in the construction of their homes. Once completed, they buy their homes, making monthly payments on an interest-free mortgage. Their house payments revolve back into Habitat’s work; a dollar invested in Habitat is a buck that never stops — it just keeps building. With more than 1,500 U.S. affiliates and 550 international affiliates coordinating Habitat house-building projects in over 3,000 communities around the world, Habitat has attracted millions of volunteers, from U.S. presidents to celebrities. Fort Worth Area Habitat for Humanity, Inc. was founded in 1989 as an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, serving Fort Worth and Tarrant County. In 2006, the name was changed to Trinity Habitat for Humanity to include the four counties they now serve. Having grown from a handful of dedicated founders into a volunteer corps of thousands, today Trinity Habitat for Humanity is ranked #20 out of 1,571 Habitat affiliates in the nation in new home production.",Public

" DynCorp International team members recently spent time on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., meeting with several members of Congress and sharing their stories about DI’s programs all over the world. Beth Cameron, a mentor on the Afghan Ministry of Interior Afghan National Police Development Program (AMDP), teamed up with DI’s Government Relations Center of Excellence to discuss her experiences working in Afghanistan. Cameron met with Senators Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, as well as Representatives Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, Jim Langevin of Rhode Island, Martha Roby of Alabama and Joe Courtney of Connecticut.  Meetings were also held with professional staff from each of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees.

She was able to share her perspective on the role of women working within the Afghanistan National Police, and the success of the Family Response Unit in combating violence against women. Working in Afghanistan provided Cameron and other DI team members with unique opportunities to provide humanitarian assistance directly to women and children within the local community through donations of clothing, school supplies and other essential items. “The most rewarding part of my work was to witness the many successes of Afghan women. No matter how small the accomplishment, whether it was advancing their literacy or to attend and graduate training classes, each step forward in progress was a miracle to be a part of,” said Cameron. “The women who graduated the police training program were and continue to be a very crucial part of the advancement of women towards equality and securing women’s rights. They serve as role models for the young women who most symbolize the future of how women are accepted. It was truly a humbling experience for me to have the incredible opportunity to work with and provide training for them.” Cameron also described the importance of continued support of training programs overseas, commenting, “The continued support of these programs would not only provide continuity and consistency, but further address the ever-changing needs of societies that face such overwhelming adversities.” Under the AMDP contract with the U.S. Army, DI assists the NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan/Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan (NTM-A/CSTC-A) by providing training and mentoring services for the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior and Afghan National Police.",Public

Casals team members worked in conjunction with academic coordinators and professors of participating higher education institutions to create the PECUS program, which promotes an ethics culture among young future graduates by developing the necessary skills and knowledge to become ethical citizens, leaders and professionals. On August 28, 2013, more than 150 students from five local Salvadoran universities attended a launch event for the program. U.S. Ambassador Mari Carmen Aponte gave the opening address at the event and congratulated students for enrolling in this important initiative and for their willingness to become agents for positive change and contributing to building a more democratic society. “Ethics must be a constant in our daily lives if we are to be responsible, always doing the right thing, acknowledging the fact that moral obligations are present at all times with the self, with family, with our community, our academic institutions, our professions, jobs, our society, our nation. Democracy cannot flourish without ethics, and politics is profoundly linked to ethics. We all have rights but we must act rightfully in order to succeed and in order to build an empowered society that fights and beats corruption,” said Aponte. PECUS is an innovative, five module training-for-trainees program that fosters the need, importance and benefits of building, having and being part of a culture of ethics and transparency starting at the early stages of an individual’s educational development. The program is aimed to raise ethical awareness while encouraging  students and faculty to get involved with this academic integrity initiative in the classroom as well as in their everyday lives and in their communities. An advisory committee of 15 university professors and academic coordinators met monthly with the Casals team to design and formulate the training methodology, contents of the five modules and determine the profile competencies of the consultants and speakers who will be providing the trainings.

" DynCorp International parent, Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc., recently reported second quarter 2013 financial results. Second quarter revenue decreased $84.6 million, or 8.8%, to $876.5 million compared to second quarter 2012, primarily driven by lower content under the Company’s Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) IV contract and reduced demand for training needs as the war in Afghanistan winds down. This was partially offset by a $67.2 million increase in revenue from the Aviation Group based on the improved performance of the Contract Field Team (CFT), NASA Aircraft Maintenance Operational Support program and T-6 Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (T6-COMBS) contracts. Net income attributable for the second quarter 2013 was $8.3 million, representing a decrease of $0.7 million compared to second quarter 2012. Net income attributable was primarily impacted by reduced demand for services related to the declining operational tempo in the war in Afghanistan. This was partially offset by continued growth of the DynAviation business, lower interest expense during the quarter as a result of the $90 million reduction in long-term debt during 2012 and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $48.6 million for the second quarter, representing 5.5% of revenue, and a 6.2% decrease from the same period in 2012. “No matter how tough the operational tempo, this quarter showed that our 30,000 employees and team mates around the world are dedicated to coming together, pulling in the same direction, delivering outstanding services to our customers all while improving operating margins,” said Steve Gaffney, chairman and CEO. “During the quarter, we implemented organizational changes that are already improving our operational efficiency and reducing costs.”",Public

" DynCorp International regional safety manager Brandon Dunkin has been named one of this year’s National Safety Council’s (NSC) “Rising Stars of Safety.” Dunkin, along with the other NSC’s Rising Stars for 2013 are being recognized for their “commitment to safety, influence on safety culture and creation of safety initiatives producing measureable outcomes.” Dunkin, who manages occupational health and safety for thousands of DI employees in the Regional Command South Afghanistan region who support the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP), was selected from a large field of nominees in the safety industry from corporations across the U.S. All candidates were reviewed on criteria that include leadership attributes, examples of safety initiatives producing measureable outcomes, and the engagement of peers in transforming a safety culture, among other aspects involved with safety at large organizations. Selections were made through a blind evaluation of the entire nominee pool.  Dunkin will be honored at the 2013 NSC Congress & Expo in Chicago, Ill. in October, featured in NSC’s Safety & Health magazine, and on www.nsc.org. “It’s my pleasure to represent DynCorp International in the realm of safety while working in Afghanistan on LOGCAP since 2009,” said Dunkin. “I couldn’t have accomplished this feat without the motivation and dedication of each of my teammates in the field and the guidance given over the past four years from DI’s outstanding leadership.” Dunkin’s responsibilities include one-on-one interaction with DI team members in the field – training and mentoring them on the regulations established for their protection in the field. When an injury occurs, and an investigation process begins, Dunkin and a team of safety professionals search for the root cause and find out how similar incidents can be prevented in the future. “Brandon was one of the first hires to the Health Safety and Environment (HSE) organization, was hired into an entry level position and has moved up in the organization due to his exceptional attitude and hard work,” said Dunkin’s nominator LOGCAP IV HSE director Barry Whiting. “His dedication to continually improving our HSE program make him incredibly deserving of this prestigious honor.” The NSC Rising Stars of Safety program honors leaders of tomorrow for their commitment to safety, influence on safety culture, promotion of continuous workplace safety improvement and creation of safety initiatives producing measurable outcomes – the foundational pillars of the National Safety Council’s Journey to Safety Excellence. Founded in 1913 and chartered by Congress, the National Safety Council is a non-profit organization whose mission is to save lives by preventing injuries and deaths at work, in homes and communities, and on the road through leadership, research, education and advocacy. NSC advances this mission by partnering with businesses, government agencies, elected officials and the public in areas that can make the most impact — distracted driving, teen driving, workplace safety and safety beyond the workplace.",Public

" DynCorp International today announced that it has been awarded a modification under a previously awarded Naval Facilities Engineering Command-Pacific contract to provide operations support services within the Republic of the Philippines. “We have celebrated significant growth in this program and are honored to be able to continue working with the U.S. military in the Philippines,” said George Krivo, senior vice president, DynLogistics. Work performed under this contract includes all labor, supervision, management, tools, materials, equipment, facilities, transportation, incidental engineering, and other necessary support services. This is the first of four, one-year options to be exercised; it has a value of $44.9 million, for a total cumulative contract value of $223.5 million. The base year was awarded in June 2012. DI has supported the U.S. Naval Facilities Engineering Command-Pacific on this program since 2008 and previous to that contract award was the managing partner to Contingency Response Services LLC who was the incumbent prior to 2008. The DI team in the Philippines attributes their success to many factors, one of which is their commitment to safety. Recently the team celebrated a milestone – ten million hours worked incident-free. Their top-notch safety program empowers team members to achieve their goals by educating and energizing them on the importance of safety procedures. For example, last year the team developed a “Safety Festival” where employees put together a series of short classes within their specialties, and small groups would rotate through each station for 15 minute hands-on educational safety sessions. Station topics, among many, included seasonal protection, fire-related safety and vector-borne diseases. “Small initiatives like the Safety Festival are a positive way to elevate safety awareness within the team, an ongoing attitude carried by the efforts of the dedicated employees on this program,” said Robert Katz, DynCorp International project manager. “When I began working on this program I immediately found a sense of loyalty and purpose among the entire team. We have a sizable Filipino local national workforce, and as we grew to know each other, it was clear that they understood and respected the Government’s mission that we support, and were totally dedicated to doing the right thing – a major element of our company’s core values,” said Katz. “Time and again, our team has risen to the cause, and embraced their job performance with a sincere attention to caring in order to meet commitments.  This mission is fluid; schedules change and requirements follow – if not for the willingness and professionalism of our staff, we would not be able to serve the customer the way we do.”",Public

" DynCorp International team members in Fort Worth, Texas, are showing how “DI Cares” by supporting Community Storehouse’s Summer Lunch program. For many local children, when school is out for the summer, so is access to free or reduced price lunch options. Community Storehouse provides qualified families access to their food pantry in the summer to pick up extra kid-friendly foods as needed for their school-aged children through this special program. DI team members are chipping in by donating non-perishable food items to help fill the food pantry throughout the month of June and placing online donations to directly benefit the program. “Once we learned about this great program at Community Storehouse we were excited to be able to support it,” said Jan Gillespie, DynCorp International Treasury associate. “The Treasury and Risk team members collaborated and saw this as a unique opportunity for the DI Forth Worth team to partner with a local organization that supports the families of our surrounding communities.” All qualified families are able to register for this Community Storehouse program. Those who qualify may come to Community Storehouse’s food pantry to pick up extra kid-friendly food as needed for their children who are out of school. Children, normally qualifying for the governmental free/reduced lunch program during the school year, experience food insecurity when school is not in session. This important hunger prevention program assistance is provided in June, July and August. Individuals wishing to participate in this program should consult their child’s school counselor to see if they qualify for this program. Keeping children active and thriving in the Keller and Northwest Independent School Districts is what Community Storehouse is all about. Community Storehouse is the only non-profit, 501(c)3 children’s charity in northeast Tarrant County focused on this mission. From time to time, a variety of seemingly insurmountable obstacles can spring up between children and their success in school: severe or terminal illness that strikes them or a parent; a parent’s job loss; family poverty; or even sudden death in the family. Community Storehouse assists children and their families who face these challenges or any other with a variety of services for education – which include reading and school supplies programs – and well-being, with help in nutrition, clothing and health care.",Public
" DynCorp International team members volunteered their free time to help organize and host a dental care workshop at Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras. DI’s team brought in six dentists from the Honduran School of Dentistry in Tegucigalpa to provide dental exams, evaluations, conduct sessions on dental care and oral hygiene, all free of charge to personnel on base. Each “patient” was given one-on-one treatment and received a dentist’s written evaluation and recommendations for future care. “Access to medical care can be expensive and also hard to obtain in this area. By bringing the dental professionals in-house, we are able to ensure that those on base are given the proper education on dental practices and can be proactive about their health,” said Noema Reyes, DynCorp International executive assistant. “Tying into DI’s overall health and wellness initiative, Healthy Outcomes, we think it is important to provide these valuable services to those we serve, as well as our own team members,” said DynCorp International program manager, Arturo Buxo. In December 2012, DynCorp International was awarded a contract with the U.S. Army to provide base operation support services at Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras.

" DynCorp International recently donated $2,500 to the Care and Share Food Bank of Southern Colorado to support the firefighters and those affected by the Black Forest and Canon City wildfires. “This cause is near and dear to us as our own team members have helped fight wild land fires,” said Jeffrey Cavarra, DynCorp International program manager, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, (CAL FIRE). “We know firsthand how hard those firefighters are working and we are happy to help in any way we can.” Thousands of Colorado citizens have been forced to evacuate their homes as the fires continue to spread. Dozens of homes have been destroyed leaving many displaced and in need of food, shelter and other essential items. For more information on donating to the Care and Share Food Bank of Southern Colorado, visit http://careandshare.org/. Care and Share was established more than 35 years ago by Franciscan Sister Dominique Pisciotta as a referral agency to coordinate food distribution in the Southern Colorado area. The organization continued to evolve and grew from a simple clearinghouse for food distribution to a complex telephone referral service and food bank administrator. Care and Share is now a member of the Feeding America network and focuses mainly on food distribution. In addition to providing food resources, Feeding America serves as a resource for professional development and networking opportunities, as well as coordinating efforts for product donations and distribution in disaster situations. DynCorp International has worked with CAL FIRE since 2001 helping suppress and control wild land fires in California. As part of the program, DI flies and maintains Grumman S-2T fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft, and fully maintains and services civilian UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots. Operating from across California, aircraft can reach most fires within 20 minutes. The OV-10A aircraft fly over fires, directing the air tankers and helicopters to critical areas for retardant and water drops. The retardant used to slow or retard the spread of a fire is a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum-thickening agent, and a coloring agent. While both airtankers and helicopters are equipped to carry fire retardant or water, the helicopters can also transport firefighters, equipment and injured personnel. All CAL FIRE Aircraft are strategically located throughout the state at airbases and helicopter bases. During high fire activity, CAL FIRE may move aircraft to better provide statewide air support. The department’s firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft respond to an average of more than 5,600 wildland fires each year. Those fires burn more than 172,000 acres annually.",Public

Highlights include revenue of $932.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $53.3 million. “Despite U.S. government budget issues and the shifting focus in Afghanistan, our team delivered increased earnings and strong EBITDA margins while managing a reduction in the top line,” said Steve Gaffney, chairman and CEO. “Looking ahead, as organizational changes that were made in the beginning of the second quarter mature, I expect to see even more opportunity arise.

" “Among other missions,” writes DI NASA program manager Jim Snowden, “our team flies to Russia to pick up U.S. astronauts returning via the Russian Soyuz capsule from the International Space Station.” DI team members participated in NASA astronaut Kevin Ford’s return to the United States after 142 days aboard the International Space Station. Ford returned to Earth via a Russian Soyuz space capsule and landed in Kazakhstan March 16. The next day he was flown back to the United States in a specially equipped NASA Gulfstream III, maintained and crewed by NASA and DynCorp International team members. The mission was commanded by NASA Aircraft Operations branch chief pilot Bill Ehrenstrom and piloted by DI’s Tom Ryan. Prior to the mission, DI mechanics James Molina, Scott Leonard, Johnny Scott, Mike Brown and Keith Halkard worked diligently to de-configure the aircraft from a recent research mission and then configure the aircraft for this “Direct Return” mission. The work entailed removing racks of research equipment, interior furnishings and other support equipment. Then the team installed beds, chairs and medical equipment to support the astronaut’s trip back to the U.S. In addition to preparing the interior, the mechanics completed scheduled maintenance to ensure top performance for this important mission. Mechanic Johnny Scott accompanied the aircraft to provide servicing and maintenance as needed. Support provided by all of the DI mechanics ensured the mission was successful and the aircraft was able to provide safe, reliable and comfortable transportation for the aircrew and passengers. The next astronaut Direct Return mission is planned for mid-May. In the meantime, the aircraft will be reconfigured to resume research missions across North and Central America. DI has provided aircraft maintenance and support for NASA – the National Aeronautics and Space Administration – since June 2012.

" When the DynCorp International team working in support of the NASA Aircraft Maintenance and Operational Support (AMOS) contract at Johnson Space Center needed to quickly deploy a NASA GIII Gulfstream aircraft for a critical research mission, they knew they could rely on DI team members from the Joint-Base Andrews to provide their expertise. “The aircraft was progressing through the maintenance activities but the completion deadline was quickly approaching,” said Jim Snowden, executive manager, NASA Aircraft Maintenance and Operations Support for DynCorp International. “Our director of maintenance knew the caliber of personnel working with DI at Joint-Base Andrews, who are responsible for supporting the United States Air Force, 89th Airlift Wing fleet of Very Important Person Special Air Mission (VIPSAM) aircraft.” The DI NASA team coordinated with aircraft mechanics from Joint-Base Andrews with specialties in engines and flight controls to assist with the maintenance at the Johnson Space Center. The specialists were seamlessly integrated into the maintenance work flow and their assistance greatly impacted the swift engine and airframe maintenance necessary to be mission-ready. “Their knowledge and experience not only proved to be valuable in completing the mission, but they were also able to provide some unique training to the DI team at Johnson Space Center on Gulfstream engines,” commented Snowden. “The use of resources between different programs signifies how committed the DI team at NASA is to being innovative, reliable, and delivering the best services.” The specially modified Gulfstream III aircraft is currently deployed in Costa Rica to fly NASA Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) missions.  AirMOSS missions aim to provide high-resolution observations of root-zone soil moisture over regions of the major North American climatic habitats (biomes), quantify the impact of variations in soil moisture on regional carbon fluxes and extrapolate the reduced-uncertainty estimates of regional carbon fluxes to the continental scale of North America. North American ecosystems are critical components of the global carbon cycle, exchanging large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases with the atmosphere. Root-zone soil measurements can be used to better understand these carbon fluxes and their associated uncertainties on a continental scale. AirMOSS uses an airborne ultra-high frequency synthetic aperture radar that has the capability to penetrate through substantial vegetation canopies and soil to depths down to approximately 1.2 meters. For AirMOSS, NASA’s Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) is flown on a Gulfstream III aircraft. Extensive ground, tower, and aircraft in-situ measurements validate root-zone soil measurements and carbon flux model estimates. The surveys provide measurements at 100 meter spatial resolution and at sub-weekly, seasonal, and annual time scales.",Public

" DynCorp International recently donated 500 iPod Touch devices to benefit the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex Toys for Tots program. The Toys for Tots program collects new, unwrapped toys during each holiday season to distribute as gifts to children in need in the local community. The Marine Corps Toys for Tots program was established in 1947, when Major Bill Hendricks, U.S. Corps Reserve, was searching for an organization to donate a doll that his wife made as a holiday present. No organization existed so he and a group of Marine Reservists launched a program to collect and distribute toys to children in need in the Los Angeles, Calif. area. The next year they expanded the program to a national campaign and now every community with a Marine Reserve Center participates in the holiday program. The Toys for Tots program objectives are to help less fortunate children throughout the U.S. experience the joy during the holiday season, to play an active role in the development of one of the nation’s most valuable resources – children, to unite all members of local communities in a common cause each year during the annual toy collection and distribution campaign and to contribute to a better future for many communities. Volunteers in the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, area support Toys for Tots by helping collect donations and monetary support.

" DynCorp International’s John Dillenbeck is featured in an article in G.I. Jobs magazine where he describes his transition from the military to a corporate role. Dillenbeck supports DI’s Intelligence Training and Solutions business area, where he uses his experience in the military daily, focusing on commercial and government clients that require training in the intelligence field. His background as a counter-intelligence specialist in the U.S. Marine Corps is a valuable asset in putting together business proposals as well as consulting current customers. Dillenbeck enlisted in the Marines in 1994, where he served for 15 years in counter-intelligence work. He supported Special Forces units all over the world as a gunnery sergeant. When he left the Marines, Dillenbeck networked with friends and colleagues, knowing he wanted to continue working in the intelligence field. A former supervisor worked at DynCorp International and encouraged him to apply to a contract position. He was soon hired and worked on a contract basis until 2011 on several client projects before moving his current role. When he found out about the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program, he decided to take advantage and become certified in business development proposal management by Shipley Associates. He will complete his Shipley training this year. “This training helped me transition into my current business development position with DI,” Dillenbeck says. “When I told my supervisors that I wanted to take the Shipley classes, they were very supportive and saw this would make me a more valuable employee. “I encourage veterans to take advantage of the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program,” he continued. “Too many veterans think they have to follow a civilian version of their military careers and do the same thing. But with all the educational benefits available, veterans can go to school or pursue other professional fields that interest them.” Dillenbeck suggests that all veterans making the transition from the military identify what kind of job will truly make them happy and to take advantage for the educational benefits they have earned. When asked what he enjoys most about his job, he says that DI, “truly invests in its employees. They were very supportive when I said I wanted to get proposal management training from Shipley Associates.” Veterans make up more than 60 percent of DI’s total workforce.

" DynCorp International provided assistance to the local community in Mindanao, Philippines after Typhoon Pablo hit the island in December. The area suffered from flash floods and landslides that left thousands homeless and in need. DI’s Philippines Operations Support (POS) team provides support services in the area and was eager to respond and help in any way they could. They established what they called “Operation Pablo,” which resulted in an outpouring of aid for those devastated by the storm. The team collected and delivered not only monetary donations but also truckloads of clothing, blankets and essentials including kilos of rice and powdered milk, thousands of cereal packets, and cases of sardines. The DI POS team delivered the aid to a consolidating area at a local school, organized by the Social Awareness and Community Service Involvement (SACSI) office, and from there it was distributed to those in need in disaster areas. DynCorp International program manager Bob Katz explains that Operation Pablo grew out of a simple suggestion to forego gift exchanges and a Christmas feast and to instead donate to the typhoon victims. “That was the genesis of the project,” Katz explained. “Our team members recognized the overwhelming need – families with little to begin with, now had virtually nothing but the clothes on their backs – and because they cared, they had to act.” Katz adds, “What impresses me most about Operation Pablo is how it came alive so naturally; a need existed and without hesitation the team took action – it’s the same philosophy this outstanding group of men and women applies every single day.

" DynCorp International Contract Field Team (CFT) members at Camp Bondsteel, Kosovo, support the U.S. Army’s Theater Sustainment Manager assigned to the aviation taskforce supporting NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR). The team provides all levels of aircraft maintenance support, including limited depot repairs, in support of KFOR’s aviation taskforce. Services that are routinely provided include scheduled preventive maintenance checks and services, airframe structural repairs, troubleshooting and repair of aircraft systems, and back shop component repairs. DI has provided continuous aircraft maintenance support to KFOR since May 2001. In addition to quality aircraft maintenance support, these DI team members serve as an invaluable source of continuity during the transition period between unit nine-month cycle rotations.

The inspection interval, or number of flight hours between inspections, may be different for each type of aircraft, but ultimately each aircraft’s inspection cycle will culminate in a periodic Phased Maintenance Inspection (PMI). The PMI inspection is a comprehensive and thorough inspection of the complete aircraft, ensuring that there are no safety-of-flight conditions. “Each aircraft’s deferred workload is different, and there is no way to know beforehand what safety-of-flight conditions may exist. However the DI team at Camp Bondsteel excels at being able to anticipate challenges and being flexible enough to meet the requirements of a changing scenario,” said John Purdy, DynCorp International site supervisor.

" DynCorp International (DI) team members working overseas are doing their part to help members of the military who are serving in Afghanistan celebrate Thanksgiving by serving nearly 30,000 traditional holidays meals. “We are proud to be able to bring our warfighters a taste of home by providing them with a traditional Thanksgiving meal all the way in Afghanistan,” said James Grazioplene, group vice president, Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP), DynCorp International. “Our team exemplifies the DI core values and goes above and beyond to make this a special day to show how thankful we are for those serving our country.” DI’s food service teams working across Afghanistan are planning to serve all the trimmings for a Thanksgiving meal including: In addition, food service managers have been preparing Thanksgiving decorations for the U.S. military and civilian personnel to enjoy. As part of the LOGCAP IV program in Afghanistan, nearly 1,200 DI team members work on the food service team which operates 37 full-service dining facilities. DI serves as one of the three contractors currently providing support to the U.S. and Coalition troops overseas under the LOGCAP IV contract. Among task orders awarded to DynCorp International on LOGCAP IV, the company supports the U.S. Army in Southern Afghanistan. Under this task order, DI is providing existing bases with operations and maintenance support, including facilities management, electrical power, water, sewage and waste management, laundry operations, food services, and transportation motor pool operations, as well as construction services for other sites. Making Thanksgiving a special day for those who serve has become a priority for DI team members around the world. Last year, DynCorp International’s food service staff provided a full Thanksgiving feast in Afghanistan, serving all the traditional fare from roast turkey to homemade pies and freshly baked breads. Décor also included a Mayflower ship made from a watermelon and cakes decorated with turkey images. Several DI team members from Falls Church, Va. recently volunteered their time to help the USO of Metropolitan Washington (USO-Metro) fill Thanksgiving baskets to be distributed to military families as part of the Turkeys for Troops program.

" As part of their participation in the USO of Metropolitan Washington (USO-Metro) Turkeys for Troops program, dozens of DynCorp International team members volunteered their time to help pack Thanksgiving boxes for local military families. DI personnel joined other USO volunteers at Fort Belvoir to fill each box with the essentials for a Thanksgiving meal. –From cake and bread mixes, to canned fruits and vegetables, the boxes contained everything a family could want, including a gift card to purchase a turkey from their local grocery store. USO Metro organizes the annual event as another way to say thank you to military families. Salaries for junior enlisted soldiers are modest and for many families a Thanksgiving feast can be a big expense. “Turkeys for Troops” is open to active duty service members at the E5 rank and below who sign up for the program and are approved in advance. Volunteers pack the boxes, deliver them to military posts in the area and distribute them to enlisted service members. The box stuffing event, which took place Saturday, November 17, 2012, wasn’t only a good deed, it was a great workout! Volunteers rolled up their sleeves to pack hundreds of boxes with non-perishable Thanksgiving fixings including corn, peas, green beans and yams; cake mix, icing, and pie crust; cornbread, cranberry sauce, and gravy. Kenneth Juergens, Global Logistics and Development Solutions group vice president, Joe Kale, chief compliance officer and Ashley Burke, vice president of communications joined scores of DI volunteers who were accompanied by family and friends, packing box after box. In just three hours more than 800 boxes were ready for delivery to grateful families in perfect time for the upcoming holiday on Thursday. “The DI team made a difference for hundreds of families in just a few hours,” Burke said. “The USO does such a great job organizing events that allow us to thank those who serve; we’re proud to be among their top sponsors.”",Public
" To help local children in the Pristina Women’s and Children’s Center in Kosovo prepare for the school year, DynCorp International (DI) recently donated backpacks full of essential school supplies. The children, mostly orphans, received DI backpacks filled with pens, paper, calculators, notebooks, pencils, pencil sharpeners, erasers, crayons and other items they will need for the classroom. Team members from DCH, a wholly-owned DI subsidiary working in support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to maintain NATO Kosovo Forces (KFOR) facilities at Camp Film City, also spent their free time improving landscaping at the center’s schoolyard, adding grass and plants for the children and volunteers to enjoy. The DCH team often spends much of its free time volunteering at the Women’s and Children’s Center in Pristina. Earlier this year, several DynCorp International team members helped maintain facilities by cleaning, installing and repairing equipment at the center. They also helped update the playground at the center, installing new playground equipment, a small amphitheater and landscaping. The Women’s and Children’s Wellness Center was founded in 2001 and is located on Camp Film City in Pristina, Kosovo. The center is run solely by volunteers and operates on donations from the Camp Film City personnel. Nearly 50 children are cared for at the center, many of whom are orphans ranging in age from four to 16 years old. Local communities also benefit from the center, receiving clothing and food. DCH team members often partner with KFOR personnel to support the center, participating in fundraisers, helping maintain facilities and volunteering time. In working with the City of Pristina, volunteers hope that the center will eventually become a self-sufficient day-care center for the community. DCH, a wholly-owned DynCorp International subsidiary formed in 2007, furnishes all labor, services and materials necessary to operate, maintain, repair and alter of facilities and related systems and equipment located at HQ KFOR Main on Film City in Pristina, Kosovo and sub-sites located throughout Kosovo.",Public

" DynCorp International team members located at the Falls Church, Va. headquarters and Alexandria, Va. offices donated nearly 500 pounds of food towards this year’s Food for Others Thanksgiving Food Drive. Food for Others collects items necessary for a complete Thanksgiving meal and puts together baskets that will provide a full holiday meal for families in the Northern Virginia area. DynCorp International team members donated canned potatoes, canned fruit, gravy, stuffing mix and other non-perishable items to complete Thanksgiving meal baskets. Last year, DI donated more than 400 lbs. of food to Food for Others. Established in 1995, Food for Others serves families in the Northern Virginia area that may need food donations when an emergency strikes, and for the growing number of working poor who are unable to make ends meet and need to supplement their inadequate food supplies. Food for Others obtains much of its food through food rescue operations and food drives. Through food rescue operations, staff and volunteers pick up non-expired food items that would be otherwise thrown away from local grocery stores and other retail food establishments. The food is brought to the warehouse for temporary storage, including refrigeration as appropriate. Food drives contribute to most of the non-perishable food supply. Food for Others’ mission is to obtain and distribute free food to those in need in the Northern Virginia area and to support food programs of other community-based organizations. Food for Others also provides a channel for people to volunteer their services and help their neighbors in need. Local merchants, the USDA, food drives, and crop harvests provide the food; volunteers and staff provide the hands; and charitable contributions and fundraising events provide the funds. Charitable contributions provide a major part of Food for Others’ budget. About 96 cents out of every revenue dollar is used for program expenses. The DynCorp International values that we apply to our job performance – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform, We Do the Right Thing – are also values that we carry into the communities where we live and work, especially around the holidays. It is a priority to DI team members in Falls Church, Va. and Alexandria, Va. to support our neighbors in the Northern Virginia area by participating in activities like local food drives.

" DynCorp International team members have provided communications support for the Maritime Prepositioning Ship Squadron One (MPSRON-1) flagship for 11 years under a contract with United States Navy for the operation and maintenance of Communication Suites aboard Military Sealift Command vessels. As Squadron One was retired on September 28, 2012, DI’s Navy Military Sealift Command’s Communication Suites program was recognized by the U.S. Navy for its support. “As the communications contracting company aboard the flagship of this fine squadron, I thought it fitting to send you a disestablishment coin recognizing the great work that DynCorp has done. Communication is the backbone of any successful mission. DynCorp has been an integral part of our success for years. Please accept this coin as a token of my appreciation for the fine work your team has done,” said R.W. Polk, Captain, U.S. Navy, in a letter accompanied by a commemorative coin. “We support the commodore and Navy staff on the three flagship vessels,” Mike McFarlin, DI program manager for the Navy Military Sealift Command’s Communication Suites comments. “If they write a Naval message, we send it; if they phone or email, we handle the transmission. We have a DI communications representative in the communications suite 24/7, 365 days a year.” DI also provides communications support for Squadron Two, positioned in the Indian Ocean, and Squadron Three, positioned in the western Pacific Ocean. The squadrons consist of multiple cargo ships that carry enough supplies to support a Marine air or ground task force for up to 30 days. “They’re floating warehouses,” McFarlin explains. “More than 600 feet long by 106 feet wide and 10 stories high – they carry trucks, tanks, bulldozers as well as food, military hospital equipment and barges to offload it all.” Squadron One was disestablished as the Navy repositions its fleet and geographic focus. Since 1985, its ships maintained a presence in the Mediterranean Sea, conducting port visits and multi-national exercises. Now, Squadron One flagship USNS 2ND LT. JOHN P. BOBO, named in honor of a Marine recipient of the Medal of Honor, will serve as an alternate flagship for Squadron Three. “Our company has tremendous depth of experience in the area of maritime support. We have managed oil spill response vessels, oceanographic research vessels and depot-level maintenance of prepositioned hospitals units. Just a few years back, we even managed the overhaul of the USS INTREPID,” said McFarlin. “This is our twelfth year supporting the Military Sealift Command and it shows the respect and appreciation the customer has for the work we’ve done and continue to do.”",Public
" DynCorp International police advisors working in support of the U.S. Civilian Police (CIVPOL) contract with the U.S. State Department’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in South Sudan as part of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), recently assisted the South Sudan National Security (SSNS) and South Sudan National Police Service (SSNPS) with the recovery of a 50 meter police services boat. The boat sunk in the Nile River at the Malakal River Port in the Upper Nile State, South Sudan. Recovery of the boat was vital as it is needed by the SSNPS and SSNS to transport personnel, supplies and payroll to areas not accessible by road during the heavy rain season. DynCorp International CIVPOL team lead and police advisor, Stephen Kirn, serves as the Deputy State Advisor (DSA) for Upper Nile State. Kirn coordinated the recovery effort for more than a month, lobbying for a crane and operators as well as security and crowd control services during the operation. DI team members and police advisors Richard Aiken and Dewey Rice also assisted in the two-part recovery operation. A crane was used to remove the boat from the river and taken to another location for repairs. By recovering the boat and getting it back in an operational state, DI helped serve the South Sudan police mission by providing transportation when roads to remote posts are impassible due to heavy seasonal rains. The CIVPOL Advisors worked with the South Sudan Police and Security Services to make the recovery a team effort and demonstrate a strong commitment to providing consistent police services to the communities they serve. DynCorp International supports UNMISS by providing a U.S. contingent of up to 15 law enforcement, judicial, and corrections advisors. The mission is focused on re-building South Sudan’s security infrastructure. Law enforcement specialists train, equip, and mentor the South Sudanese police force in democratic principles; judicial advisors help develop and improve the justice system; and corrections advisors work with local counterparts to help modernize the prison system.",Public

However, after three interviews, he was offered a position to support an anticorruption project. “I was thrilled to be able to use the expertise from my previous position to assist on a program where everyone was exhibiting honesty and hard work,” he said.

" DynCorp International (DI) Chairman and CEO Steve Gaffney was featured in an interview in the Washington Post’s Capital Business section. In the interview, he described why he believes service contractors should be private rather than public and DI’s long-term strategy as the wars wind down overseas. Gaffney joined DI more than two years ago, just as the company went private. He described how the change has affected the company positively. “Instead of trying to satisfy the investors on a quarterly basis, we can actually talk to them about our long-term plans. What that allows us to do is be patient and invest in the things that we need to invest in versus trying to satisfy the short-term view of the markets. That sometimes causes bad behaviors [and] wrong decisions. There are types of companies that should be private, and services companies are one of them,” Gaffney commented. Gaffney believes that service contractors should be private because the portfolio of programs they hold doesn’t operate in the same way as a manufacturer with a consistent production level. With different transition points and other factors Gaffney calls “normal” and “expected,” service contractors’ business is more difficult to explain to analysts. In terms of business development strategies, Gaffney explained how DI has reorganized to focus more on business development. “It really comes down to: Do you have the right people doing the right things? Are you organized the right way? And the business systems that you have in place — are they strong enough to support the pressures of the business? About 90 percent of our top three levels of leadership are either new to the company or they’re new in position. In two years, we’ve restructured twice around getting to the right market-focused, customer-focused type of organization. We stood up a new business development organization, and we were able to move our win rates from the low teens to close to 50 percent of everything that we bid,” Gaffney commented. DI’s business development function has been strengthened by uniting what were previously two separate operating divisions. Weekly meetings also helped solidify business development strategies from the beginning stages through the proposal process, Gaffney explained. Asked about the Company’s strategy as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wind down, Gaffney explained, “We’ve been thinking about this issue around what’s next for some time, and that’s why we’ve been working to rebalance our portfolio since I got here.” “Our aviation business, for instance — today it’s a third of our revenues and half of our earnings. That wasn’t the case two short years ago. A couple months ago, we made a small acquisition in the aviation business to fill a gap that we had, not for the business that we have today but to compete for business two years from now and also get us into the commercial space,” said Gaffney.",Public

Gaffney discussed changes that have occurred in the defense contracting industry in the last 30 years. “What I’ve noticed is you actually have to look at what’s been going on in the country which feeds into ‘how does the Defense Department and the acquisition arm react?’” Gaffney commented. When discussing the state of the industry in the 1980s, Gaffney said, “There was this partnership between the government and industry, which led to most of the contracts at the time [being] fixed-price, so it was very common to take fixed-price contracts for very complex projects.” In the 2000s, after 9/11, compelling government needs to support U.S. foreign policy led to a more competitive industry, focused on innovation. “Whenever there was a lot of competition, it really brought out the best in the industry,” Gaffney said. Gaffney then discussed how DI has anticipated changes in the industry and reshaped its portfolio, as well as how the Company serves its customers. “Do I think we’re fundamentally going to shift away from national security and supporting contingency work? I don’t think so. But do I see a time that we’re actually going to shift to the Pacific Rim or shift to actually trying to serve the mission much more efficiently? And the answer to that is yes,” commented Gaffney. In terms of how DI has shifted organizationally, Gaffney commented, “We are going to be asked to do more with less.” “Those are the types of things we’ve been focused on. How do we serve the mission better? That’s why we restructure, that’s why we look at getting the leadership in place that looks towards the future and not so much towards the past. How can we better serve that customer so that in the future they pick us for new wins?” Gaffney attributes recent contract wins on the strong teams in place at DynCorp International. “It all comes down to literally building a team that is able to confront the realities of the marketplace on a recurring basis in order to figure out ways to win.” “You have to have the right values because as a service provider, our people are our products. It’s important that you have the appropriate leadership in place so that they, the customer, want to continue to do business with us,” he added. Government Contracting Weekly is a television show that informs and helps companies win government business. It airs Sundays at 7 a.m. on CBS-affiliate WUSA9, a local station serving the D.C.

" DynCorp International is featured in an article in the October 2012 issue of Military Logistics Forum. The article addresses the challenges associated with streamlining maintenance logistics and offers perspectives and best practices from defense industry professionals. Kenneth Juergens, DynCorp International group vice president, Global Logistics and Development Solutions, describes DI’s methodologies in maintenance logistics. “We use a variety of different maintenance methodologies in our work with the U.S. military,” said Kenneth Juergens, a group vice president at DynCorp International. “We often use high-velocity maintenance for scheduled services. For unscheduled maintenance, we often use predictive models including conditioned based maintenance. Sometimes we are able to take an approach that blends more than one maintenance methodology.” In the article, high-velocity maintenance is described as a methodology “usually associated with depot-level overhauls of equipment, in which the condition of the equipment is known before it reaches the depot and the maintenance to be performed involves routine, repeatable steps at which the maintainers are highly skilled.” DynCorp International team members support critical military base operations as well as vehicle and ground support equipment needs globally with end-to-end professional services and technical support.

" DynCorp International received a grade of “A” in Transparency International’s first-ever 2012 Defence Companies Anti-Corruption Index based on a review of the company’s combined internal and public information and programs. The index provides an analysis of more than 120 defense companies’ efforts to prevent corruption. The global study grades companies from A to F depending their anti-corruption systems and processes. Based on DynCorp International’s anti-corruption systems, Transparency International gave DI an “A” grade, based on the following criteria: DI team members are committed to fostering a strong values-based culture, adhering to core values – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform and We Do the Right Thing – as well as a social contract and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.

" Casals & Associates, a DynCorp International company, as an implementing partner in the Foti Timor-Leste Project, continues to sharpen skills of non-state actors in Timor-Leste in their fight against corruption. The Foti Timor-Leste Project is a Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Threshold Anticorruption Project, funded and administered by USAID in partnership with the Government of Timor-Leste. The non-state actors’ component of the program, among other activities, includes training Timorese journalists to strengthen their investigative reporting skills through a specialized training course. The overall objective of the seven-month course is to mainstream corruption-related news coverage to encourage mass participation in Timor-Leste’s anticorruption program and raise awareness of anti-corruption activities. Casals & Associates has carried out four sessions in 2012 with more than 25 participants in each class including editors and reporters from various newspapers, radio and television stations. Attendees are trained to identify compelling stories and how to fearlessly report in a way to generate public debate that helps combat corruption.  Program advisors trained journalists on various topics including data gathering, source verification, meaning and intent of investigative journalism, and the forming of hypotheses to investigate a story. These topics are part of a module tailored to empower editors and reporters to dig deep into corruption stories without solely relying on human sources, gain confidence in their reporting and avoid lawsuits for reporting stories on corruption. Training sessions aim to be interactive between facilitators and participants. In previous sessions, participants asked critical questions that lead to in-depth explanations and facilitators used real-life situations with illustrations that are applicable within the Timorese context. Investigative reporting was almost nonexistent in the Timor-Leste media in 2010. Many reporters and media outlets were afraid to venture into reporting corruption for fear of legal repercussions, but with investigative journalism training underway, local journalists are growing more confident. The media landscape, particularly newspapers, is experiencing a dramatic improvement in the number of corruption stories leading to critical questions from other sectors of society. Reporters are going beyond waiting for interviews to writing news headlines that are generating public debates. Not only are there more corruption stories in newspapers and on radio stations, but the quality of news stories have also improved over time. “News reports are generating discussions on corrupt practices among Timorese from all walks of life. About a year ago there were very few stories about corruption that went beyond vague accusations,” said Brian Pinkowski, Casals & Associates chief of party, Timor-Leste. “Reporters are also making maximum use of the internet to get stories to the public that might be discarded by editors for fear of retaliation.   Reports that media institutions find too sensitive are making their way to the internet through reporters who want to keep discussion alive on particular stories they consider newsworthy.”",Public

" The Air Force’s C-130 Programmed Depot Maintenance Team at Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Ga. was awarded the Department of Defense’s 2012 Robert T. Mason Depot Maintenance Excellence Award. DynCorp International supports this program through a task order under the Contract Field Teams (CFT) contract. According to the Armed Forces Press Service, the team was recognized because “the team increased C-130 aircraft availability by returning 64 aircraft to operating units, reduced in-progress work from 41 to 36 aircraft, slashed flow days from 102 to 69 days, achieved 100 percent on-time delivery by the end of the fiscal year, and lowered customer-reported deficiencies by 60 percent despite increased operational and repair demands on the aging C-130 fleet.” The team’s expanded use of dedicated crews, high-velocity maintenance concepts and consolidation of widely scattered production facilities, also made it stand out against other depot maintenance team in the military. “This is the Super Bowl of depot maintenance,” commented Brigadier General Cedric George, commander of the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex. “We have the best production line in the entire DOD, and that’s tough competition,” George said. “It’s yet another example of what can happen when we work together as a team.” “The world’s finest aircraft maintainers work on the Robins flight line, and receiving the prestigious Robert Mason trophy is testament to the maintenance professionalism of not only our C-130 production team, but our entire 402nd Aircraft Maintenance Group,” said Col. Tim Molnar, 402nd Aircraft Maintenance Group commander. A trophy will be presented to the Robins leadership on November 15, 2012 at the annual Department of Defense Maintenance Symposium at the DeVos Place Convention Center in Grand Rapids, Mich. DynCorp International supports the U.S. Air Force (USAF) through a task order under the Contract Field Teams (CFT) contract to provide aircraft maintenance support at Robins AFB in Georgia.

Several updates to the playground have been made as well, including installing new playground equipment and a small amphitheater, and adding new topsoil. To help prepare for the new school year, DI team members built donation boxes and placed them throughout the KFOR Camp to collect school supplies for the center, and donated supplies directly to the children at the center. The Women’s and Children’s Wellness Center was founded in 2001 and is located on Camp Film City in Pristina, Kosovo. The center is run solely by volunteers and operates on donations from the Camp Film City personnel.

" When a local Women and Children’s Center in Pristina, Kosovo needed repairs, DynCorp International’s team working in support of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), extended a helping hand. Weather conditions had caused many of the Center’s water pipes to burst within the concrete walls causing damage that needed immediate repair. As volunteers, the DI team quickly sent a plumber to investigate the damage and assess reconstruction needs. Over the next few days, DI team members worked to tear apart the walls, install new water pipes and rebuild the concrete walls. Ira Queen, program manager, commented, “We wanted to give back to the Kosovo community by helping with the Women and Children’s Center. Donating work hours to help rebuild the facility was a simple and easy way to show how DI serves the community in which it lives and works, and how we care about the citizens of the community.” The Women and Children’s Wellness Center is staffed by volunteers and is funded solely through donations, many of which come from the military personnel serving at Camp Film City. Nearly 50 children are cared for at the center, ranging in ages from four to 16 years old. Most of the children have been orphaned as a result of the war and rely exclusively on the Center’s support. The Center also helps provide the local communities with clothing and food. DCH, a wholly-owned DI subsidiary formed in 2007, furnishes all labor, services and materials necessary to operate, maintain, repair and alter of facilities and related systems and equipment located at HQ KFOR Main on Film City in Pristina, Kosovo and sub-sites located throughout Kosovo.",Public
" Two DynCorp International team members were recognized in the Profiles in Diversity Journal’s 2012 “Women Worth Watching” issue, which showcases female executives working in global companies and features a celebration of Hispanic Heritage month. “This annual issue is designed to highlight and award companies that support and promote women in leadership. This award is shared with the women executives that have demonstrated outstanding achievement and leadership in their careers,” said CEO and publisher, James R. Rector. Nearly 200 women from all industries are featured in the special issue, with each profile discussing the role of education in their careers. Ashley Burke, who was selected as one of the “Women Worth Watching,” currently serves as vice president of communications for DynCorp International, also serving as the company’s spokesperson.  Burke also leads the Company’s internal and external communications efforts and corporate social responsibility programs and volunteer efforts. Burke has worked in communications for more than 15 years, previously serving as an executive vice president at Prism Public Affairs and communications director at the Entertainment Software Association. “With just four percent of the companies on this year’s Fortune 500 list led by female CEOs, the paucity of women in corporate leadership positions is evidence that the advancement of women in the workplace is an issue of great debate,” said Burke in her profile. On the issue of encouraging future women leaders, Burke commented, “It is incumbent upon all of us to work within our families and communities to ensure that future generations of women see themselves as natural leaders and inherently believe that professional ambition isn’t gender specific.” Profiles in Diversity Journal also highlights Hispanic Heritage Month, examining the current challenges facing the Hispanic and Latino community. Education, jobs, language barriers, issues of assimilation and overcoming stereotypes are all factors that are faced as the Hispanic community continues to grow. Hannah Breshin-Otero, who is highlighted as a noteworthy leader in the Hispanic Heritage feature, is senior counsel for labor and employment at DI and manages labor and employment matters for DI team members worldwide. Prior to joining DI, she was an attorney with the international law firms of Jones Day and Paul Hastings in Washington, D.C., and she also clerked for The Honorable Héctor M.

Breshin-Otero currently serves on the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) Legal Education Fund’s Board of Directors. “My long-time and active involvement with the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) has been invaluable,” commented Breshin-Otero. “It’s a great organization serving an important mission with an impressive network of professionals.” When asked what kind of advice she would give to the next generation of Hispanic/Latino business leaders, she said, “Work hard and remain true to yourself. Remember to give back to your community and mentor those behind you.” Profiles in Diversity Journal, now in its 14th year, is a bi-monthly magazine focusing on diversity/inclusion in business, government, non-profit, higher education and military settings.

" The Salvadoran undersecretary of transparency and anticorruption collaborated with the presidential innovation technology unit in El Salvador to launch the first Virtual Government Training Program (VGTP) on August 17, 2012. The event, held at the training facilities located at the Salvadoran presidential building, was held to kick off a country-wide initiative to provide training for more than 250,000 Salvadoran government officials. The initiative is sponsored by USAID’s Democracy Strengthening Program (DSP) and implemented by DynCorp International in El Salvador. DI team members provided the necessary technical assistance to develop the training program software and the large-capacity host server. VGTP incorporates advanced interactive technologies that engage public sector trainees by allowing system administrators to view updated training statistics by institutions and to track course completion records. Trainees become actively involved in the learning experience, allowing for easier information assimilation in a shorter amount of time. With a virtual program accessible to users nationwide, training costs also decrease and information is able to be re-accessed at a later date. All Salvadoran public officials will have access to online training courses in ethics, transparency, anticorruption, citizen participation, access to information and other courses developed to improve the knowledge and capabilities of all public sector employees. Planning is underway for similar training programs customized for agencies and institutions such as the Government Ethics Tribunal, the Attorney General Office, the Court of Accounts, the Supreme Court of Justice, private sector entities, civil society organizations and the general Salvadoran population. VGTP may potentially be used in the future as an innovative tool to host surveys, disseminate public policies and to periodically share, through the official government website (Transparencia Activa), the compliance status of government agencies with the Access to Information Law. An additional and important feature of the VTGP is that it will directly benefit El Salvador’s compliance with the international anticorruption conventions of the Organization of American States (OAS) and the United Nations (UN). DynCorp International, through Casals & Associates, works as an implementing partner with USAID on the Democracy Strengthening Program (DSP) in El Salvador.

" DynCorp International sponsored one current and two former DI team members in the 32nd Annual Tin Man Triathlon held July 29 in Honolulu, Hawaii. The triathlon consisted of a 750 meter swim, 40 kilometer bike ride and a 10 kilometer run. Clint Barkley, senior operations coordinator for the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) at DynCorp International, Steve Martin, former DI civilian police advisor and Joel “Andy” Herbst, who previously worked with DI in support of the Department of State’s Civilian Police (CIVPOL) training Program, made up the “DynCorp International Patriots” team. What made this event so significant for the DI Patriots was that Barkley, Martin and Herbst all sustained injuries from serving in Afghanistan or Iraq, and completed their portions of the triathlon with the help of prosthetics. Michael Warren, vice president, Human Resources Employee Assistance Programs, was on-site and encouraged the DI team at transition areas between legs. “We finished. That may sound like a joke, but that is actually a big step for the three of us,” said Martin. “This race is not a ‘beginner’ race, each stage is very challenging. The cheers from the crowd as each of us finished our legs were very rewarding and humbling.” Clint Barkley is a single leg amputee and completed the bike ride portion of the race, using a handbike for the 40 kilometer leg. As a former Marine, he served two tours in Iraq and during his second, was injured and lost his leg above the knee. “Events like the Tin Man allow us to demonstrate to ourselves and to others that, although we may face serious obstacles in our lives, we can persevere over those limitations and accomplish great things,” said Barkley of the experience. “Participating in the Tin Man Triathlon gave me a great sense of purpose and accomplishment.” While serving in Afghanistan an improvised explosive device (IED) struck his vehicle, causing him to lose both of his legs. Martin is now back on duty with the Arizona Highway Patrol and competes in marathons to stay in shape. “Doings things like this triathlon are incredibly important to help in the recovery process. Learning how to walk again was a challenge in itself, but taking that next step and competing again is a huge boost to the self-confidence of everyone involved,” said Martin. “We appreciate DI’s support and hope to participate in more events like this in the future.” Herbst, a single-leg amputee, completed the 750 meter swim. While working in Iraq, Herbst’s vehicle in was struck with an IED and he sustained significant injuries to his left leg. One of the event’s highlights came as Herbst emerged from the water and the crowd responded by cheering enthusiastically. “I can’t thank the individuals at DynCorp International enough for reaching out and allowing me to be a part of this event. Completing this triathlon was so motivating for us and we hope we’ve inspired others with life-changing injuries,” said Herbst. “When Andy came out of the water the crowd went wild cheering for him, but he was so focused on getting his prosthetic leg on he did not realize all the cheering was for him. It was not until people started reaching out to pat him on the back and Michael Warren pointed it out, that Andy knew the crowd was excited not just about all the swimmers coming out of the water, but to see an amputee stepping up and meeting this challenge,” commented Martin.",Public

" DynCorp International advisor Rodney Matthews is committed to excellence in the dining facilities (DFAC) at the Kabul Military Training Center (KMTC), where he mentors members of the Afghan National Army (ANA). Matthews works with the ANA DFAC staff to serve 39,000 meals – breakfast, lunch and dinner – to more than 13,000 ANA personnel daily, while working to improve the overall condition of the DFAC as well as quality of the food served. Matthews came to DI in 2009, after retiring from a 28-year career in the U.S. Army.  He started out as a food service specialist and moved up the ranks to installation food advisor, retiring at the rank of E8 -First Sergeant/Master Sergeant of the company. When he started working with the program, he started with the basics, teaching ANA personnel things that he learned over his years as a cook and food service advisor. “I started a once-a-week class with my translator to teach small bits of information incrementally over time, rather than trying to overwhelm them with a lot all at once. It is about 45 minutes because that’s about the optimum time for me to explain a topic and not interfere with their regular work schedule to feed the troops,” said Matthews. Through these classes, he taught tips and best practices on hygiene, sanitation, health and keeping the DFAC clean while serving food. After four years, Matthews is working successfully with his third ANA food-service company commander, constantly looking to improve the food service program. One area that needed improvement was the installation of ice machines, which are necessary for a DFAC in the high desert.  Matthews recognized the need and spent a significant amount of time working through all the procedures and paperwork to get equipment installed. “Working with the ANA commander, we persisted and eventually got five ice machines installed that provide 500 pounds a day for the troops,” said Matthews. Matthews also focused on improving dining during VIP visits to the training center. “Because we get a lot of VIP visits, I wanted to improve how they set up the meals for them,” he said. “We got proper equipment to make sure the food would stay hot for the VIP dinners, and obtained new uniforms for the cooks and servers.” For Matthews, DFAC improvement remains a work in progress.  “Are there areas  that we still want to improve? Yes,” he said. “That is why in addition to introducing new topics, we regularly have refresher courses to remind DFAC employees of the necessities and to educate the new team members of their obligations.” As the KMTC DFAC continues to progress, Matthews is quick to share credit. “Without the support of DI leadership and the Afghan officers at KMTC, I am not certain we would have made the advances we have.”",Public

Working in 35 countries around the world provides DI with unique opportunities to give back to the communities where team members live and work. One way DynCorp International employees show “We Care” is by working with local organizations such as the USO of Metropolitan Washington, participating in events that benefit active-duty military personnel’s families, and volunteering for Habitat for Humanity. This year DI partnered with the USO-Metro to support “Operation Back to School”, which provided backpacks filled with school supplies to approximately 3,000 local military children in kindergarten through 5th grade. The DI offices in Falls Church and Alexandria, Va. served as drop-off locations for school supply donations, and employees then volunteered to help stuff and distribute the backpacks. Members of the DynCorp International Intelligence Training & Solutions business area team volunteer at a local Habitat for Humanity ReStore. The store accepts donations of new and gently-used building materials, sells them to the public at below retail price, and applies the proceeds toward the building of Habitat for Humanity homes. DynCorp International employees also show “We Care” by supporting U.S. troops in Afghanistan through their work with the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP). Earlier this year, DI’s Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) team organized great activities for those serving in Afghanistan. At FOB Zangabad, for example, the MWR team kept the members of the military who are stationed there entertained with a karaoke night, video game tournaments, and their own weight lifting competition. DynCorp International’s collective efforts to give back led to a nomination for the 2012 Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year award from the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. Developing an overall company culture based on core values is a priority to DI team members and is often seen as a perk for those seeking a career with DynCorp International. Not only are employees given opportunities to succeed at their jobs, but also to contribute to local communities.

" DynCorp International was honored to participate in the 2012 Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT), July 6-8, hosted by the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust Enterprises.  RIAT is the world’s largest military air show held at the Royal Air Force (RAF) in Fairford, Gloucestershire, U.K. This year, RIAT joined national and international celebrations marking Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee – commemorating her 60-year reign. RIAT special guests included: His Royal Highness (HRH) the Duke of Gloucester; HRH Lieutenant General Prince Feisal bin Hussein of Jordan, Patron of the Air Tattoo’s Flying Scholarships for Disabled People; Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton; Gen Norton A. Schwartz, Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force; the Right Honourable Philip Hammond, Secretary of State for Defence; and General Sung Il Hwan, Korea’s Chief of Air Staff. DI’s hospitality booth hosted nearly 100 VIP visitors during the three-day event. “The atmosphere provided at RIAT created an excellent opportunity to interact one-on-one with our customers and guests. Guests didn’t need an invitation and that provided a comfortable and more flexible schedule for those we hosted,” said Cliff Cagle, vice president, Advanced Programs, DynCorp International. Air Tattoo chief executive Tim Prince commented, “This has been a challenging year, but the great British public, and our overseas visitors, have supported us as they always do. We warmly welcomed our new visitors from Japan, South Korea and Colombia, who have helped the Air Tattoo maintain its reputation as one of the greatest international military air shows, and we continue to be grateful for the fantastic support from the RAF and the United States Air Force, who continue to see the benefits the Air Tattoo brings in terms of defence diplomacy.” Despite inclement weather, more than 130,000 visitors attended the air show. Held annually each July at RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, the Royal International Air Tattoo, the world’s largest military airshow, has gained the well-earned reputation as one of the UK’s top outdoor events.",Public
" Michael Vane, DynCorp International group vice president for Training & Intelligence Solutions, was featured on The Frank Gaffney Show on Secure Freedom Radio, where he discussed the role of contractors in U.S. defense, diplomacy and development efforts. Described as the “unsung heroes” of U.S. operations overseas, contractor personnel serve the U.S. mission alongside military personnel in oftentimes austere environments. “We  have extremely courageous employees who serve at the direction of their government and nearly each and every one of those people has a sense of purpose greater than themselves,” commented Vane. In light of recent public debate about the importance of U.S. access to intelligence in certain areas of the world, such as Syria, Vane also described how DI supports the U.S. government with Training & Intelligence Solutions. “A couple of key capabilities that we at DynCorp provide to the government that are very ‘apropos’ in such a set of circumstances are document exploitation, the analysis of open source and other kinds of documents, as well as an increasingly important area called cultural intelligence,” Vane added. Vane also generally spoke about some of the important training and mentoring work DynCorp International is doing in Afghanistan. “In conjunction with our government customer and many of their activities, we have been providing training and mentoring support in six principal areas through two big categories, which are the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior. Each one of those has three separate subcategories from initial institutional training to staff training to deploying people in the field,” said Vane.",Public
" DynCorp International was a proud sponsor of this year’s USO-Metro Operation Back to School. The program provides backpacks complete with school supplies to approximately 4,000 local military children in kindergarten through fifth grade. DI participated in all three phases of this year’s program by collecting supply donations, volunteering to stuff backpacks with supplies and then volunteering at the final events held at Fort Belvoir and Fort Meade. The first phase of “Operation Back to School” involved donating school supplies throughout the month of May at DI offices in Falls Church, Va. and Alexandria, Va. Team members donated markers, crayons, composition notebooks, pencil holders, scissors, glue sticks and pencil sharpeners to this great cause. Several DI team members also volunteered their time to join other USO volunteers at the USO warehouse located on Fort Belvoir to fill backpacks with school supplies. Two large assembly lines worked together to add tags to the backpacks, stuff each with donated supplies and prepare for distribution at both Operation Back to School events. Then, on August 4, nearly 40 DI employees participated in Operation Back to School backpack distribution events at Fort Belvoir and Fort Meade.  Volunteers set up stations with fun activities that incorporated core subjects such as reading, math, science, history, art and physical education. Upon registration, the “students” received a report card listing each subject to be stamped upon completion at each station. After completing all stations they presented their report cards to receive a USO backpack filled with school supplies. Operation Back to School not only aims to excite children about preparing for the upcoming school year, but it also assists with the costs of school supplies, which can often put a financial strain on a family, especially when they have more than one child. USO-Metro is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization chartered by Congress, and dedicated to “serving those who serve, and their families” in Washington D.C., Maryland and Northern Virginia.  It is through the generous financial support of individuals and organizations in the local community that USO-Metro is able to fulfill its mission.

"  Russell McCray, DynCorp International advisor/mentor working in support of the Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (CSTC-A) program, was the featured guest speaker at a ceremony celebrating the U.S. Army’s 237th birthday. The ceremony, which included a cake-cutting and remarks from coalition leaders, was held at Camp Eggers in Kabul, Afghanistan. In his speech, McCray, a retired Army Command Sergeant Major, described what it personally meant for him to serve and how Army experience strengthens each soldier’s character. “In my opinion, serving one’s country is a noble calling and I believe it is one of life’s greatest works. Nothing illustrates one’s commitment to their country more than putting on your boots and answering the call to serve whenever and wherever you are needed,” McCray said. Visit the NTM-A website to view a  video of the ceremony. As an advisor/mentor with DI, McCray now works in conjunction with U.S. and NATO coalition uniformed personnel, advising and mentoring the Afghan National Army (ANA) Sergeants Major Academy Commander and staff as they develop senior non-commissioned officers for the ANA. He also advises ANA instructors on how to train and instruct more than 45 military subject areas relevant to the continued development of the ANA non-commissioned officers (NCOs) corps. After he retired, McCray wanted to continue to develop Afghan forces as an advisor/mentor. “My last duty assignment in Afghanistan was working to develop ANA NCOs.  That assignment afforded me the opportunity to work with some outstanding civilian contractors, particularly those I had the pleasure of working beside every day. What I realized during that time was that contractors can truly enhance the military’s ability to successfully accomplish their mission,” McCray commented. “I valued the advice and counsel of a retired sergeant major, because I was able to consult with someone who had similar experience.  I hope that during my time with DI, I will be able to do the same for someone else.” McCray most recently served in the U.S. Army as Command Sergeant Major (CSM) of the Afghanistan Regional Security Integration Command- South (ARSIC-S) before coming to DI in February 2012. He advised the ARSIC-S commander on the status of more than 655 U.S. and coalition personnel’s conducting combat operation in Southern Afghanistan.  He also served as the advisor for the Afghan National Army 205th Corps CSM and the Afghan National Police, 404th District CSM. McCray’s work with the Afghan National Army Sergeant Major Academy was successful in mentoring several Afghan National Security Force senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs).  McCray and his team conducted extensive one-on-one mentorship and training in the areas of administration, logistics, operations, instructional technique, counseling, leadership, and standard operating procedures (SOP) development.",Public

" DynCorp International personnel working in support of the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP), recently worked together to help support a full and half marathon held on Forward Operating Base (FOB) Tarin Kowt in southern Afghanistan, benefiting the Wounded Warrior Project. The races were co-hosted by DI’s Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) and Material Handling Equipment (MHE) teams and sponsored by the Australian Physical Training Instructors (PTI), who also work at FOB Tarin Kowt. The marathon, held May 18, had more than 200 participants including DI personnel alongside U.S., Australian, Singaporean and other UN military troops. The MWR department provided medals, sports drinks and event personnel support at water and first-aid stations along the race’s route. Road support was managed by the MHE department to ensure safe conditions for racers, keeping the roads clean and smooth. At the end of the day, more than $2,000 in proceeds were raised to be split between the Wounded Warrior Project and Legacy, a non-profit organization in Australia. “Our MWR teams aim to make a difference in the lives of our servicemen and women while they are deployed so far from home. With collaborative events like this, we hope we can make a difference in their lives after deployment as well!” said Chris Baker, MWR technician. The mission of Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) is to honor and empower wounded warriors.

" DynCorp International’s team that supports the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, (CAL FIRE), is playing an instrumental role in helping to contain the Robbers fire, a fire covering more than 2,500 acres in northern California. DynCorp International supports CAL FIRE by providing fleet management for the aircraft as well as pilots. CAL FIRE’s efforts in fighting the Robbers fire have even broken a record for most drops of retardant dropped by air tankers in a single day. As featured by KCRA News, CAL FIRE spokesman Daniel Berlant said air tankers set the record after dropping a total of 109 loads of fire retardant on the blaze last Thursday. During the operation, pilots worked quickly skillfully around the difficult terrain to maneuver the air tankers, which can carry up to 1,200 gallons of fire retardant per trip. Joe Satrapa, DynCorp International air tanker pilot for CAL FIRE, made 17 retardant drops on the record-breaking day, while Jim Ferreira added 18 drops and Brad Baker delivered 21. “Sometimes you have a steep canyon wall, and you have to decide, ‘Is it better to turn to the right, to the left, or do the drop in a turn so I can avoid that sheer cliff?'” said Satrapa. The Robbers fire is expected to be fully contained by Saturday. DynCorp International has worked with CAL FIRE since 2001 helping suppress and control wild land fires in California. As part of the program, DI flies and maintains Grumman S-2T fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft, and fully maintains and services civilian UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots. Operating from across California, aircraft can reach most fires within 20 minutes. The OV-10A aircraft fly over fires, directing the air tankers and helicopters to critical areas for retardant and water drops. The retardant used to slow or retard the spread of a fire is a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum-thickening agent, and a coloring agent. While both airtankers and helicopters are equipped to carry fire retardant or water, the helicopters can also transport firefighters, equipment and injured personnel. All CAL FIRE Aircraft are strategically located throughout the state at airbases and helicopter bases. During high fire activity, CAL FIRE may move aircraft to better provide statewide air support. The department’s firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft respond to an average of more than 5,600 wildland fires each year. Those fires burn more than 172,000 acres annually.",Public
" As part of DynCorp International’s work in support of the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP), the Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) team organizes great activities for troops serving in Afghanistan. On Easter, the dining facilities (DFAC) team at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Spin Boldak brought a taste of home to the resident warfighters with a traditional Easter dinner. The dinner menu included ham, grilled Cornish hens, candied yams, a fruit display and typical Easter basket treats. The dining area was also decorated festively, with spring flowers and linen tablecloths. MWR personnel organized a unique bench press competition at Camp Stone. The goal for the competitors was to lift 80 percent of their body weight as many times as they could without raising any part of their body off the weight bench. Winners were divided by division – light weight, middle weight and heavy weight – and earned fun prizes while a mix of soldiers, coalition forces and DI personnel cheered them on. The MWR team at FOB Zangabad kept the members of the military who are stationed there entertained in May with a karaoke night, video game tournaments, and their own weight lifting competition.

" DynCorp International is featured in an article in the July 2012 issue of Military Logistics Forum. The article highlights DI’s innovative supply chain model which combines proprietary technology and concentrated supply chain operations into a system that is being used to fulfill supply needs for all the company’s customers. DI’s Eric George, senior vice president, Supply Chain, discusses the model and explains its functionality. “We were able to put a supply chain in place that [incorporates] the entire [supply] life cycle,” said George. “It’s the entire piece, not just one thing. I would say we have a very progressive idea of what a supply chain is. It’s truly the whole gambit of everything a company would need to buy in terms of services all the way to endgame of the delivery.” DI’s Supply Chain revolves around a centralized Supply Chain Center of Excellence (COE), allowing a consistent source of controls and logistics for the entire Company’s needs. The COE manages cost analytics, e-sourcing and targeted sourcing, ultimately providing cost savings for customers. The article highlights the importance of leveraging a unified supply chain effort in cutting costs.  Supply efforts are also evaluated through a supplier rating system to ensure efficient supply management, which George says provides “exponential improvements in procurement.” DI’s senior leadership also reviews these scorecards monthly for individual companies, and performance updates are provided to suppliers as needed. The article also describes the DI supply chain “hub and spoke distribution operation” – a system that consolidates supply transport and quality control at two Quality Control Centers (QCCs), one in Texas and another in Dubai.  QCC personnel manage all materials received, perform inspections and ship to appropriate customer locations worldwide. DynCorp International’s Supply Chain model has been cited as a positive factor in streamlining processes and plays a key role in protecting core businesses, delivering existing capabilities to new customers, and delivering new capabilities to existing customers.

" Throughout his career, DynCorp International mentor, Frank Partyka, has always been very safety-focused.  When he became a range control mentor at the Kabul Military Training Center (KMTC)  in 2010, responsible for training Afghan army personnel, his attention to safety became all the more valued. Partyka retired from the U.S. military in 1996 after 22 years in the U.S. Army where he served as a master sergeant, and learned the importance of setting up and running facilities safely. As a civilian, he brings experience from working as a mentor with army personnel in Bosnia and Macedonia as well as serving as an observer controller for the U.S. task force as a trainer in Kuwait and a civilian brigade combat team safety specialist. Working in support of the Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (CSTC-A) program, Partyka currently works with four Afghan officers, 20 non-commissioned officers and 19 soldiers. “Safety is our highest priority.  We instituted a mission statement and mission-essential task list that emphasizes safety as well as a risk management process,” said Partyka. Partyka also focused on airspace management over KMTC, coordinating with the Kabul International Airport (KAIA), and helping the Afghan range control personnel improve monitoring and record-keeping skills. “It’s important to develop a culture of safety, where information is passed on. This way, everyone is aware of responsibilities, regardless of who is assigned what position,” said Partyka. During his time at KMTC, he also instituted a range certification process that includes granting a certification card to those who are properly trained.  So far, more than 10,000 personnel have been certified for KMTC ranges, including both Afghan and coalition forces. Working with Afghan partners, Partyka created a KMTC Range Control Regulation document, now being considered as the model for other ranges throughout the nation. “Everything I do, I do in conjunction my Afghan colleagues,” Partyka commented. “It’s important for me to share my experience and incorporate that with factors they support, based on their rules and regulations.” Partyka also emphasized the importance of personal and professional development, especially for the range control team, ultimately resulting in better performance in completing their mission. “We embrace opportunities to send personnel to professional development courses and continue their studies in Dari. In the end, it makes for not just better soldiers, but better people to serve Afghanistan,” said Partyka.",Public

" Under the watchful eye of their instructor, three Afghan National Army (ANA) non-commissioned officers (NCOs) stand hunched over a grid with their protractors, graphics templates and markers. Winston Clough, DynCorp International advisor/mentor on the Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (CSTC-A) program, observes their progress from across the room.  The scene is a course at the Kabul Military Training Center (KMTC), the ANA’s premier facility for training. Clough, known as a no-nonsense instructor, has helped develop the course into what it is today. Before he joined DI, Clough served as Command Sergeant Major of the U.S. Army’s Fifth Special Forces Group. After obtaining a degree in history with a minor in political science, he was a teacher. It was this combination of military training and teaching experience that led to his eventual return to Afghanistan. “I left the teaching profession when one of my former group commanders called me” Clough recalls.  Clough’s former commander, who was at the time working for DynCorp International, told him about work the Company was doing to support training efforts in Afghanistan and asked him to come on board. Clough and his DI colleagues, their Afghan counterparts and the Company’s customer, the Department of Defense, all worked together to improve the program, increasing its impact, resulting in a higher graduation rate of Afghan trainees. “Our graduation rate varies, but generally it’s over 90 percent,” said Clough. Course requirements include being able to coordinate terrain features and measure map distances on grids. “We train our students in how to construct overlays, adjoin map sheets and how to give military briefings.  By the end of the course, they can construct a terrain model, and we have them brief the training model that they created. Finally, in the past year, we’ve added troop leading procedures and the military decision-making process, which is a very complex subject for soldiers in any Army.  Our students do remarkably well.” One of the course’s Afghan graduates recently reported on the practical and useful knowledge he gained from the course. When he went back into the field, he overheard his officers discussing a problem that had stymied them, and knew he could help with his newfound knowledge. The graduate was able to bring to his team a new level of problem solving and, thanks to the knowledge gained in the course, he was promoted on the spot.",Public

" DynCorp International senior financial director, Evonne Ruiz, is highlighted in the Summer/Fall issue of Hispanic Career World Magazine. In an article entitled “Serving Your Country: Careers in Government and Defense Contracting,” Sandra H. Shichtman profiled four individuals who have developed careers within the government or defense contracting. Growing up in the Texas Rio Grande Valley, Ruiz thought she would follow her family tradition and work in pharmaceuticals. However, she found finance and accounting to be more her calling and switched her major at the University of Texas- Austin accordingly. On the recommendation of one of her college counselors who had sent other students to the Company in the past, Ruiz came to DI as an intern. She worked the summer between her junior and senior years and then continued as a part-time employee until her graduation in December 1998. Her role as an intern included basic accounting tasks such as: reconciling accounts, balance sheets and cash accounts. Her hard work paid off and after graduation she was hired as a full-time accountant.  Since then she has moved up the ranks to her current role as senior financial director where she currently handles high-level tasks such as forecasting, budgets, and operating plan financials for all of DynCorp International’s government operations. Ruiz’s says the most challenging aspect of the job is staying abreast of financial issues that might impact a company that operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Ruiz is driven in all she does by the Company’s mission to provide quality services to the U.S. government. This includes not only her accounting work but also her excellent communication skills, people skills, and flexibility as she works with personnel across the globe. She credits the help and understanding of her husband to balance such a challenging business role with her personal life.

DI provides aircraft maintenance support for the 80th Flying Training Wing at Sheppard AFB. The mission of the Air Education and Training Command’s (AETC) 80th Flying Wing is unique, providing undergraduate pilot training for the U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies in the Euro NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training program (ENJJPT).

" DynCorp International recently donated $10,000 to the Special Operations Warrior Foundation (SOWF) by sponsoring the Tribute to Special Operations Forces event held May 3. Donations from this event directly benefit SOWF programs that provide support and assistance to families of personnel serving in the U.S. Special Operations Command. The Special Operations Warrior Foundation was founded in 1980 and strives to relieve special operations personnel of the concerns involving their families while they serve their missions. The foundation made a pledge and a commitment to all the men and women serving in U.S. special operations that if they lose their life in combat or training, the SOWF will provide a post-secondary education for all of their surviving children. Another of SOWF’s initiatives is to help families reach their wounded family members in the case of injury. Although there are numerous charities and other organizations that assist military personnel wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, SOWF has learned that one of the most important challenges special operations families face is getting to their hospitalized loved ones as quickly as possible. SOWF fulfills this need by providing $2,000 immediately to family members, solely for travel purposes. To date, the SOWF has provided more than $1.4 million to the families of severely wounded special operations personnel. 125 sons and daughters of fallen Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps special operators are currently enrolled in colleges and universities across the country with funding from SOWF, made possible by generous donations from organizations like DynCorp International. Also, 201 sons and daughters of fallen special operations forces personnel have graduated from colleges, universities or vocational schools with SOWF’s assistance.

" DynCorp International has been awarded the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) prestigious Diamond Award for Excellence for its support of two U.S. Air Force programs, the C-21A Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) team and the C-20 program. The C-21A CLS has earned this award for four years consecutively, while this is the C-20 program’s first. Through these programs, DI maintains LearJet 35A, Gulfstream III and Gulfstream IV distinguished visitor airlift aircraft at 12 different operating locations globally. The FAA’s Aviation Maintenance Technician (AMT) Award program is based on the commitment of maintenance technicians to improve safety by actively participating in initial and recurring training programs to further their technical knowledge. The Diamond Award is the highest corporate award, and the program includes both individual and corporate recognition. The award recognizes completion by 100-percent of an organization’s eligible maintenance technicians of specialized, continuous training in aircraft systems, regulations and FAA rules over a 12-month period. In addition to the Diamond Award, which is presented to the company, each mechanic receives an Aviation Maintenance Technician award based on the number of training hours logged. “The award recognizes our dedication to continuous training and employee development,” said Jeffrey Roth, C-21A CLS program director. “With multiple operating locations, this is an additional measure to baseline and improves our training process. To be recognized for our training commitment by the FAA with their highest award for four straight years is significant.” “Truly a team effort, the FAA Diamond Award means a great deal to the program team,” Duane Carr, C-20 program manager said. “It’s a means for us to invest in our employees and demonstrate our dedication and commitment to providing highly trained team members for our customer.” John Nix, vice president of DI’s U.S. Air Force and Navy Aviation business area, congratulated both the C-20 and C-21A teams for their achievement. “For more than 60 years, DI has been known for aviation excellence, and safety and training are the cornerstones of that reputation.

These interventions also provide information for parents on how to continue to help their children when they return home from camp. The camps themselves are free of charge to children and family members of active military, utilize highly trained counselors, and provide an atmosphere of acceptance and understanding. As their website states, “Camp C.O.P.E. allows the child to tell their story and help put a voice to their feelings and concerns, while producing new ways to handle their experiences.”  One of their basic core values is “Kids Serve, Too!” The Taste of the South (TOTS) was founded in 1982 by southerners who had relocated to Washington, D.C., from Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.  Wanting to share their traditions with new friends as well as each other, the group held their first party for $15 a ticket and then donated the proceeds to a southern-based charity. Donations grew year after year, and even during tough economic times the group was able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to give away. In 2003, TOTS created the “Dixie Fund” to earmark funds from the annual event toward the charity of choice of one of its member states. Camp C.O.P.E. is this year’s designated charity.",Public

A Brush with Kindness helps low-income homeowners impacted by age, disability and family circumstances, who struggle to maintain the exterior of their homes, reclaim their homes with pride and dignity. A Brush with Kindness serves as a companion to local affiliates’ core building services, enabling them to serve more families and increase opportunities for volunteers and sponsors.

" DynCorp International employees not only work in support of U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives all over the world, but are also making a difference in the communities where they live and work. DI maintenance test pilot Bob Joffrion, along with his wife Liz, live the DI core values – We serve, We care, We empower, We perform and We do the right thing – in Kuwait.  For more than five years they have contributed to the local community, including as volunteers with the American Red Cross. Third Army Commander Lieutenant General Brooks and 1st Theater Sustainment Commander Major General Dowd recently recognized Liz for her outstanding service to the U.S. Army community. The Joffrions found a special way to make a contribution through their dogs, Apollo and Athena, who serve as therapy dogs. The Cairn terriers are certified by Therapy Dogs International and have the distinction of being the only dogs in the American Red Cross Therapy Dog Program in the Middle East. As a team, they visit Camp Arifjan, where they visit the hospital, the Behavioral Health Clinic, and the American Red Cross Resiliency and Wellness Centers, which provide counseling and pet therapy. The canines are popular visitors who are able to relieve stress for soldiers coping with pre-deployment and redeployment. Therapy dogs have popular for several decades, since the Therapy Dogs International (TDI) program started in New Jersey in 1976. They are now used around the world as four-legged ambassadors of hope. First used in nursing homes, therapy dogs showed an amazing ability to calm patients and bond with them. Currently, therapy dogs are used in disaster stress relief, such as after September 11, 2001, hospices, reading programs in schools and libraries and even in calming families as they lose loved ones. Therapy dogs are trained by TDI or other similar organizations. Any breed and size of dog is welcome in the program, but the animals must have stable temperaments and work well with other dogs. When dog handlers, typically the owners, want to volunteer their pet, TDI tests the animal with their handler to see how the team reacts to stress. The Therapy Dog Program is one of the ways that Red Cross provides a link to home for soldiers serving in Kuwait.",Public
" DynCorp International sponsored the DynCorp International Small Business Outreach event held earlier this month at the Iowa State University Scott County Extension Office in Bettendorf, Iowa along with the Illinois Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) at Black Hawk College. Attendees learned about DynCorp International’s business, how organizations can partner to provide services to DynCorp International customers and meet one-on-one with DI’s Small Business team. “We strategically held the event in close proximity to our U.S. Army customer at Rock Island Arsenal to target and engage small businesses who already know and support the U.S Army. There were more than 40 small businesses in attendance and we discussed details about DI business, our mission, and shared current and upcoming opportunities for small businesses within our organization.  Each small business had an opportunity to meet with PTAC representatives, DI’s Small Business team, and DI’s Business Development team during matchmaking sessions,” said Debbie Newberry, senior manager, small business, at DynCorp International. “The ‘matchmaking’ session was very valuable as members looked forward to one-on-one mentoring with DynCorp International Small Business Office experts. Attendees raved about that session,” commented Vicky Miller, director, Illinois PTAC. Small businesses in the following fields attended: DynCorp International’s Small Business Office identifies outstanding small business partners that work as subcontractors through outreach programs and targeted events. Also, as a participant in the Defense Department’s Mentor Protégé program, DI can offer small businesses even more assistance. The Small Business Office currently manages more than 30 contracts in accordance with the U.S. Small Business Administration and the Defense Contract Management Agency. “It is important for DynCorp International to find the right small business partners that can assist in supporting the DI mission. Events such as the DI Small Business Outreach event give us an opportunity to meet with local small business representatives and discuss upcoming opportunities,” said Newberry.

" Representatives from DynCorp International (DI), the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and the local law-enforcement community gathered March 15 in Calhoun, Georgia, to honor Gary Wayne Willard, who was killed while serving as a police advisor in Afghanistan. Elizabeth, his widow, along with daughter Samantha and son Travis, accepted awards from DI and INL in recognition of Willard’s service and sacrifice. David Dobrotka, DI vice president of International Civilian Police (CIVPOL) Training and Mentoring, presented the family with the DynCorp International Chairman’s Valor Award. Walter Redman, the U.S. State Department’s Chief Police Advisor, Office of CIVPOL Program INL, praised Willard’s extraordinary dedication to his country, with this statement: “Gary Wayne Willard was a true American hero who died serving his country. His life-long record of service speaks for itself. He had amazing accomplishments with the Calhoun Police Department and then offered those skills to help train and develop the Afghan National Police. His effort in Afghanistan was to ultimately help secure us here at home in the United States. He served his community – he served his country – he served humanity by advancing the cause of human rights and the rule of law. Gary Wayne Willard was a true American hero.” Melanie Brock, Afghanistan Transition Coordinator, INL, though unable to attend, wrote to commend Willard’s service. Sergeant Major Douglas Simons (USMC Ret.), a former police mentor who also worked in Afghanistan, spoke of the call to service and the importance of Willard’s contribution: “Wayne was my best friend and an outstanding man who left this life doing what he wanted to do, defending this great nation. It is an honor to have served with him. I feel my life is much richer and I am a better person for having known him. Today there are men and women who serve around the world in harm’s way to protect the people of this nation from people who would see fit to destroy everything we stand for. As long as there are people like Wayne, Americans can sleep at night, given the security those like Wayne provide.” A member of the United States Marine Corps, Willard served six years with the Elite Force Reconnaissance Unit, and he spent eight years with the Calhoun Police Department, where he was commander of the Special Response Team and a member of the Northwest Georgia Bomb Squad. DynCorp International recognizes and remembers those who exemplify the spirit and the values of our company.

A small portion of these troops meet their families at the airport in Texas, while the majority will catch connecting flights home. Volunteers gather each day to be there to welcome these troops off their flight, thanking and encouraging them for their service to the U.S. The majority of those arriving are coming from Afghanistan and Iraq. Volunteers typically arrive dressed in red, white and blue with signs of encouragement, balloons and American flags. The USO facility at DFW Airport will continue to serve troops, even after the end of scheduled R&R charter flights. Troops will continue transiting through DFW individually or in groups on their travels between the United States and the theater of operations in the Middle East, and will continue to receive support at DFW. The “Welcome Home a Hero” program has been nationally recognized as a model for civic participation and grew into one of the largest public service projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

" When Phil Bossert, who was working as an advisor to the Afghan Ministry of Defense as part of DynCorp International’s support of the Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (CSTC-A), was diagnosed with a cold and sinus issues, his fellow team members weren’t convinced that was the root of his sickness. “My team at DI as well as the military team in the NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan basically ordered me to stop gutting it out and seek a second opinion at the clinic. In the end, these team members actually helped saved my life,” said Bossert. DynCorp International personnel quickly coordinated for transportation from Kabul, Afghanistan, to Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where it was found that Bossert’s “cold” was actually a brain tumor. After early detection, the tumor was successfully removed and Bossert recovered fully. Bossert credits his successful diagnosis and recovery to the DI teams working Kabul and in the U.S. “My team lead was an exceptional leader whose special operations background was obvious in his people-oriented and mission-focused leadership style. When I was transported to Walter Reed, he immediately shipped all my personal and professional gear to my home in Texas, kept my wife informed, and took over my advising duties without skipping a beat. A fellow advisor loaded my backpack with items that carried me through to Walter Reed. Another colleague escorted me to the clinic and shouted over the roar of the Medevac helicopter rotor blades, ‘Hang in there, Phil; everything is going to be all right,’ which meant a great deal,” said Bossert. Bossert’s program manager supported him by following-up with phone calls to the clinic and then later on during recovery. Bossert also received one-on-one support from the DI Care Employee Assistance Program (EAP). EAP ambassador, Donald Tate, contacted Bossert’s wife and provided constant updates on his condition, while April Spence, human resources, remained in close contact with his family for all their needs.  Michael Warren, VP, Human Resources – Employee Assistance Programs, visited Bossert at home during recovery and answered any questions he and his family had. “DI’s professionalism and its commitment to its values deeply impressed us and made this ordeal bearable. I want to express the deepest appreciation to all those at DynCorp International who helped save my life.  I want to assure DI employees worldwide, especially those in harm’s way, that DI will spare no effort to help them anytime, anywhere, especially if they get hurt or sick,” said Bossert.",Public

" DynCorp International this year showed it support for the families of our soldiers with a $5,000 donation to The Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC). For more than ten years, this global, non-profit organization has focused on its goal to ensure “quality educational opportunities for all military children affected by mobility, family separation, and transition.” Military children face unique challenges. Many move an average of six to nine times while in grade school and some may face being separated from a deployed parent. MCEC’s mission is “to ensure inclusive, quality educational experiences for all military children affected by mobility, family separation, and transition.” MCEC supports military children by performing research, developing resources, conducting professional conferences and developing and publishing resources for the children of servicemen and women, including extended family members. MCEC supports military children by: The Military Child Education Coalition also provides other resources such as “Living in the New Normal,” a program that helps to support the entire family unit throughout the time of a loved one’s military service.

" DynCorp International is sponsoring the 2012 “Bike for the Blue” event, an annual bicycle ride from the state capitol building in Richmond, Va., to the National Law Enforcement Memorial Wall in Washington, D.C. Police officers from several Virginia police departments participate in the event, which serves as a showing of support for law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. DI is sponsoring the ride by providing jerseys for participants and t-shirts for event staff. “This year we will honor the 168 brave men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our way of life. DynCorp International has supported ‘Bike for the Blue’ for three years and continues to be a great supporter of our cause, and we are most grateful,” said Officer Brian Rhodenizer, Chesterfield County Police Department. Rhodenizer worked with DI in Iraq from 2006-2007 as an International Police Advisor in support of the U.S. Civilian Police (CIVPOL) program and is now a yearly participant in the event. “DI’s support of this year’s ride is monumental in making this one of the most successful yet,” said Rhodenizer. The bike ride was organized 11 years ago by a small group of Chesterfield County Police Officers. The ride originally included a small contingent of volunteer riders and has grown into a large annual gathering of officers from Chesterfield County Police Department, Richmond Police Dept., Virginia Tech University Police Dept., Virginia Commonwealth University Police Department, and the Richmond Capitol Police. The ride begins at the Richmond Capitol each year during the morning of May 13. The journey to Washington, D.C. totals 118 miles on northward travel primarily on Route 1, with a lunch break halfway through. A contingent of support staff from all of the participating police departments escort  the officers throughout the ride. The support personnel travel in marked and unmarked vehicles, and provide vehicles and equipment to assist riders. Each jurisdiction also assists by blocking intersections within their jurisdiction so that the ride can continue safely and non-stop straight through to D.C. The ride typically takes 12 to 13 hours, and ends at the National Law Enforcement Memorial Wall located in Washington, D.C.’s Judiciary Square. The ride is completely voluntary, and is completed on the participating officers own time, and at their own expense. The ride will be completed by more than 30 Chesterfield County Police Officers, and an additional 60 to 70 riders from other jurisdictions.",Public

" To help celebrate Valentine’s Day away from home, several of DynCorp International’s Dining Facilities (DFAC) in the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) created heart-felt cuisine and trimmings to share with the troops in Afghanistan. At Forward Operating Base (FOB) Spin Boldak, Valentine’s Day was celebrated during lunch.  The dining room was decorated with red and white balloons and the fare followed the red and white theme with choices like strawberry banana cake, chocolate-covered strawberries, and banana milk shakes. Staff at the FOB Walton dining facility served a Valentine’s Day feast on February 14.  Six hundred chicken breasts were butterflied and 700 lobster tails were prepared and served along with a vegetable medley and pineapple fried rice. Troops enjoyed a dessert spread that consisted of cakes and pastries from the bakery team including red velvet cake and cupcakes topped with heart-shaped candies. As for decorations, a dining facility team member created heart and cupid-shaped figures as well as a 4 by 4-foot centerpiece sign that said “Happy Valentine’s Day.” Another talented team member carved watermelons and honeydew into beautiful, competition-worthy roses and Valentine’s wishes.

" Supporting DynCorp International’s work in the Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (CSTC-A) in Kabul, Afghanistan, Jimmy Earle, Afghan National Army (ANA) Medical Planner Advisor at DynCorp International, helped develop and implement a hospital disaster preparedness plan with NATO Training Mission – Afghanistan (NTM-A) and CSTC-A personnel for the Kandahar Regional Medical Hospital (RMH). “Having the right people do the right things in a medical emergency can make a significant difference. Working out the response processes to the various contingencies likely to occur and committing them to a standard operation procedure allows for consistency in training, setting performance expectations and accountability, and determining logistics issues beforehand,” said Earle. A main component of the plan establishes a training and monitoring program to ensure that all ANA personnel are prepared to properly handle independent operations in the event of an emergency, an integral part of developing any hospital system. The comprehensive training plan included evaluation guides to monitor the effectiveness of training through both simulated and real world events. The contingency plan utilizes methods and standards that are routinely found in western hospitals, while still fitting into current hospital practices. The plan addresses numerous situations and will be a useful, easily accessible resource for all hospital staff. In creating the Kandahar RMH’s plan, Earle facilitated planning meetings with hospital staff and U.S. and Bulgarian medical mentors to decide how to design and fit a plan specific to the RMH and its staff. “The plan is comprehensive and should be used as a model for other Regional Medical Hospitals,” commented Andrew C. Lattimore, Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Air Force.

" Troops at Camp Dwyer in Afghanistan are enjoying meal time a bit more these days thanks to the efforts of five-star chefs Paul and Nick Longobardi. The brothers, who work in DynCorp International’s Project Food Services program as part of the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP), are collaborating to serve up some top quality cuisine, such as chicken sorrentino and Italian-style cheesecake, and love using their talents to help out the soldiers. However, it was a long road getting them to the same place at the same time. Becoming chefs came naturally to Paul and Nick. The two grew up in New Castle, Penn., working together in their father’s Italian restaurants. Later they collaborated at the three-star New Castle Country Club, where Nick worked as executive chef, cooking for celebrities and dignitaries such as Elton John, Michael Jordan, Senator Rick Santorum and even the Prince of Arabia. After the events that took place on September 11, 2001, Paul felt a calling to play his part in supporting his country. After working in various food service positions at several bases in Iraq, his brother Nick decided to join him. Although they were working in separate locations in Iraq, Paul felt a bond through their mutual service to the warfighter. What finally brought the brothers back together was the opportunity to work under DynCorp International’s LOGCAP IV contract. In the beginning, they were both in Afghanistan, but at different camps—Paul at Camp Ramrod and Nick at Camp Payne. However, after about a year and a half, they came together at Camp Dwyer where they currently serve, much to the delight of the military personnel stationed there. Although they have enjoyed cooking for celebrities and dignitaries, Paul and Nick say that they wouldn’t want to be anywhere else but in Afghanistan supporting the troops. Their experiences in the last eight years have given them great appreciation for the military’s work and an even greater appreciation of the individuals who work to complete the U.S. mission. They continue to enjoy the fast pace of the military environment and have helped prepare meals for events such as the U.S. Army’s 236th birthday at Camp Payne and the U.S. Air Force birthday celebration.",Public

" A recent article from Stars and Stripes credits DynCorp International’s heath care provider, Onsite OHS, for saving the life of an Afghan man. Onsite OHS works as a subcontractor with DI to provide health care to team members in Afghanistan. Abdul Aman Hirjartullah, a 26-year-old Afghan trash hauler and father of two, was bitten in the leg by one of the many dogs roaming the country. Fearing that the dog was rabid, Hirjartullah went first to the local bazaar for treatment but none was available. His next stop was Forward Operating Base (FOB) Apache where he encountered OHS Medic Cory Kraus who knew immediately that rabies treatment was needed. Typical rabies treatment involves a tetanus shot, an antibiotic, and a series of Rabivert rabies vaccine, all of which were available and administered. What was not easily obtainable says the article was HRIG, or human rabies immune globulin. The medicine is only available at a few medical facilities in Afghanistan, needs to be handled properly and can cost up to $1,200 per dose. However, Kraus knew that HRIG would be essential in saving Hirjartullah’s life because he had never received an anti-rabies vaccine. Kraus’ supervisor, physician assistant, Bill Weiss of FOB Tarin-Kowt, coordinated with the hospital on Kandahar Air Field that had the medicine. Weiss worked with a colleague at OHS, Mark Caplin, who manages all the OHS medics in the Kandahar region. In about half a day, Caplin had the HRIG delivered to Kraus who administered it to his patient. Weiss commented on the coordination efforts saying it was “truly an impressive example of civilian-military cooperation” that very likely saved the Afghan’s life. DynCorp International teams take great pride in going the extra mile to continually meet the company’s core values: We serve, We care, We empower, We perform, and We do the right thing, always.",Public
" Three DynCorp International team members working in the Weapons Removal and Abatement (WRA) program in Afghanistan were recognized with Certificates of Appreciation for their team’s efforts in disposing of more than 300 tons of potentially dangerous explosives at Camp Zafar in Afghanistan. James McGuire, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technical advisor, Mohammad Sediq, WRA Conventional Weapons Destruction (CWD) team leader, and Ramin Azimy, WRA CWD area manager, coordinated the team effort. The Explosives, ANFO (Ammonium Nitrate and Fuel Oil) and Ammonite were being stored at Camp Zafar, an Afghan military base, where they would partially melt during the heat of the summer and freeze during winter.  As the weather took its toll, the explosives began to deteriorate and become unstable. Because of the potential danger to those in the area posed by the unstable explosives, it was determined that they needed to be properly disposed. McGuire, Sediq and Azimy worked with U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A), International Security Assistance Force, the U.S. embassy, U.S. Military Task Force and Afghan National Army Forces to coordinate the explosives disposal. “The credit for this honor goes entirely to the team as a whole. The WRA team worked professionally and efficiently to make sure the explosives were properly disposed and everyone in the area was safe. It was truly a herculean effort on the team’s part and they did an outstanding job,” commented McGuire. DynCorp International (DI) supports the U.S. Department of State’s Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement worldwide in the destruction and safe handling and proper storage or securing of small arms and light weapons (SA/LW), stockpiled munitions, abandoned ordnance, man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), and other conventional weapons. DI also supports the U.S. Department of State’s PM/WRA Office with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) that deploys worldwide. The QRF is a team of fully trained and certified weapons removal and abatement technical specialists, with a support infrastructure capable of rapidly implementing conventional weapons destruction and mitigation.

" As a police advisor supporting the U.S. Civilian Police (CIVPOL) contract with the U.S. State Department’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in South Sudan, Michael Taylor is not only mentoring officers in the South Sudan Police Force, he is also making an impact in the local community. In working closely with South Sudan police officers, he was told about a young orphan girl, Jackoline, who lived in poor conditions in a local village. Jackoline was well-known in the community as the “running girl,” for her ability to run long distances. Touched by her story and wanting to help the local community, Taylor coordinated with various aid agencies in South Sudan to get Jackoline accepted into school and placed in a better living environment. “Michael is a dedicated police advisor always looking for ways to improve the living and working conditions of the South Sudanese people, so it comes as no surprise that he would be compelled to help Jackoline,” commented James Morrill, DynCorp International manager, CIVPOL – Haiti, Sudan & Palestine. Taylor supports the U.S. State Department’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) CIVPOL contract as part of the Sudan U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). In his current role, he mentors the South Sudanese police force on the importance of respecting human rights. DynCorp International supports UNMISS by providing a U.S. contingent of up to 15 law enforcement, judicial, and corrections advisors. The mission is focused on re-building South Sudan’s security infrastructure. Law enforcement specialists train, equip, and mentor the South Sudanese police force in democratic principles; judicial advisors help restore the justice system; and corrections advisors work with local counterparts to help modernize the prison system. DI’s training and mentoring capabilities focus primarily on security sector reform, but also include nation building support for the emerging ministries of interior and defense in underdeveloped nations recovering from conflict or political instability. DI works closely with customers, international donor nations and local government institutions to assess risks and apply the right mix of professional services and advanced technologies. DI’s Training and Mentoring business area provides experienced law enforcement professionals to missions around the world, helping nations create modern, professional police institutions and maintain the rule of law.",Public
"  At a Wharton Aerospace Conference, DynCorp International Chairman and CEO Steve Gaffney discussed the company’s strengths and plans for the future. DynCorp International has more than 25,000 personnel working in 35 countries and 150 locations. The company’s history is in aviation but today it offers a wide array of services including training and mentoring, international development, and intelligence training solutions. DI’s primary objective is to provide the U.S. and its allies with defense, diplomacy and international development solutions to reinforce national security and foreign policy objectives around the world. Gaffney feels that leadership attributes define an intentional culture of a company, and it will be the people, leadership, and culture that will be the discriminator for DI going forward. Creating a positive culture is a priority at DI; this creates loyal employees who work harder and develop loyal customers creating profitable growth. DynCorp International encourages a culture based on shared core values that include we serve, we care, we empower, we perform and we do the right thing. Strong leadership attributes build strong teams, inspire commitment and deliver results. This is why DI reviews and assesses its employees on the basis of results and behaviors and has defined specific leadership attributes to teach managers and supervisors how to bring out the best in their teams. In addition, the company has created a social contract for team managers and members which includes respecting the opinions of others and utilizing open, honest communication. As Gaffney stated, “team members who feel good about their teams will outperform competitor’s teams who don’t focus on these important attributes.” Gaffney believes that in a service company your people are your products. The “artifacts” left behind are not tangible items but rather the stories about the people who delivered the mission. He wants the DI stories to be that all employees were committed to the mission, leaned forward, and treated others with respect. As combat missions decline and diplomatic missions increase, Gaffney believes that the company has a good mix of services that cover combat, non-combat and reconstruction operations. And as Gaffney stated, it’s the best team that generally wins at the end of the day. To find out more about DynCorp International’s services, strengths, and culture, follow DI on Twitter.",Public
" The support that DynCorp International provides the Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Office of Aviation (INL/A, also known as the INL Air Wing program) was recently mentioned in Florida Today. DI team members working in Patrick Air Force Base in Cocoa Beach, Fla., in the INL Air Wing program are currently instructing Air Force pilots that are headed to Afghanistan to help train and build the Afghan air force. According to the article, Paul O’Sullivan Jr., deputy director of the Department of State Air Wing at Patrick Air Force Base commented, “We were really happy when the Air Force said, ‘Can we use your guys?’. We’re happy to be able to help them.” The article quoted Air Force Major Earl Burress, a pilot from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, who recently completed the two-week classroom portion of the training. “I think that the air adviser’s mission is a very important mission,” Burress said. “It will not only potentially save American lives but provide valuable training for the Afghans.” The DI team, comprised of four pilots, two loadmasters and two maintenance instructors, will be training the pilots and technicians in C-27 twin engine cargo planes in the six to eight week program. The goal of the program overall is to have enough Afghan pilots trained and flying transport missions in the C-27 aircraft by the time the United States withdraws from Afghanistan. The C-27 was selected by the Department of Defense in 2007 to fulfill Army and Air Force requirements for a medium-lift, intra-theater airlift aircraft. The primary mission of the C-27 is to deliver time sensitive/mission critical supplies the “last tactical mile” and the aircraft is perfectly suited to delivering cargo and supplies to forward tactical units in remote, austere locations and land or take off from short unimproved runways that are not accessible by other means. DI’s work at Patrick Air Force Base falls under its Air Operations business, which provides extensive specialty aviation support for efforts to reduce the flow of illicit drugs, strengthen law enforcement and support host nations. On a daily basis, FAA-screened and certified professionals execute critical missions across the globe. Supported by experienced pilots, mechanics and technicians – employing best-practices on the latest in equipment and technologies – each mission is carried out with maximum effectiveness and security.

" In addition to attending “The Community’s Got Talent” event, held February 2, 2012 at the State Theatre in Falls Church, Va., DynCorp International was a Silver Sponsor, donating to both The CIA Officers Memorial Foundation (CIAOMF) and The Special Operations Warrior Foundation (SOWF). In the inaugural event hosted by KippsDeSanto & Co., “The Community’s Got Talent” is an invitation-only “battle of the bands” that directly benefits CIAOMF and SOWF. CIAOMF and SOWF provide direct financial support for college education, technical training, personal counseling and professional education to surviving dependents of fallen shadow warriors. Combined, these foundations provide college funding for almost 800 surviving dependents of fallen shadow warriors. Hosted by actor/comedian/musician Dan Aykroyd, “The Community’s Got Talent” featured bands comprised exclusively of musically talented intelligence community, special operations forces and industry personnel. Competing bands were judged by a discerning panel of internationally-recognized music critics. Immediately following the battle of the bands segment, Dan “Elwood Blues” Aykroyd and Steely Dan founding member, Skunk Baxter, performed a Blues Brothers “Lite” set. The event was attended by senior leadership in the intelligence and special operations fields, as well as active duty military personnel and government officials. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Officers Memorial Foundation was established to provide financial and other assistance to the families of CIA officers who have died in the line of duty. In May 2006, the foundation’s Board of Directors voted to expand its mission by providing educational support to the spouses and children of CIA officers who die while on active duty from accident, illness or other causes. The foundation has also provided financial support to CIA officers and their families to deal with emergencies and specific circumstances resulting from carrying out the mission of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Special Operations Warrior Foundation was founded in 1980 to provide support and assistance to personnel serving in the U.S. Special Operations Command. There are two major aspects to the Foundation’s mission: For those who lose their life in an operational mission or training accident serving in the U.S. military special operations community, the Warrior Foundation provides funding for a full college education to surviving children. For those who are severely wounded while deployed, the Warrior Foundation provides immediate financial assistance and support to family members during recovery, which may be used for travel, child care, food and lodging.",Public
" DynCorp International (DI) announced that the Department of Defense Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) is awarding DI the prestigious Nunn-Perry Award for its outstanding Mentor-Protégé team formed with its small business partner, CenterScope Technologies Inc.

" Fulfilling DynCorp International’s focus on developing its leaders, DynCorp International team members working in DI’s Air Operations business recently met with the company’s chief learning officer, Steve Dwyer, and outside experts to participate in one-on-one leadership development training and group sessions. In their training, leaders completed personal profiles, which identify factors that individuals can focus on to become better leaders in the workplace and beyond. Team members also gained insight by receiving feedback from colleagues, and comparing and contrasting different personality types and the different ways to interact to provide maximum performance for the company’s customers. Through the leadership workshop, team members learned how to optimize work performance by creating customized growth plans to capitalize on strengths, enhancing self-awareness and raising emotional quotient – all while embracing DI’s core values. “All DI employees’ actions are guided by our social contract, which encompasses our core values – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform and We Do the Right Thing. At the end of the day, that social contract is the ultimate litmus test for how our team members lead,” said Dwyer.

" DynCorp International staff working on the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) in Afghanistan went the extra yard and helped U.S. troops at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Spin Boldak celebrate Super Bowl Sunday. DI’s food service staff provided a full Super Bowl XLVI party complete with a big screen television, refreshments, finger foods and desserts. “DynCorp International’s Dining Facilities (DFACs) staff wants to make sure that the warfighters get a taste of home by bringing special events – like the Super Bowl, holidays, and other occasions – to Afghanistan,” said Allen Penrose, Project Food Service Manager at DynCorp International. Spin Boldak’s DFAC Manager, Barbara Wilson, and her dedicated team worked together help the troops celebrate. “Event planning always starts at least two months beforehand with the planning of the meal and decorations that would accommodate the function.  Once the meal is ordered, the DFAC managers start brainstorming ways to make the occasion unique for the personnel on base.  For this event, the warfighters were treated to pizza, wings, meatballs and onion rings – everything you would find at a typical Super Bowl party in the U.S.,” explained Wilson. As part of the LOGCAP IV program in Afghanistan, nearly 1200 DI team members work on the food service team which operates 37 full-service dining facilities. “The DI personnel that serve on the Food Service team bring a lot of experience, skills and specialized talents. They collectively used their creativity and expertise to put together a meal that the warfighters truly enjoyed,” said Allen Penrose, Project Food Service Manager for LOGCAP IV. DynCorp International serves as one of the three contractors that supports the U.S. and Coalition troops overseas under the LOGCAP IV contract.

" Metallurgy is study of the the physical and chemical behavior of metallic elements, or alloys. In aviation maintenance, metallurgy is used to identify imperfections before equipment leaves the warehouse or production floor. Metallurgy is often used in manufacturing and engineering to provide failure analysis. Mike Schofield, aircraft mechanic for DynCorp International, uses metallurgy and Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) procedures to test equipment for DynCorp International programs. “I deal with all types of aircraft support equipment and aircraft parts – from prop tools for the E-2 Hawkeyes to aircraft spotting dolleys,” said Schofield. From inspections that build and repair units for aviation and air operations, to the mechanics needed during operations and maintenance, Schofield’s technical know-how is a seamless test and inspection practice from start to finish. It’s a 360-degree approach. “Some of the tools I use on the metal involve ultrasonics, or sound waves, eddy-current, or alternating current, magnetism and fluorescent penetrants,” said Schofield. Metallurgy can detect defects that cannot be found through visual inspection – even the smallest cracks – ensuring the aircraft parts used in military aircraft are of top quality. For example, when using ultrasonics prior to disassembling a part, if sound waves produce an image inside a metal piece, further analysis can be done to pinpoint the defect inside of the part. Detecting these faults is an important part of keeping aircraft equipment safe. “We inspect the equipment at 100 percent. We take care of them before they get out to their locations. We have to send out quality parts to the troops,” said Schofield. This work is part of the support DynCorp International’s Aviation business provides its customers, important support that allows military aircraft to safely perform their missions. Aviation experts from DynCorp International are there to support various customers’ aviation needs around the world, from upgrades for aircraft, engineering design, building and installing kits, to upgrading avionics and more.

" Dozens of DynCorp International team members in Fort Worth, Texas, joined together to help the north Texas area by holding a winter blood drive on January 27, 2012. One pint of blood can save up to three lives, so donations from the drive will benefit more than 120 people! DI sponsored the event with Hillwood and Tarrant County Community Colleges in accordance with National Blood Donor Month. All donations directly benefit North Texas residents, collected through Carter BloodCare. “We are proud to work with Carter BloodCare and have the chance to directly benefit the community here in Texas. It’s always refreshing to see how many people come out to the drives we hold each year and participate,” said Amy Jones, administrative specialist and Employee Assistance Program (EAP) ambassador at DynCorp International. Carter BloodCare was founded in 1998 by the merger of two local blood centers, making Carter BloodCare Texas’ largest blood center. In April 2007, Carter BloodCare also merged with Tyler, Texas-based Stewart Regional Blood Center. Together, they provide more than 330,000 units of lifesaving blood to North Central and East Texas each year. Carter BloodCare is a not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) organization that operates on behalf of patients and their loved ones in 54 Texas counties. Since 1970, January has been known as National Blood Donor Month. January is a challenging time for blood donation because winter weather and busy post-holiday schedules can make it difficult for blood donors to keep appointments. Regardless of the time of year, hospital patients nationwide need about 44,000 blood donations daily for cancer care, surgeries, and the treatment of serious diseases and trauma. Just one pint of blood can help save up to three lives. Blood donation organizations encourage donors to make and keep appointments during National Blood Donor month and hold events such as winter blood drives to support donation efforts. Last August, DynCorp International participated in a similar event in Falls Church, Va., the “Give the Gift of Life” blood drive, operated by Inova Blood Donor Services. A blood mobile was on site as DI employees contributed to the largest hospital-based blood-collection operation in the country. The DynCorp International values that are applied daily to job performance – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform, We Do the Right Thing – are also values that are carried into the communities where DI lives and works. Employing tens of thousands of people around the world provides DI with unique opportunities to give back through philanthropic donations, local training programs and hands-on volunteer work.

This same process is used to build in quality through elimination of variation in work processes. Lean Six Sigma is a tool that enables DI to uphold its reputation for excellence as a global government service provider. “We utilize the Lean Six Sigma process to help us increase efficiency,” said Tony Garcia, Site Manager for U.S. Navy Support at DynCorp International. The processes helps DI reduce the amount of hours it takes to complete a unit and to reduce turnaround times,” Garcia explains. “This gives us the ability to get the product back to the customer better, faster and cheaper.” From services that build and repair units for aviation and air operations, to the technical mechanics needed during operations and maintenance, the Lean Six Sigma process helps to create a seamless manufacturing practice from start to finish. “Our Lean Six Sigma process is a bottom-up approach,” said Garcia. What makes the tactic uniquely systemic is that DynCorp International relies on the technical know-how of its own employees. “We use technicians and mechanics off the floor,” said Garcia. “They devise a problem statement. They analyze the problem. Then they devise the answer. It’s the employees who perform the work who actually come up with the solutions – that is what allows us to sustain the solutions.” DynCorp International is committed to continuous process improvement. The Lean Six Sigma process allows the company to provide expertly conceived and professionally executed services to meet the complex demands of today’s world. “We’ve been able to cut the amount of hours it takes to complete a unit by up to – in some cases – 60 to 70 percent,” said Garcia. Lean Six Sigma helps DynCorp International integrate its many competencies to provide customer service solutions that fit each client and situation. Garcia explains. “The process helps bring a culture of compliance, accountability and relentless performance to each project and task. Best of all, it increases productivity.” “All this means that we’re able to get the product back to the customer in a more timely fashion, which pleases the customer,” said Garcia.

Stephanie Gaffney, Employee Assistance Program Manager at DynCorp International, met with the team in Haiti and encouraged them to take advantage of the Employee Assistance Program and its benefits. The DI Care Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is designed to support DI personnel in the United States and around the world – and their families. The team provides special assistance in a range of circumstances – from an employee injury to the tragic event of a fatality. EAP staff travel around the world anywhere they are needed to support DI personnel and their families, and educate them about the support that is available through DI. Gaffney commented on her trip to Haiti, “Every time we have the opportunity to visit one of DI’s programs, it underscores the importance of the DI Care EAP. Our people are making a difference in communities around the world – I saw firsthand the positive changes in that are occurring in Haiti.

" Spencer Himes was starting his last two years of service with the U.S. Military when he discovered a hidden calling to train as a handler for the military’s canine unit working with Explosive Detector Dogs (EDDs). While working as a military police officer on a Special Reaction Team for the Provost Marshal’s Office, Himes came in contact with the installation canine unit. After befriending some of the dog handlers and researching the role, he was determined to become a dog handler and headed to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas for 11 weeks of handler training. Working with a Patrol EDD, Himes first learned how to command the dog for tactics such as patrol techniques, controlled aggression, scouting, pursuing a fleeing suspect and obedience. He then focused on working with the dog to find narcotics or explosives. Himes was also taught how to properly care for the dog’s health. Himes commented, “The dogs are already up-to-speed and are actually training the handlers – showing them how to avoid the dangers from explosive devices by learning the dog’s reactions. For example, the dog will sit or have some other non-aggressive reaction when they have discovered a potentially dangerous object.” After serving in the military, Himes went to work for DynCorp International in Iraq as an Explosive Detective Dog Handler. That’s where he met Rex, the half German Shepherd, half Belgian Malinois who became his partner for the next three and a half years. They trained together for some time so Himes could build rapport with Rex and they eventually became mission-certified for work at one of the regional embassies. Their primary duty was to sweep areas where meetings would take place to ensure the safety of the participants. EDDs generally train for about 60 days on detecting explosives in open areas, buildings, vehicles and on travel routes before they are initially certified. Detection training can utilize traditional protocol training, or what is known as the deferred final response training method. Canines are also trained in patrol techniques which teach basic obedience and proficiency in completing obstacle courses, scouting for suspects, building search methods and controlled aggression. Patrol training also takes approximately 60 days. There is no specific breed requirement for EDD team dogs, although you most often see German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois, Dutch Shepherds or Labradors. Other breeds such as Weimaraners, German Shorthaired Pointers Vizslas or even Beagles are also used as EDDs. “It’s really more the temperament of the dog that matters. This also determines the type of work the dog will perform as each dog is evaluated to see where it fits best. Rex is a bit skittish and will defend more than he will attack, so he was a great choice as an explosives dog,” said Himes. Now seven years old and suffering from arthritis, Rex is retired from his EDD work and lives with Himes in Johns Island, S.C. Handlers are often allowed to keep their retired dogs through a formal written request to the State Department. A veterinarian must examine the dog to confirm that it should be retired, the State Department must agree, and the handler must have the proper living environment for the dog. According to Himes, Rex is enjoying his well-earned retirement and happily handling his new role of companion and friend—with no danger attached.",Public

" In DynCorp International’s Aviation business area, DI team members perform depot-level maintenance on aircraft support equipment. From equipment that moves aircraft, equipment that starts aircraft, equipment to recover an aircraft to equipment to test aircraft, DI runs the gamut on aviation maintenance for military aircraft. Tony Garcia, Site Manager, U.S. Navy Support Equipment for DynCorp International, describes the maintenance process for support equipment used on aircraft carriers. “When a carrier comes in to port, we strip the gear down completely, we remove the engine (if it has an engine), we take out the transmission, we remove the tires – every component in that piece of equipment. It’s all either cleaned, repaired or replaced. The gear goes through complete sandblast, paint, and once we’re done, it’s like new equipment.” “What makes DynCorp International unique is our people,” said Garcia. “We hire former military, we hire former Marines, we hire former Navy personnel – so they’re already familiar and trained on this gear. We tap into that training and tap into their knowledge and we bring them on board and we execute the mission.” The work performed in DynCorp International’s Aviation business area allows military aircraft to perform their missions.

" Jennifer West, Financial Systems Analyst at DynCorp International, discussed implementation of the Hyperion Financial Management (HFM) program at the Hyperion Professional Women’s Forum held November 15 at the La Cima Club in Irving, Texas. HFM is a comprehensive, Web-based application that delivers global financial consolidation, reporting and analysis in a single, highly scalable software solution. HFM utilizes advanced technology, yet is built to be owned and maintained by an enterprise’s finance team. West cited benefits of using HFM at DynCorp International, such as: DI currently has 150 HFM users and was implemented in August 2010. Since implementation, financial reporting processes have improved organization and administration capabilities, allowing for the opportunity to better plan and forecast DI’s finances. “Quarterly training continues to be offered to all HFM users.  The new system, Smartview, provides a versatile way to create specialized reports and puts the power in the users’ hands.  We continue to work with the business to make improvements and put more information into the system to make reporting easier for DynCorp International’s business,” said West. The Hyperion Professional Women’s Forum was founded to create a community dedicated to the flow of ideas, expertise and inspiration among forward-thinking women in Enterprise Performance Management. The Forum hosts quarterly events attended by women of all backgrounds who work with Oracle/Hyperion software. At each event, Hyperion professionals discuss their experience with HFM through presentations and administrators are given the opportunity to network and share best practices. Not only is the forum committed to fostering an energized community of women in the industry, but also supports local charities through fundraisers held at each event. The Dallas Challenge, Rose Ribbon Foundation and the Genesis Women’s Shelter have all benefited through the Forum’s quarterly events.

After several surgeries and months of physical therapy, Carr now walks without assistance. “I can run, jump, and move almost as well as I used to. I’m currently doing my physical therapy and I look forward to returning to work soon. I will continue serving my country in any way that I can,” said Carr. Before joining DI in August 2010, Carr served in the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army. Carr was awarded the Purple Heart Medal for combat injuries from an I.E.D. while deployed in Iraq and also received the Combat Infantry Badge.

Since 1976, Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services has shown a commitment to bettering the lives of those in the community. DynCorp International works with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as CAL FIRE, to help suppress and control wild land fires. “One of our premiere programs is our CAL FIRE program. We provide full fleet management for the California Department of Forestry. We manage the aircraft, we fly them, we help them to put out fires all through California, all during the fire season,” said Catherine Gridley, vice president of Aviation for DynCorp International. DI has worked with the CAL FIRE program since 2001 and will continue the program through 2014. “It’s a great program.

" “From the moment I received notification of my husband’s injuries in Afghanistan while he was employed with DynCorp, I was given the best possible treatment and information from DynCorp’s EAP staff,” said Julieann Robertson. The DI Care Employee Assistance Program (EAP), is a program designed to support DI employees and their families – providing special assistance in a range of circumstances, from an employee injury or in the tragic event of a fatality. This program supports the DI core value “We Care.”  The initiative highlights how DI values the safety, security, development and well-being of all of its personnel. Robertson’s husband, Thomas Robertson, a Field Mentor who had been working in Afghanistan, was injured outside Kandahar. “I was told that the EAP support staff was there for me day or night at any hour and they meant it,” said Robertson. “No matter when I called, the staff showed the utmost care, diligence, and respect for my concerns. I was given daily updates on my husband’s medical status and transportation plans, which helped alleviate much of the stress on me.” DynCorp International’s DI Care EAP is an employee-focused solutions program for employees and families providing problem solving for complex issues related to the myriad challenges employees can face related to medical benefits, post injury recovery and reintegration back into the workforce. DI Care EAP also acts as an advocate for surviving family members of employees who have been killed in action, explaining different benefits, assisting with funeral arrangements and assisting with commemoration efforts. Soon after Thomas was injured, Michael Warren, vice president of Human Resources – Employee Assistance Programs and Stephanie Gaffney, manager, Employee Assistance Programs, contacted Julieann to assist. “No matter what the question was, both Mike and Stephanie were willing to help find the answer and worked diligently to make sure everything was taken care of and in order,” Robertson said. “Having all of the transportation, hospitalization, doctors, and nurse manager care lined up before my husband arrived back in the United States was a major help and allowed me to focus on our family instead of the red tape and paperwork.” When Nelson Stacy Croft, also a Field Mentor who was working in Afghanistan, was injured, Donald Tate, Civilian Police Advisor (CIVPOL) program EAP Officer, was there to support Croft’s family. Tate stayed in constant communication with Karen Croft, Nelson’s wife, keeping her updated on her husband’s condition. With the help of the DI Care EAP, Croft underwent complete rehabilitation and was even able to redeploy to Afghanistan. The best part, said Karen Croft, “he’s working without disabilities. “One cannot imagine going through an ordeal like this without someone to keep one grounded. I would like to thank DynCorp International for having such a great program in place to be sure their wounded are taken care of properly.”",Public

Operating from across California, aircraft can reach most fires within 20 minutes. The OV-10A aircraft fly over fires, directing the air tankers and helicopters to critical areas for retardant and water drops. The retardant used to slow or retard the spread of a fire is a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum-thickening agent, and a coloring agent. While both airtankers and helicopters are equipped to carry fire retardant or water, the helicopters can also transport firefighters, equipment and injured personnel. All CAL FIRE Aircraft are strategically located throughout the state at airbases and helicopter bases. During high fire activity, CAL FIRE may move aircraft to better provide statewide air support.

" After heavy rains from Tropical Depression 12-E and Hurricane Jova left parts of Guatemala flooded, DynCorp International team members working at the direction of the Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Office of Aviation (INL/A, also known as the INL Air Wing program) were able to support humanitarian assistance efforts for those in isolated areas. The Government of Guatemala’s Aviation Support Program (ASP), which is supported under DI’s Air Operations business, provided disaster relief flights in the northern province of Petén and southern provinces of Retalhuleu and Escuintla. In total, DI team members supported 18 sorties that transported 50 passengers and 20,365 pounds of relief supplies. In mid-October, Tropical Depression 12-E and Hurricane Jova hit parts of Mexico and Central America, causing heavy rainfall, floods and mudslides. The most affected areas were: Chimaltenango, El Progreso, Escuintla, Guatemala, Jalapa, Jutiapa, Petén, Quetzaltenango, Retalhuleu, San Marcos, Santa Rosa, Sololá, Suchitepéquez and Totonicapán. With more than 470,000 residents affected, the Guatemalan government decreed a State of Public Calamity. In more populated areas, roads and highways were damaged, electricity service was disrupted and thousands of homes were damaged. However, those in the isolated areas of Petén, Retalhuleu and Escuintla needed help the most. Working at the direction of INL/A, the DynCorp International team provided assistance in coordination with the ASP and Guatemala’s disaster relief agency Coordinadora Nacional para la Reducción de Desastres (CONRED). CONRED was established to prevent disasters or reduce their impact on the citizens of Guatemala and coordinate disaster relief efforts. The Executive Secretariat of CONRED, also known as SE-CONRED, is responsible for day to day management of the organization. CONRED aims to communicate with Guatemalans on potential hazards, impending or actual disasters based on information provided by the National Institute for Seismology, Vulcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology (INSIVUMEH), and for declaring states of alert. Once a disaster has been declared, it is responsible for the coordination of cross-sectoral disaster relief efforts. CONRED is part of a Central American network of governmental disaster relief agencies known as the Coordination Center for the Prevention of Natural Disasters in Central America (CEPREDENAC).

" DynCorp International LLC, staff in Kandahar, Afghanistan, celebrated Halloween by donating their time and treats to U.S. military personnel. At Kandahar Air Field (KAF), employees spent an evening after their shifts assembling goody bags of assorted candy, letters and small toys sent from stateside family and friends, and handing them out to the men and women who serve our country. The bags – along with a smile – were distributed to U.S. military personnel at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Baylough.  Sherry Prine, Logistics Civil Augmentation Program IV (LOGCAP IV) Contracts Compliance Manager, organized the effort and is also responsible for organizing several events on the base throughout the year. Much of the goody bags’ contents were sent to Kandahar from students and faculty at J.E. Turner Elementary in Wilmer, Ala. and Jim Thorpe Elementary in Henderson, Nev., who donated assorted candy, handwritten letters and cards. Families and friends of DynCorp International staff who ship care packages during the holidays to pass out to the troops also contributed to the goody bags’ contents. “Thanks to the generosity of  those at J.E. Turner Elementary and Jim Thorpe Elementary as well as DI team members from all over the world, we were  able to provide enough candies, cards, and a hand written letters to each of the warfighters stationed at FOB Baylough,” said Prine. The Halloween event was organized to help brighten the holiday for U.S. service men and women. As with any good idea, it started with one person who wanted to do something good and evolved into something bigger. Others joined the plan, asking stateside contacts to send baked goods. Boxes and bags were collected until a few days before Halloween and photos were taken throughout the day. Prine and a team of volunteers from the LOGCAP IV program visited the Role 3 Multinational Medical Unit, KAF’s military hospital, badging offices, Army Post Office, and boardwalk areas to distribute goody bags until everything was handed out. With each contact with a troop member, DynCorp International staff would say, “Thank you for your service.” Said Prine, “The gifts were given away fast, but the memories the volunteers collected during that brief time will last.” Beyond the DI Core Values of: We Care, We Serve, We Empower, We Perform and We Do the Right Thing, DynCorp International team members aim to support those serving in the Armed Forces in any way possible.

" DynCorp International sponsored the first Leadership Development training course in to those working in the Afghanistan National Police/Ministry of Interior Development Program (AMDP) and Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (CSTC-A) in Kabul, Afghanistan. DI team members attended the three-day, hands-on, learning experience focused on building skills in leadership competence areas. The Leadership 201 course was conducted by Steve Dwyer, Chief Learning Officer at DynCorp International and Lee Bason, Executive VP, The Flippen Group. The training focused on the principle that people work better for leaders who are not only competent, but who care about their employees and are committed to their success. Attendees received evaluations that showed them how their behaviors are perceived by coworkers, how they compare to the rest of the population, and how they compare to high-performers. The training also revolved around the theory of Overcoming Personal Constraints (OPC), which teaches people how to break the constraints that limit performance and hinder growth. “We believe that it’s not our strengths that ultimately determine our success, but our ability to become self-aware with regards to our constraints and how those constraints impact ourselves and our teammates. All of us have personal constraints but those who manage them best, will have the greatest opportunities to win for themselves, their families, and for DynCorp International,” Bason said. After the training session, participants developed TrAction Plans designed to help manage their constraints and become more effective teammates during one-on-one coaching sessions. “I was blown away by the feedback from the DI team. During our one-on-one sessions, it was clear that improving their leadership skills is a priority,” said Bason. One of DynCorp International’s core values is “We Empower,” and leveraging training and development opportunities is just one way DI embraces that value. To provide effective talent management and support to employees, DI supports a company culture that empowers employees by enhancing knowledge, skills, and experiences and maximizes performance. Along with training from The Flippen Group, DI offers an interactive Leadership 101 course to all employees which encourages continuing development as a leader within DynCorp International.

" DynCorp International team members located at the Falls Church, Va. headquarters and Alexandria, Va. offices will be participating in this year’s Food for Others Thanksgiving Food Drive. Food for Others collects items necessary for a complete Thanksgiving meal and puts together baskets that will provide a full holiday meal for families in the Northern Virginia area. DynCorp International team members will be donating canned potatoes, canned fruit, gravy, stuffing mix and other non-perishable items to complete the Thanksgiving meal baskets. Last year, DI donated more than 215 lbs. of food and $220 in gift cards for turkeys to Food for Others. Established in 1995, Food for Others serves families in the Northern Virginia area that may need food donations when an emergency strikes, and for the growing number of working poor who are unable to make ends meet and need to supplement their inadequate food supplies. Food for Others obtains much of its food through food rescue operations and food drives. Through food rescue operations, staff and volunteers pick up non-expired food items that would be otherwise thrown away from local grocery stores and other retail food establishments. The food is brought to the warehouse for temporary storage, including refrigeration as appropriate. Food drives contribute to most of the non-perishable food supply. Food for Others’ mission is to obtain and distribute free food to those in need in the Northern Virginia area and to support food programs of other community-based organizations. Food for Others also provides a channel for people to volunteer their services and help their neighbors in need. Local merchants, the USDA, food drives, and crop harvests provide the food; volunteers and staff provide the hands; and charitable contributions and fundraising events provide the funds. Charitable contributions provide a major part of Food for Others’ budget. About 96 cents out of every revenue dollar is used for program expenses. The DynCorp International values that we apply to our job performance – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform, We Do the Right Thing – are also values that we carry into the communities where we live and work, especially around the holidays.

This year’s participating team also sold t-shirts representing the American Cancer Society-Florida’s theme, “Put on Your Pink Bra,” and a portion of t-shirt sales were also donated to ACS.  DI team members walked for friends, family members and survivors who have battled breast cancer. The actions demonstrated by DI team members at PSD, which fall under DynCorp International’s Air Operations business area team, work to embrace DI’s core values, “We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform and We Do the Right Thing.” Since 1993, nearly five million walkers across the country have raised more than $340 million through Making Strides events to help funding groundbreaking discoveries into cancer’s causes and cures. American Cancer Society donations to this cause have helped fund major breast cancer research breakthroughs, including: In 2011, the American Cancer Society launched the “Put On Your Pink Bra” campaign, empowering women across Florida to wear pink bras in support of the fight against breast cancer and as a personal symbol of their breast cancer journey. During Making Strides Against Breast Cancer events, a sea of participants in pink bras will join together to take up arms against the disease. Participants form teams of friends, family, neighbors and co-workers and work together to set goals and fundraise before each event. The day of Making Strides Against Breast Cancer, teams unite together at the starting line and complete the non-competitive walk, showing their support for the American Cancer Society’s mission of saving lives and creating more birthdays.",Public
" DynCorp International team members working on the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP IV) contract at the Camp Leatherneck Fire Department in Afghanistan completed Fire Extinguisher Training earlier this month. New members of the Headquarters and Service Company 1st Battalion, 25 Marines also participated as part of a Weapons Certification Course. Randy Robinson, LOGCAP Firefighter at Camp Leatherneck Fire Department, explained how to protect the base while standing guard at posts and described the various types of fire extinguishers. Portable Fire Extinguishers can save lives and property by putting out or containing fires within the capability of the extinguisher. However, they must be of the correct type for the particular fire, and they must be used correctly. Each type of extinguisher may be rated for one or more classes of fire. In some cases, particular extinguishers are not only considered ineffective against certain classes of fire, they can be dangerous if used in those circumstances. The classes of fire are: Class A (Ordinary Combustibles), Class B (Flammable and combustible liquids), Class C (Flammable gases), Class D (Combustible metals), Class E (Electrically energized equipment), and Class F (Cooking oils and fats). For example, a fake extinguisher that fueled the fire instead of putting it out was given to the class in order to demonstrate the need to accurately verify the extinguisher type before being used. LOGCAP Firefighters Marc Fowler and Afrim Latifi then instructed the class on the proper use of a certified Fire Extinguisher.  The class learned the PASS system: Captain Thomas Cunningham, Commander, 1st Battalion, 25th Marines commented, “We want to thank the DynCorp International team for their professionalism and willingness to help.” On October 15, Don Schell, LOGCAP Firefighter and Fire Inspector, conducted the Fire Warden and Fire Extinguisher certification training at Forward Operating Base Edinburgh, Afghanistan.  Both classes require a combination of classroom and hands-on training. Seventeen DynCorp International team members and 11 military personnel, including the Camp Commandant, attended the Fire Warden training, while 13 DI employees and nine military personnel attended the Fire Extinguisher training. Regular training sessions, such as these, help to keep FOB Edinburgh’s fire safety program successful. “Edinburgh’s Fire Protection program is one of the best in theater,” commented Schell.",Public
" Every day new members of the DynCorp International (DI) team arrive at the Kandahar Air Base (KAF) in Afghanistan. Passengers are first lined up on the edge of the flight line for the Personnel Tracking System (PTS) scan.  The PTS is used to track and locate employees. Passengers are then sorted into several groups, usually by those returning from Rest and Recuperation (R&R) and newly hired employees. At this point new hires meet the personnel escorts from the Receiving Staging and Onward Integration (RSOI) team.  Personnel and baggage are then transported to the transient housing facilities located within the Receiving Staging and Onward Integration (RSOI). Jim DeLony, LOGCAP IV Project Manager, then addresses all new team members at the New Hire Welcome briefing. DeLony’s comments usually focus on the purpose for the LOGCAP program – to take care of the deployed soldiers in every way they can. “Respectively Serving Others with Integrity” is the RSOI motto.  The RSOI team’s mission is to take care of new employees until they are either turned over to their Functional Area Managers (FAM) located on KAF or transported to the DynAir terminal, DynCorp International’s  intra-theater airline. Heather Bard, Sr. Logistics Coordinator, shared her recent experience with RSOI. “I arrived in KAF during the last week of August 2011.  Soon after arrival, I attended the New Hire Welcome briefing that covered various health and safety measures relating to our stay in the RSOI.  Towards the end of the briefing, our Project Manager, Jim DeLony, said a few inspirational words to welcome us to DI,” said Bard. “Afterwards the RSOI escorts shared their experiences and gave us tips on what to expect while living and working in Afghanistan. Overall, the receiving process was smooth and straightforward and the RSOI team worked hard to make it a positive experience.” Christine Garrison, LOGCAP IV Escort Laborer, works at the RSOI assisting with New Hires. Christine is responsible for meeting New Hires at the flight line, assisting in the badging process, new hire orientations and escorting personnel to the Post Exchange (PX) and barber shop. However, Garrison is just one of many team members that goes above the traditional duties and embraces DI’s core values by assisting with other actions involving escorts, coordination activities, bus driver R&R’s, financial reports, turnover ratio reports, justifications and even making event flyers. There is a common phrase many people use when describing the RSOI, “It’s getting better and better.”  DI team members working together to accomplish their mission – that is the key to continuing success in the RSOI.",Public
" DynCorp International is featured in an article on the United States Army’s Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) in the October issue of Military Logistics Forum Magazine. The article cites DynCorp International as one of the three contractors that is currently providing support to the US and Coalition troops overseas under the LOGCAP IV contract. Among task orders awarded to DI on LOGCAP IV, the company supports the U.S. Army in Southern Afghanistan. According to the article, under this task order, DI “is providing existing bases with operations and maintenance support, including facilities management, electrical power, water, sewage and waste management, laundry operations, food services, and transportation motor pool operations,” as well as construction services for other sites. A.W. Short, DynCorp International LOGCAP Program Manager, commented, ““We have built over 40 camps,” said Short. “We do the maintenance on non-tactical vehicles, we run the motor pool and shuttle bus services. We operate the supply support activity, control cargo movements in the form of airlifts and truck movements. We are responsible for a very large number of containers. We are also responsible for inventory forecasting, project planning, and cost management and control.” The article also discusses how DI sources locally to reduce costs to the customer. “We use host nation trucking as a cost-saving method,” said Short. “Just in the last six months we had 3,200 truck movements. Of those, 2,300 used host-nation trucking. This saved a substantial amount of money.” DI’s LOGCAP team also aims to reduce demurrage costs by getting the 2,500 to 3,250 containers they move monthly back to their owners in a timely manner. DynCorp International is also responsible for providing health, safety and environmental staff support; morale, food and laundry services; sewage; power generation; firefighting; water provision and internet services. “We processed over a million requests for different things in the last six months,” said Short. “We ship equipment and supplies to over 1,200 unit addresses in southern Afghanistan. There is a lot of volume and lots of velocity in this operation. It comes at you very fast.” MLF is publication geared towards the military logistics community. MLF details every aspect of the supply chain from contracting and acquisition, development, life cycle management, reset and recap, asset management, and process improvement from factory to fort and beyond.",Public
" Representatives from DynCorp International (DI), the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and Hargrave Military Academy gathered on October 15, 2011 at the Hargrave Military Academy’s Parent’s Day Parade, in Chatham, Va., to honor Darrell L. Wetherbee, who was killed while serving as a police advisor for DynCorp International in Iraq in 2006. Cadet Dakota Wetherbee, Darrell L. Wetherbee’s son, accepted the DI Chairman’s Valor award on his behalf. Cadet Wetherbee was joined by his mother, Sheila Wetherbee, sister Stephanie Mahone, brother Clay Mahone, grandmother Brenda Mahon and grandfather Eddie Mahon at the ceremony. Darrell L. Wetherbee, 46, was killed on September 17, 2006 while on duty as a police advisor. Wetherbee, a former police officer from New Gloucester, Maine had been deployed in Iraq working for DynCorp International under the U.S. Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement’s (INL) civilian police contract (CivPol). He had participated in two previous civilian police missions, serving with the International Police Mission in Kosovo from 1999 – 2000 and 2001 – 2003. Before his deployment to Iraq, Wetherbee was also employed by the Freeport, Maine, Police Department and the State of Maine Judicial Branch. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1978 to 1986. David Dobrotka, DI VP CIVPOL Iraq Program Manager, presented the family with DI’s President’s Valor Award.  In presenting the award, Dobrotka cited an excerpt from the poem, “For the Fallen,” by Laurence Binyon: They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:  Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.  At the going down of the sun and in the morning,  We will remember them. Dobrotka also stated that the U.S. Government brings law enforcement officers like Wetherbee to the battle field and post-conflict regions because they represent all that is good and righteous about democratic policing in the U.S. The State Department’s Walter Redman, Chief Police Advisor, INL- Office of Criminal Justice Assistance and Partnerships, noted that, “While we pay tribute to the memory of our fallen friend and colleague – Darrell Wetherbee, who lost his life in service to his country – we also honor the service of all US law enforcement officers who are currently in missions around the world and those who have served in the past. INL addresses the issue of  transnational crime by assisting to strengthen governments and their criminal justice systems around the world to help keep us all safer at home.” Stephanie Gaffney, DI Manager of Employee Assistance Programs presented red roses to Sheila Wetherbee and Brenda Mahon, saying “the red roses represent respect and courage, we honor his memory and we know he is with us in spirit.” BG Don Broome, USA (Ret.), Hargrave president, stated, “The Parent’s Weekend parades feature an opportunity for families, especially the mothers, to pin academic stars on their son’s military blouse. To have the DI valor award posthumously presented to Cadet Wetherbee was fitting as it represents the highest calling of service. At Hargrave Military Academy, education is not limited to the classroom, but extends deeply into the areas of character development, leadership and spiritual growth.” DynCorp International’s Chairman’s Valor Award is the highest honor DI can bestow upon an employee.  It is presented to those who have exemplified bravery and heroism in the execution of their responsibilities in austere environments and in performing dangerous work.  This medal reflects the core values of our company: we serve, we care, we empower, we perform, and we do the right thing.",Public

" October is Breast Cancer Awareness month and one way DynCorp International is showing that “DI Cares” is through a “Blue Jeans for Breast Cancer” week, Oct. 17-21. DI team members who wish to participate may donate $5 for each day or $20 to wear jeans for the entire week.  The money raised by DynCorp International offices in Ft. Worth, Texas and Falls Church, Va. will directly benefit the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation. Donations will help fund breast cancer research, education, screening and treatment programs. Earlier this year, DynCorp International employees participated in another breast cancer-related fundraiser, the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Similar events are taking place throughout October in offices all over the United States. Sparked by the success of Lee National Denim Day, linking jeans with breast cancer awareness has been an easy way to support this great cause. Lee National Denim Day first took place in 1996, when several Lee Jeans employees realized that each of them, in one form or another, had been touched by breast cancer. An idea was sparked and led to the creation of Lee National Denim Day, which has become one of the largest single-day fundraisers nationwide for breast cancer. In its first year, Lee Jeans set a goal of raising $1 million on Lee National Denim Day. To do this, Lee Jeans invited companies to go casual for a cause, inviting employees to wear their jeans to work on Denim Day in exchange for a $5 contribution to the fight against breast cancer. Lee National Denim Day has raised more than $83 million for the fight against breast cancer. The Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation was founded in 1982 by Nancy G. Brinker, Susan G. Komen’s sister. Brinker was inspired by her sister, who throughout her battle with breast cancer, spent her time thinking of ways to make life better for other women in similar situations. Since Komen’s passing, Brinker has developed the Susan G. Komen for the Cure® foundation into a global leader for the breast cancer movement, investing more than $1.9 billion to breast cancer research. Today, the Komen foundation is the world’s largest grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and activists, working together to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for all and energize science to find the cures. Events like the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure® and the Susan G. Komen 3-Day for the Cure®, and generous contributions from partners, sponsors and supporters have contributed to the foundation’s success. A global government services provider that supports U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives, DynCorp International participates in many community and global efforts to support nonprofit organizations that seek to improve health and offer assistance to U.S. military, veterans, and their families.",Public

" Through a five year commitment, DynCorp International has donated $500,000 in support of the National Museum of the United States Army to the Army Historical Foundation. As a proud supporter of the U.S. Military, DI continues its support of the United States Army through this foundation. The Army Historical Foundation was established in 1983 as a member-based, publicly supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the history and heritage of the American Soldier. The foundation’s motto is “Preserve the heritage…educate the future,” and also describes its mission. The Foundation seeks to educate Americans to fully appreciate the sacrifices that generations of American soldiers have made to safeguard the freedoms of the United States. The foundation operates on donations and funds from memberships and grants. Supporting the National Museum of the United States Army is the foundation’s main initiative. In 2000, the Secretary of the Army designated the Foundation as its primary partner in the building of the National Museum. Foundation funding also helps to refurbish historical Army buildings, acquire and conserve Army historical art and artifacts, support Army history educational programs, research, and publication of historical materials on the American soldier, and provide support and counsel to private and governmental organizations committed to the same goals as the Foundation. The purpose of building the National Museum of the U.S. Army is to provide a place to the story of the U.S. Army comprehensively and pay tribute to the personal and professional sacrifices of its soldiers. The Army’s historical artifacts, artwork, and documents will be showcased properly for the benefit of the American public. The Museum will preserve, study, and exhibit Army history, including an estimated 750,000 artifacts and works of art. A series of chronological galleries and thematic galleries will convey the everyday lives of soldiers during times of peace and war. “Service and Sacrifice” will be the dominant theme throughout the Museum. Galleries will show the Army’s strength as an agent of peace and nation-building. Soldiers have conducted countless missions in the areas of exploration and discovery, science and technology, communications and cooperation, and recovery and disaster relief. The main building will be approximately 175,000 square feet. Outside this facility will be a park with a memorial garden and parade ground. Space is being planned to accommodate ceremonies, reenactments, lectures and educational programs. Additionally, space in the Museum will be available to veterans for conferences and reunions. The museum is set to open in 2015 in Fort Belvoir, Va.",Public

" DynCorp International sponsors Veterans Moving Forward (VMF), a non-profit foundation providing trained service dogs to veterans with physical and mental health challenges. VFW trains comfort, therapy or assistance dogs to meet veterans’ needs, and DI is proud to sponsor “Josh,” the foundation’s first assistance dog in training. Josh, now just over one year old, is named after Lance Corporal Joshua Michael Davis, U.S. Marine Corps, who was killed in Afghanistan in May of 2010. VMF names all of its assistance dogs in training (ADITs) after a fallen sailor, soldier, airmen, Marines or Coast Guardsmen. Josh is an AKC Labrador Retriever, bred by a Vietnam era veteran.  Michael C. Turner, Josh’s handler, is also a Vietnam era veteran.

Veterans Moving Forward was founded by Karen Jeffries and Bob Larson. Jeffries, a service-disabled veteran with 24-years of experience in the U.S. Navy, spent 18 months raising and training an assistance dog with the hope that he would be placed with a veteran. Larson, an entrepreneur, managed the construction of an outpatient clinic for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Both wanted and needed to further serve veterans and together, they created Veterans Moving Forward.

" In a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, Michèle Flournoy, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, testified that the development of Afghanistan’s security forces is on track. “We are meeting our growth goals and are continuing to improve quality and performance,” Flournoy said. She also commented that the Afghan National Army and National Police “are stepping up to take more responsibility in the field, enabling both the transition process … and the drawdown of our surge forces to [proceed].” Flournoy credits NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan for many of the improvements in the security forces and believes that the initiative will be the key to a successful transition in Afghanistan. Training and mentoring programs are reducing the shortage of trained noncommissioned officers, Flournoy said, and the Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) noncommissioned officer and officer corps grew by more than 20,000 new leaders over the past two years. The ANSF’s goal is to have 305,000 soldiers and police on hand in October. NATO forces also continue to focus on raising Afghan units’ literacy and improving operational performance rates. The training command estimates that the Afghan security forces will achieve 50 percent overall literacy rates at the third-grade level next year, with more than 70,000 police and 55,900 soldiers receiving some level of literacy training. The current literacy rate for 18- to -40-year-olds is 14 percent. Twelve new specialty schools also train Afghans in a number of fields including engineering, intelligence, logistics and human resources. “Of equal importance has been the effort to improve the ANSF’s operational performance in the field,” Flournoy said. In January, 124 Afghan battalions and headquarters elements were rated as effective with coalition advisors or assistance, the undersecretary said. “As of August, there are now 147 units with these ratings out of 184 units assessed, and we expect that trend to continue, if not accelerate,” Flournoy added. DynCorp International’s Training and Mentoring business area assists the NATO Training Mission – Afghanistan/Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (NTM-A/CSTC-A) by providing specialized training and mentoring services for the Afghanistan Ministry of Interior (MoI) and Afghan National Police (ANP). DI also provides logistics and life support components for 14 training facilities in Afghanistan and also provides similar mentoring and training services to the Afghan Ministry of Defense (MoD) and Afghan National Army (ANA). NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan/Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, in coordination with NATO nations and partners, international organizations, donors and non-governemental organizations (NGOs) supports Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) as it generates and sustains the Afghan National Security Force, develops leaders, and establishes enduring institutional capacity to enable accountable Afghan-led security.",Public
" DynCorp International employees participated in Welcome Home a Hero Day at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) on Saturday, September 24. The Welcome Home a Hero Program was established to encourage and support deployed military members. Approximately 150 to 275 troops come through DFW airport every day on their way home for two weeks of rest and recuperation (R&R). A small portion of these troops meet their families at the airport in Texas, while the majority will catch connecting flights home. Volunteers gather each day to be there to welcome these troops off their flight, thanking and encouraging them for their service to the U.S. The majority of those arriving are coming from Afghanistan and Iraq. Volunteers typically arrive dressed in red, white and blue with signs of encouragement, balloons and American flags. Visit the Welcome Home a Hero Program’s Facebook page for updates and more information. DFW has assisted thousands of men and women since the first R&R flight arrived in November of 2004. Members of the community are invited to greet the arriving troops at the Airport and to continue this proud tradition of supporting the U.S. Armed Forces. Past participants include corporations, youth groups, schools, civic organizations, religious groups and individuals. One flight of returning soldiers lands at DFW every day and the warm welcome provided by volunteer greeters begins the troops’ visit on a high note. Located halfway between the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, DFW International Airport is the world’s third flights per day and serving 57 million passengers a year. For four consecutive years, DFW has ranked in the top five for customer service among large airports worldwide in surveys conducted by Airports Council International.

" ABC News crew members were on hand four years ago as current DynCorp International employee Mark Little suffered what he calls the worst day of his life. Then a 2nd Lt. in the Army, Little was serving in Iraq when he was injured by a roadside bomb – eventually causing him to lose both his legs. The bomb detonated as he was making his way to deliver supplies. While his injury may have devastated most, ABC News captured a then 24-year-old who hadn’t lost his sense of humor, even during an incredibly difficult moment. Even while suffering, he joked about what his mother’s initial reaction would be. “I had been underplaying what I was actually doing in the deployment, ‘oh I am sitting around in a secure area, I am working in a warehouse,’ not to worry her, I thought this going to be trouble, she is going to know I wasn’t sitting in a warehouse,” Little recalls. In his recent interview with ABC News, Little was just as positive and light hearted as he was the day of the incident, but this time standing proudly on prosthetic legs. “It’s just the way I am,” Little says. “It’s easier to smile than cry and you don’t accomplish anything by complaining.” Beyond his personal accomplishments of not only getting back to an active lifestyle running, walking and even playing hockey, Little participates in the 46th Special Forces Company (ABN) Association and USA Warriors Ice Hockey team. The 46th Special Forces Company (ABN) Association, which operates out of Thailand, raises money for Wounded Warriors to travel on R&R with their families. The association sells Purple Heart shirts and hats through their online store and is able to send families on cruises and other vacation destinations. Little also participates in the USA Warriors Ice Hockey Program, which operates exclusively for charitable and educational purposes, for wounded United States Military personnel in conjunction with the USA Disabled Hockey Program. The non-profit program provides a recreational, therapeutic and motivating experience for participants while educating the general public about disability sports and sacrifices made by the U.S. military. “There is a reason for everything that happened that way,” Little says. “And during that process of forming who I am right now, as I sit here to talk to you, I got more of the traits that my wife fell in love with, so imagine had that not happened, we’d be sitting here on very different terms, decidedly single and unhappy, versus what I am right now, which is the happiest I could imagine, nothing could be better.” Today, Little works with DynCorp International in the Intelligence Training & Solutions business area. Darin Powers, VP, Intelligence Training & Solutions, said of Little, “He is an amazing individual and we are honored to have him as part of our staff.”",Public

" “The aviation business has some great discriminators, the keys are its history and its people,” said Catherine Gridley, vice president of Aviation for DynCorp International. “The history goes back to the early 50s when we first started performing aviation maintenance. The people who work here are also incredibly skilled – from wrench turning to understanding the mission we support. DI employees really provide a value added level of commitment not only to the company but the customer’s mission. I think that when you look at what aviation has to offer and brings to the customer it’s that history, knowledge, experience base and the commitment to what we need to do for the customer that makes us different.” DynCorp International LLC has its origins with two companies formed in 1946 — Land-Air, Inc., and California Eastern Airways. Land-Air, Inc., which became the predecessor to DynCorp International’s Maintenance and Technical Support Services (MTSS) Division, reached a major milestone in 1951, when it was awarded the first Contract Field Teams (CFT) contract by the Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC). Contract Field Teams provide mission support and depot-level repair to U.S. military aircraft and weapons systems worldwide. DynCorp International and its predecessors have provided services under the CFT program continuously since being awarded that first contract. The Contract Field Teams (CFT) Program accomplishes depot, intermediate and organizational level inspection, maintenance, modification and repair at operational Government locations worldwide. The program supports Air Force requirements at each of the Air Logistics Centers (ALCs), Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Air Force Reserves (AFRES) and Air National Guard (ANG). CFT contracts are also used to support requirements generated by the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other Federal agencies. The CFT program provides a rapid deployment capability to field necessary skilled technicians on site anywhere in the free world to support the Government’s war readiness and posture planning needs. Quantity of the services required is determined at the time the requirement is generated and will be cited on each order. Team requirements have been for as little as one to as many as a thousand technicians. DynCorp International continues to win contracts under the CFT program. This year, DynCorp International has won CFT programs for support of the US Navy Fleet Readiness Center Aviation Support Equipment program, support to the US Army’s 101st at Ft. Campbell and in July, the USAF awarded DI the Regional Aviation Support Management – West (RASM-W) task order and the Fort Drum Directorate of Logistics (DOL) Aviation Logistics Management Division (ALMD) task order. This August, DI won a contract with the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command to provide aviation maintenance and logistic support at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division in Patuxent River, Md.",Public
" DynCorp International firefighters from the Camp Leatherneck Fire Department joined troops from across Regional Command Southwest to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and honor those lost while assisting victims. Their 9/11 cookout was featured in Defense Video & Imagery Distribution Systems News. “We try to do cookouts periodically to give back to the military members … to say thank you,” said Jaime J. Jimenez, Camp Leatherneck Fire Department chief and DynCorp International employee. “When the firefighters came to me and said that they wanted to do one on the 9/11 anniversary, I said we should do it … and the support we’ve had from all units around the camp has been incredible.” “It is an honor for me to serve alongside troops out here in Afghanistan because I know what it’s like to wear the uniform,” explained Jimenez, who retired after twenty years as a firefighter in the U.S. Air Force. “I thank God every day for having the opportunity to be out here protecting them and helping them, just because they protect us every day.” Keeping the memories alive can be very emotional for some, but for the troops and firefighters at the event, it was a moment to feel proud and focus on the mission and duty, Jimenez affirmed. Michael J. Gaul, also a DI employee and Camp Leatherneck Fire Department captain, shared his thoughts. “September 11th is a very emotional day for all the firefighters, to remember the 343 firefighters who gave their lives during 9/11 … they are in our memories,” explained Gaul. “But events like this cookout will help us keep all the people who passed away during the attack in our minds.” “The idea is to share in commemoration of the 10 years and enjoy time together to think back and remember why we are here,” Gaul said. The Camp Leatherneck Fire Department serves as first responders to various crises on the 1,600-acre base located in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. The fire department works closely with the Combined Aid Station and Provost Marshall’s Office to serves the military and civilian contractor outfits on base. Jaime J. Jimenez and Michael J.

" DynCorp International (DI) today announced that it has been awarded a contract with the United States Navy for the operation and maintenance of Communication Suites aboard Military Sealift Command vessels. “We are honored that the U.S. Navy has chosen us for this important contract, expanding our relationship with the Navy and highlighting our experience in the communications space,” said George Krivo, vice president of DI’s Operations and Maintenance Business area. The competitively-awarded, fixed-price contract has one base year and four option years with a total contract value of $20.9 million if all options are exercised. This is the third consecutive award of this program to the company; the first award of this contract to the company was in July 2001, for five years, with a second follow-on award in Oct 2006, again for five years. Under the new contract, DI will provide operations and maintenance services on three maritime prepositioning squadrons and up to nine Joint High Speed Vessels (JHSV), with the first JHSV beginning October 1, 2011 out of Mobile, Ala. The U.S. Navy’s Military Sealift Command (MSC) is the premier provider of ocean transportation to the Department of Defense. The command operates approximately 110 noncombatant, civilian-crewed ships that replenish U.S. Navy ships, conduct specialized missions, strategically preposition combat cargo at sea around the world and move military cargo and supplies used by deployed U.S. forces and coalition partners. MSC is organized around four mission areas representing their primary operations: MSC’s mission is to support the U.S. by delivering supplies and conducting specialized missions across the world’s oceans. A Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) is capable of transporting personnel, equipment and supplies in support of maneuver and sustainment operations. The JHSV would be able to transport Army and Marine Corps company-sized units with their vehicles, or reconfigure to become a troop transport for an infantry battalion. The JHSV would include a flight deck for helicopter operations and an off-load ramp that would allow vehicles to quickly drive off the ship. The Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) would operate at speeds up to four times greater than the current fleet. This would provide the Army with the capability to support operational maneuver from standoff distance, bypass land-based choke-points, and reduce the logistics footprint in the Area of Responsibility. This ability to transport both troops and their equipment, and to provide an En route Mission Planning and Rehearsal System, did not previously exist.",Public
" From the UAE to Fort Bliss, Afghanistan to Fort Campbell, DynCorp International’s Operations and Maintenance business strengthens programs all over the world. DI performs maintenance, modifications, training and base operating support – just to name a few in the wide array of services provided by the Operations and Maintenance team.

" The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently released a study on the staffing approaches of federal agencies to determine best practices and recommendations for facility security staffing. What did they find? Among other things, there are great benefits to utilizing contract security services, including cost savings and flexibility. DynCorp International’s Security Services exhibits those benefits in action, with the ability to deliver flexible and rapidly-deployable, integrated security solutions to suit any situation in any part of the world. The Federal Protective Service (FPS) within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides security and law enforcement services to more than 9,000 federal facilities. In order to improve FPS’s security workforce management, GAO examined: nine federal agencies’ approaches for staffing security workforce, views on benefits and challenges of using contract vs. in-house security staff and lessons FPS can learn from other agencies that have changed their security staffing procedures. The study found that utilizing contract security staff had key benefits, including cost savings and personnel flexibility. Potential cost savings were based on several factors: Personnel flexibility was also reported as a benefit of using contract security staff, including the flexibility to adjust and deploy security staff levels to meet immediate needs.

" Those who serve on DynCorp International’s Training and Mentoring programs, often say that the individual contributions they are able to make while serving on mission are the most significant part of the job. DynCorp International employees in the Training and Mentoring program not only take pride in serving as advisors, trainers and mentors to local and national forces all over the world but also in the small day-to-day efforts that support overall mission goals. The people of DynCorp International embrace our core values – we serve, we care, we empower, we perform and we do the right thing. While in the field, DI employees exemplify these core values through their individual contributions in the community. “One of the most rewarding parts of working overseas is working with the community; not just the place, the entire community,” said Matt Wilber, an international police officer working with DynCorp International. “In one mission, a school was totally falling apart – no roof, no windows, no furniture. So, I got donations from my family, and I kicked in money and we had the school totally rebuilt. It was one of the nicest schools in the country after that,” said Wilber, of his experience in Afghanistan. Chad Guinther, another international police officer with DynCorp International, describes his experience in Sudan. “Everybody that was actually in Sudan with me at the time working with DynCorp, always had their pet projects,” said Guinther. “Some people took it upon themselves to buy biscuits and hand them out to the kids that were always running around.

" DynCorp International LLC, ranked 12th this year, up from 23rd in 2010, on the 18th Annual Washington Technology Top 100. Despite challenges in the government contracting industry, the company earned a spot in the top 20 with $3 billion in prime contracts, a renewed focus on partnerships, and a jump in work from the federal government agencies. Highlighting the fact that the company’s services have diversified, now meeting key needs of all U.S. global engagement across defense, development and diplomacy, DynCorp International president Steven Schorer commented, “We’ve positioned ourselves for transition.” Dyncorp International recently acquired Casals and Associates, now DI Development, to increase the company’s reach in international development; and Phoenix Consulting Group, now its Intelligence Training and Solutions business area, which brings the company into the intel space. DynCorp International can also attribute its success to continuing work in the Aviation business area. For decades the people of DI have supported critical military and commercial aviation needs around the world with end-to-end services and support. “It started out as a predominately aviation services company, and that heritage still exists today,” Schorer said. “That legacy lives on.” DynCorp International’s Aviation team is also known for servicing the presidential fleet at Andrews Air Force Base, which includes about 28 airplanes that support the president’s Cabinet.

" Major General Jeffrey Buchanan, Director of Strategic Effects, J9, was at the Center for a New American Security headquarters in Washington, D.C. last week to discuss “Operation New Dawn: Bridge to an Enduring Partnership.” In his discussion, he described his experience in training police forces in Iraq, the improvements in the Iraqi police force and implications for the future. “Month to month, year to year, it is very rewarding because you see the changes from a long term perspective. The light bulbs do, in fact, go off. So the Iraqi military and security forces we have now are very different than the ones we saw in the past. This is one of the things that causes me to be hopeful for the future,” said Buchanan of his experience working with Iraqi police officers. Buchanan also made remarks on specific examples of how Iraqi police has improved, citing, “they recognize and they regularly take on what their weaknesses are, what their needs are. They look at their performance very closely when they conduct operations and maybe even more importantly, when it doesn’t go well,” said Buchanan. “What they do now is a pretty thorough critique of themselves and apply what they learn.” Buchanan attributes the developments in Iraq to having the right personnel on site, proper preparation and the importance of training during this transition. Buchanan previously served as the Senior Light Infantry Trainer for the National Training Center, the Director of Combat Development at the U.S. Army Infantry Center where he deployed as the Director of Operations, Coalition Military Assistance Training Team, an organization charged with manning, training, and equipping the Iraqi Armed Forces. In 2005, he deployed with elements of the 2nd Brigade, 75th Division (Training Support) in Iraq, where he served on the Special Police Transition Teams for the Iraqi Police Commando Division.

These issues relate to U.S. export controls as mandated by law for national security, foreign policy, non-proliferation, and short supply reasons. The expertise and direct input of PECSEA’s members are vital to provide advice and recommendations on possible ways to minimize any adverse export controls imposed on U.S. industry; especially with the fact that PECSEA’s representatives are from the broad range of industries that are directly affected by export controls. DI supports the improvement and development of matters related to security and global competitiveness. For more information, visit DynCorp International.",Public
" In January 2011, DynCorp International (DI) was one of the first companies in the government services sector to receive the Capability Maturity Model® Integration for Services (CMMI-SVC) Capability Level 3 for not only its program management system, but also for the support and organizational processes across the company’s two major operating segments, Global Stabilization and Development Solutions, and Global Platform Support Solutions. Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute (SEI), in partnership with the Department of Defense, developed the CMMI as a process improvement model to provide a blueprint for companies to develop and improve their project management processes. Under the best circumstances, the practices in the model itself focus on ways to provide quality services to a company’s customers and end users. “This is a huge achievement for our company, providing tremendous value to our customers,” said Steve Gaffney, DynCorp International LLC chairman and CEO. “As one of the few government services providers to achieve this rating across our business, it is a testament to our commitment to excellence and reinforces our competitive position.” If you are interested in learning more about DI in the government services sector contact DynCorp International today.",Public
