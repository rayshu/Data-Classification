This second generation of sustainability goals includes additional reductions in operational carbon emissions by 15%; achieving sustainable status on film and TV productions; promoting the transition from physical to digital production and distribution; and using the studio's global reach to raise environmental awareness and inspire sustainable practices among employees and beyond. The studio has already become a zero waste lot (in 2011), cut overall carbon emissions more than 20% from 2006 levels, and achieved its first wave of environmental goals, set in 2008 when the studio launched the ""Sony Pictures A Greener World"" initiative. ""Sony Pictures has made incredible progress in creating a more sustainable organization, across every part of the company from production to distribution, which is not only beneficial to our bottom line but increasingly valuable to our global employee population, our partners and customers around the world,"" said Michael Lynton, CEO, Sony Entertainment, Inc. and Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment. ""Through our environmental sustainability efforts, we have an opportunity to make a real, positive difference to the business and, ultimately, to the world, and maybe inspire some people along the way,"" added Amy Pascal, Co-Chairman, Sony Pictures Entertainment and Chairman of Sony Pictures Motion Pictures Group. Highlights of Sony Pictures' environmental sustainability efforts include: In 2001, Sony Pictures Entertainment was certified ISO14000, which is the environmental management standard defined by the International Organization for Standardization (http://www.iso.org/iso/about.htm). The ISO 14000 reinforces sound environmental practices by requiring certified companies to have programs and procedures in place that support recycling efforts, hazardous waste management, and natural resource conservation. Sony Pictures was recertified to the updated ISO14001 standard in 2005, has maintained it each year since, and expanded certification to an additional six sites worldwide. To date, it remains the first and only major US studio certified to this standard of environmental practice.  For more information on Sony Pictures A Greener World, visit www.sonypictures.com/green.

""With Eko, Yoni and the team at Interlude have developed an elegant, innovative storytelling platform. We look forward to working with them, and Will Gluck, to engage audiences with completely new entertainment experiences,"" said Michael Lynton, CEO, Sony Entertainment.   The Eko platform includes substantial breakthroughs in real time seamless video and audio, as well as user-response technologies.  These all have been invented by Interlude's team to serve the creative needs of artists using this new medium. Moreover, with a new, active relationship between the story and consumers, Eko enables media companies and brands to benefit from unprecedented viewer engagement.  ""We are very excited to launch this partnership with Sony Pictures,"" said Yoni Bloch, Co-Founder and CEO of Interlude. ""We look forward to introducing Eko experiences to many more viewers and to offering new business approaches to fuel the best creative and business returns for our partners.""  ""I'm thrilled to be working with Sony and Interlude to contribute to the evolving landscape of entertainment,"" said Will Gluck, whose Los Angeles-based Olive Bridge Entertainment will spearhead the endeavor.  ""We look forward to working with inventive writers and directors to create compelling storytelling that will match Interlude's innovative technology."" SPE's investment follows other recent Interlude developments, which include new versions of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""War Games"", in partnership with CBS and MGM respectively. Eko is also a partner with Warner Music Group on ""Clash Up,"" an interactive music series that lets users create their own multi-genre mix in real time, and other music related content.  These new collaborations will join the existing and new content launched on Eko (www.helloeko.com) and will range from music to comedy, drama, mysteries, thrillers and new genres that take special advantage of the Eko medium.

" CULVER CITY, CA (May 10, 2013) - Virgin Produced, the film and television arm of the Virgin Group, has teamed up with Overbrook Entertainment on a non-exclusive pact, which will support the After Earth franchise, starting with the upcoming May 31st release, it was announced today by Jason Felts, CEO of Virgin Produced, and James Lassiter of Overbrook Entertainment. This pact allows Virgin Produced the option to co-produce, co-finance and co-market a sequel to After Earth.  The two companies will look to develop film and television properties together, in which Virgin Produced would co-produce and market across its expansive global platforms. The pact marks a natural relationship for both Virgin Produced and Overbrook as it reinforces both companies' missions: to find projects that entertain as well as educate, with ideas that leap off the entertainment page and into the national conversation. As Overbrook's After Earth shares many of the themes that Virgin is committed to: it focuses on the future that awaits the human race if it continues on its destructive environmental path and raises important questions about the present state of the planet, the future, and the environment. As one of the most respected talent friendly brands, it is anticipated that the alignment with Overbrook is the first in several talent owned production company alignments as Virgin Produced increases its growth under the direction of co-founder Jason Felts.  Commenting on the announcement, Felts said, ""This deal makes perfect sense for us, both in a thematic sense and as a company.  At Virgin, we believe it's important to give mankind a heightened awareness of the nature and vulnerability of our planet.  For example, we have to travel to space to look down and see how fragile the earth is; certainly, the film takes that message to heart in both literal and figurative ways.  As a company, we saw the opportunity to team up with one of the industry's leading film and television production companies that also embraces this mission.  That's why we're excited to partner with Overbrook on future films.” Lassiter added, ""We are excited for the opportunity to join forces with Virgin Produced.  We believe they share our ultimate goal: to create entertainment that also uplifts and educates.  Simply, we both believe that entertainment can be a force for good in the world - and we think both companies are leaders in that aspect.  That's why this deal is a natural fit."" Virgin Produced, with a focus on quality product, is breaking the mold amongst producers / production companies with the ability to attract top talent and market its movies across Virgin's global marketing platform. Virgin Produced, since its inception in 2010, has co-produced and marketed a half-dozen films, primarily through its former overall deal with Relativity Media, which now has Virgin Produced operating independently. In After Earth, a crash landing leaves teenager Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) and his legendary father Cypher (Will Smith) stranded on Earth 1,000 years after cataclysmic events forced humanity's escape. With Cypher critically injured, Kitai must embark on a perilous journey to signal for help, facing uncharted terrain, evolved animal species that now rule the planet, and an unstoppable alien creature that escaped during the crash. Father and son must learn to work together and trust one another if they want any chance of returning home. Columbia Pictures presents an Overbrook Entertainment/Blinding Edge Pictures production directed by M. Night Shyamalan from a screenplay by Gary Whitta and M. Night Shyamalan and a story by Will Smith, and produced by Caleeb Pinkett, Jada Pinkett Smith & Will Smith, James Lassiter, and M. Night Shyamalan. ABOUT VIRGIN PRODUCEDVirgin Produced serves as the film and television development, packaging and production arm of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. Led by co-founders CEO Jason Felts and Chief Creative Officer Justin Berfield, Virgin Produced is breaking the corrosive models of Old Hollywood by providing a collaborative environment that embraces talent so they can best create and inspire. Putting quality and innovation first, with an equal focus on television and film, Virgin Produced has co-produced box office successes Limitless and Immortals, Movie 43 and its most recent release, comedy 21 & Over. Virgin Produced recently produced the award winning short film Departure Date. In April 2012, Virgin Produced launched its own television network, the Virgin Produced Channel, which programs high quality lifestyle, music, travel, technology and comedy content to Virgin operating companies in the transportation, mobile, broadband, radio, health club, hotel and retail industries estimated to reach 60+ million loyal Virgin brand fans globally on a daily basis. ABOUT OVERBROOK ENTERTAINMENTOverbrook Entertainment, founded by partners James Lassiter, Will Smith and run along with partner Jada Pinkett Smith, is committed to offering the highest quality entertainment focused in film and television and has produced a diverse slate of both critically acclaimed and blockbuster feature films, which have generated more than $2.5 billion dollars in worldwide box office receipts and even more in home video sales.

CULVER CITY, Calif., January 11, 2010  - Peter Parker is going back to high school when the next Spider-Man hits theaters in the summer of 2012. 
		 
Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced today they are moving forward with a film based on a script by James Vanderbilt that focuses on a teenager dealing with both contemporary human problems and amazing super-human crises. 
The new chapter in the Spider-Man franchise produced by Columbia, Marvel Studios and Avi Arad and Laura Ziskin, will have a new cast and filmmaking team. Spider-Man 4 was to have been released in 2011, but had not yet gone into production.	 
""A decade ago we set out on this journey with Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire and together we made three Spider-Man films that set a new bar for the genre. When we began, no one ever imagined that we would make history at the box-office and now we have a rare opportunity to make history once again with this franchise. Peter Parker as an ordinary young adult grappling with extraordinary powers has always been the foundation that has made this character so timeless and compelling for generations of fans. We're very excited about the creative possibilities that come from returning to Peter's roots and we look forward to working once again with Marvel Studios, Avi Arad and Laura Ziskin on this new beginning,"" said Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. 
""Working on the Spider-Man movies was the experience of a lifetime for me. While we were looking forward to doing a fourth one together, the studio and Marvel have a unique opportunity to take the franchise in a new direction, and I know they will do a terrific job,"" said Sam Raimi. 
""We have had a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration and friendship with Sam and Tobey and they have given us their best for the better part of the last decade.This is a bittersweet moment for us because while it is hard to imagine Spider-Man in anyone else's hands, I know that this was a day that was inevitable,"" said Matt Tolmach, president of Columbia Pictures, who has served as the studio's chief production executive since the beginning of the franchise. “Now everything begins anew, and that's got us all tremendously excited about what comes next.  Under the continuing supervision of Avi and Laura, we have a clear vision for the future of Spider-Man and can't wait to share this exciting new direction with audiences in 2012."" 
""Spider-Man will always be an important franchise for Sony Pictures and a fresh start like this is a responsibility that we all take very seriously,"" said Michael Lynton, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures.  ""We have always believed that story comes first and story guides the direction of these films. As we move onto the next chapter, we will stay true to that principle and will do so with the highest respect for the source material and the fans and moviegoers who deserve nothing but the best when it comes to bringing these stories and characters to life on the big screen.""   
The studio will have more news about Spider-Man in 2012 in the coming weeks as it prepares for production of the film.

The LOT Project included the construction of two new 100,000 square foot office buildings, named after Jack Cohn and Harry Cohn, and a parking structure located at the heart of the studio's historic lot based in Culver City, California. ""We are proud to receive this designation for our newest buildings on the lot,"" said Michael Lynton, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures.  ""It's our belief that we have a responsibility to help create a greener world for our community and future generations, and this project is an important part of our overall sustainability efforts."" ""We're excited to be recognized by such a respected international body,"" said Amy Pascal, Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures.  ""We're also gratified that the buildings and the park area between them have become a new ‘center of gravity' for our lot, a place where employees and visitors come to eat, exercise and meet with one another in an atmosphere that can be both relaxed and refreshing."" The Jack Cohn and Harry Cohn buildings, which were designed for Sony Pictures by Gensler Architecture with developer Georgetown Company and general contractor CW Driver, were recognized by USGBC for a number of factors related to their design and construction. Elements rated positively by USGBC include: the use of local and recycled building materials as well as diverting over 93 percent (16,128 tons) of construction waste material from landfills; the incorporation of onsite filtration system for storm water runoff and low-flow toilets and urinals; the use of low-emitting carpeting, paint, sealants, adhesives and wall coverings; the installation of motion detector lights and energy efficient light bulbs; the implementation of ""Green Housekeeping"" building maintenance standards; and the availability of preferred parking for low emitting and fuel efficient vehicles as well as car pools and van pools. In addition, the LOT Project included the construction of a state of the art, highly efficient central cooling plant. ""Naturally, a project of this size and scope was undertaken with a great deal of thought and care,"" said Jeff Hargleroad, Executive Vice President, Corporate Operations. ""We recognized early on this was a great opportunity to pursue design and construction practices that would map to our core values as a company; it became obvious that this was the right thing to do."" As the first and only studio to achieve ISO14001 certification (the international standard for managing an organizations impact on the environment), Sony Pictures Entertainment has had an established sustainability practice studio-wide since 2001. Led by Lynton and Pascal, the studio's emphasis on the pursuit of environmental sustainability has taken on a new energy in the past two years. Goals announced in the fall of 2008 include a commitment to go ""zero waste"" on the studio's main lot. A composting program in partnership with the City of Culver City has helped move the company significantly forward to meet that goal. In addition to the LEED building project and other facilities and operations initiatives, the studio is pursuing sustainable practices across production, consumer products, employee programs and community outreach.

" CULVER CITY, CA (July 15, 2011) - Sony Pictures Entertainment (http://www.sonypictures.com) has plans to install a major work of public art called ""Rainbow"" by renowned American multimedia artist Tony Tasset, it was announced today by Chairman and CEO Michael Lynton and Co-Chairman Amy Pascal. ""This is an exciting moment for us,"" Lynton remarked. ""Because this lot dates back nearly a century to the earliest days of film, we wanted to commission a work of art that honors our history and makes a lasting contribution to our studio, Culver City and the community-at-large.  We are grateful to Tony Tasset for his inspired vision and to the City for embracing it."" ""Culver City has this amazing emphasis on the value of art in the community, and we are thrilled to be able to deliver something as memorable as Tony's 'Rainbow' sculpture will be,"" said Pascal. ""The beauty of this iconic design is that it both harkens back to a wonderful era of filmmaking and celebrates the power of imagination that continues to inspire our work today."" The ""Rainbow"" concept by Tasset was approved unanimously by the Culver City Cultural Affairs Commission subcommittee on Tuesday, May 10.  ""Sony Pictures' decision to create something as remarkable as the 'Rainbow' on its lot is above-and-beyond our expectations of the Public Art requirement and speaks volumes about Sony's commitment to Culver City,"" said Mayor Micheál O'Leary. ""The City Council is pleased that the Cultural Affairs Commission overwhelmingly agreed to support this terrific project."" ""The Sony Pictures Studios lot has been integral to the history of the 'Heart of Screenland' since Thomas Ince established the working lot in 1915,"" said Julie Lugo Cerra, Culver City Historian. ""It's a thrill to see Sony Pictures adding to their contribution to Culver City's entertainment cultural heritage with this exciting project by such a talented artist."" Funding for the $1.6 million project comes in part from Sony Pictures' Public Art Requirement related to the studio's LOT construction project of two new office buildings and a parking lot, which opened in 2009 and were awarded last fall with LEED Gold Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council.  The design of the ""Rainbow"" involves a 94 by 188 foot steel rainbow that spans much of the distance between the studio's Main Street and the Madison Gate. It will be visible from a considerable distance from the lot in all directions.  ""This project presented a tremendous opportunity to connect present and past,"" said Tony Tasset. ""A rainbow provided a bridge both physically—arching across a section of the lot - and symbolically through its connection to specific films like 'The Wizard of Oz,' shot on the lot, and to light itself."" Creator of several major public works of art, Tasset has a history of celebrating global popular culture, while owing a debt to tradition, particularly the Light and Space art movement based in Southern California. For the concept of the ""Rainbow,"" Tasset was inspired by multiple factors including rainbows as a general symbol for optimism and well-being, as well as, specifically, their use in such iconic pieces of entertainment as ""The Wizard of Oz"" film, which was shot on the Sony Pictures Studios lot in the late 1930s. Providing stunning photo opportunities for visitors on the lot and visible from its northern edge, the sculpture will establish a new landmark for the studio and the city. Development of the ""Rainbow"" installation began in June, 2011, with construction to be completed entirely off site and installation at the lot expected in early 2012.

" CULVER CITY, Calif., January 22, 2013 - After 51 years in the entertainment industry and 32 years at Columbia Pictures, Gary Martin is retiring from his joint role as President, Production Administration, Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group and President, Sony Pictures Studios Operations. To honor Martin's 32-year tenure, Amy Pascal, Co-Chairman, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Michael Lynton, CEO, Sony Entertainment, Inc. have announced that Sony Pictures Studios will dedicate Stage 15 ""The Gary Martin Soundstage"" in his honor. Martin began his career in 1961 at 20th Century Fox and joined Columbia Pictures in 1981 as a Production Manager. In 1988, he was named Columbia Pictures' President of Production Administration, overseeing all aspects of physical and post production on Columbia's slate of films. Martin was additionally named President of Sony Pictures Studios Operations in 2003, assuming responsibility for the day to day operations of the entire studio lot and post production facilities, employing over 260 people. Commenting on the announcement, Pascal said, ""Gary is Sony Pictures and our studio operations. His leadership, grace, and skill are unparalleled in our business. There is no one who comes close. We are fortunate that Gary spent the better part of his 51 years here with us. He's not just our colleague, he is our great friend and we're going to miss seeing him every day. In his honor, we are dedicating our most storied sound stage - Stage 15."" Lynton added, ""We are so grateful for Gary's years of service here at the Studio. From the day I arrived through every day since, he has been a force of great leadership that is full of compassion, humility and humor. As Gary looks towards time to enjoy more of his life away from this lot later this year, we are confident that the phenomenal team he has in place will continue to maintain the high standards in our productions and our facilities that Gary set during his remarkable tenure."" In his career at Columbia Pictures, Martin has overseen the production of more than 600 films, including the blockbuster Spider-Man, Men In Black, and Ghostbusters franchises, as well as many of the studio's most celebrated modern classics like The Smurfs, The Social Network, Superbad, Casino Royale, Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Prince of Tides, and Tootsie. Among his many achievements, Martin was responsible for opening the lot's Barbara Streisand Scoring Stage and developing Sony Pictures Studios' Sound Department into a world-leading facility boasting a stable of Oscar®-winning Sound Mixers and Sound Supervisors. Martin also implemented Sony Pictures Studios' sustainability effort, turning the 30 acre facility into the first zero-waste studio lot in 2011. Martin will remain in the role, working with SPE's senior leadership team to determine plans for a successor in the coming months. Sony Pictures Studios' Stage 15, to be re-named ""The Gary Martin Soundstage,"" is the largest soundstage in North America and the second-largest in the world.

" NEW YORK (July 24, 2013) - Sony Pictures Classics announced today it will be releasing Alex Gibney's Lance Armstrong documentary, THE ARMSTRONG LIE worldwide.  The film, produced by Gibney, Frank Marshall and Matt Tolmach, tells the unfolding story of Armstrong's life and career over the last four years. Lance Armstrong was considered one of the greatest sports figures of all time and put competitive cycling into the global spotlight, by beating cancer and winning the Tour de France seven times.  That success earned him an immense fortune and worldwide fame.  His was also one of the most influential and inspiring sports stories of recent memory and became a pop culture phenomenon, thanks to his Livestrong initiative.  Beginning in 2009, Academy Award winning documentarian Alex Gibney followed Armstrong for four years chronicling his return to cycling after retirement, as he tried to win his eighth title.  Unexpectedly, Gibney was also there in 2012 when Armstrong admitted to doping, following a federal criminal investigation, public accusations of doping by his ex-teammates, and an investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency, that led USADA's CEO, Travis Tygart, to conclude that Armstrong's team had run ""the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen."" What began as the chronicle of a comeback became an examination into the anatomy of a lie.  This film offers unparalleled access to Armstrong's former teammates, doctors, and professionals, many of whom have never before spoken to the media about Armstrong and his bombshell doping admission - as well as unprecedented access to Armstrong himself. ""On this long-distance ride, full of unpredictable twists and turns, I learned a lot about one spectacular sport - cycling - as well as the ethic of winning at all costs that pervades most sports and society-at-large.   I'm very proud of the final film, grateful for the support and skill of my fellow producers and the legendary distribution team at Sony Pictures Classic,"" said Director Alex Gibney. Producers Frank Marshall and Matt Tolmach added, ""We set out to make a movie about a comeback -- with unlimited and unprecedented access to Armstrong and the inner-workings of the Tour de France.  Along the way, we ended up chronicling the collapse of one of the greatest myths and legends of our time."" ""Alex Gibney has made an amazing movie, more revealing and with greater detail, than anything yet seen on the major controversial subject we know as Lance Armstrong.  We are pleased to be working with Alex and producers Frank Marshall and Matt Tolmach in bringing this film to audiences worldwide,"" stated Sony Pictures Classics.

The film, which has also been chosen as the opening night selection of the New York Film Festival, will then enter wide release on October 9. Twelve men have walked on the moon. Only one man has ever, or will ever, go where The Walk will take moviegoers. In The Walk, Academy Award® winner Robert Zemeckis, the master director of such marvels as Forrest Gump, Cast Away, Polar Express and Flight, again uses cutting edge technology in the service of an emotional, character-driven story.

It is also one of the rare live-action films that is a PG-rated, all-audience entertainment for moviegoers 8 to 80 - and a true story to boot. It is unlike anything audiences have seen before, a love letter to Paris and New York City in the 1970s, but most of all, to the Towers of the World Trade Center. Commenting on the announcement, Greg Foster, Senior Executive Vice President of IMAX Corp. and CEO of IMAX Entertainment, said, ""We're excited to be part of Sony's exclusive release for The Walk, which was designed for and makes brilliant use of IMAX 3D.

As we began assembling the footage for the motion picture we realized we captured something extraordinary, unique and very special. It's a very private, exclusive look into a creative genius's world. For the first time ever, fans will see Michael as they have never seen him before - this great artist at work. It is raw, emotional, moving and powerful footage that captures his interactions with the THIS IS IT collaborators that he had personally assembled for this once in a lifetime project. This film shows a consummate performer working with and guiding singers, dancers, band members, choreographers, special effects creators and countless other creative members of the team as we all assemble this historic concert.  I can think of many words to describe Michael as he rehearses for and creates THIS IS IT - inspirational, dynamic, generous, dedicated, loving and the guiding force - you see him as the true architect and driving force of this project - a true master of his craft, the Entertainer of Entertainers.  I'm proud of the many years of friendship and creative association I shared with Michael and I'm happy that people will get a chance to see his spirit and drive in action. THIS IS IT may go down as the greatest concert that no one got a chance to see, but with this film, we get a rare portrait of Michael as he prepares for his final curtain call and what I believe was going to be his master work.""
		 
Michael Jackson THIS IS IT will offer Jackson fans and music lovers worldwide a rare, behind-the-scenes look at the performer as he developed, created and rehearsed for his sold-out concerts that would have taken place beginning this summer in London's O2 Arena.

" 
LAS VEGAS, NV, March 15, 2010  -  The nation's theater owners were asked today by the head of a major Hollywood studio to have healthier snacks at their concession stands in addition to their traditional offerings of candy, popcorn and soda. 
In a speech at ShoWest, the nation's largest convention for the movie theater industry, Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman and CEO Michael Lynton said, ""adding healthier options to your existing menu is the right thing to do for our industry, for audiences and for our country."" 
Lynton said a poll of moviegoers commissioned by Sony Pictures revealed: 
Lynton said he was not asking theaters to stop selling popcorn, soda and candy.  ""Audiences love them"" he said.  ""I'm just talking about adding some healthier items to what you already sell."" 
Lynton also announced that the Alliance for a Healthier Generation has offered to meet with the theater owners ""and offer advice on how to change your menus in a way that makes sense for your audiences and your business."" 
""The private sector, including the theatre industry, has the ability to improve the access families have to healthier foods and beverages,"" said President Bill Clinton, founder of the William J. Clinton Foundation, who co-leads the Alliance for a Healthier Generation with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and American Heart Association President Clyde Yancy.  ""The Alliance brokered voluntary agreements with the beverage industry that resulted in an 88 percent decrease in beverage calories shipped to America's schools in just a few years. We are eager to work with the movie theater industry to craft similar agreements to provide healthy concession options in movie theaters."" 
""In order to turn the tide on the obesity epidemic we are going to need to make soup to nuts changes in the number of calories we take in and the calories we actively use. Because kids are eating and foraging at home, school, sporting events and at the movies, changes are needed everywhere,"" said Dr. Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics, public health and public policy at UCLA and director of the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities. ""We can't expect kids to make healthy choices if they aren't given healthy choices to make. And while this is a nationwide problem, and will require support from companies with a national stature like Sony Pictures and large theater chains, it will also depend on the ingenuity and commitment of local theater operators to make the difference in their communities."" 
In a videotaped message to the convention, Dr. Mehmet Oz, vice chair and professor of surgery at Columbia University and host of The Dr. Oz Show, said, ""Everyone enjoys popcorn and a soda at the movies, but there are healthier alternatives. Good nutrition doesn't mean eating spinach at every meal. But with so many children and teens going to movies so often these days, I think we've got to be mindful about what they're eating and drinking, and giving them the chance to choose healthier food makes a lot of sense."" 
Lynton said theater owners should consider taking this step because childhood obesity is an epidemic, it's the responsible thing to do for audiences and society, and it's good for their business because it would help families enjoy theaters even more and, by giving them healthier options, more snacks will be purchased. 
Regarding what kinds of snacks might be offered at theaters, Lynton said, ""I don't think giant tubs of spinach or broccoli's a good idea.  And nobody wants to eat cauliflower while watching Spider-Man, or drink a 40-ounce cup of prune juice."" 
He said moviegoers suggested to the studio's interviewers the kind of snacks they'd like to see: 
Lynton said some people sneak healthy snacks into movie theaters, like a granola bar or a box of raisins, which represents an untapped market for concession stands.  ""People are consuming food differently these days.  In fact, many of your theaters are located near Starbucks and Whole Foods and in malls and other places where consumers are now finding more nutritious food and beverage options.  Audiences would love both a great theatrical experience and terrific snacks.""		 
Lynton said employees at Sony Pictures are offered a subsidized healthy lunch special and expanded salad bar at the studio commissary.  He noted some theaters are moving in the direction of offering healthier foods; some use canola oil instead of coconut oil for their popcorn.  He also said he understands that some things ""will prove to be logistically or economically impossible...But even small steps in the right direction can have a big impact.""

While we are excited to be back in the Bond business, we also look forward to future collaborations and I am confident that this agreement will be long-term, lucrative, and beneficial to both studios."" ""After successfully working on the re-launch of the James Bond franchise with Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, we could not be more proud or privileged to continue our association with Barbara Broccoli, Michael G. Wilson, Daniel Craig, and the talented teams at EON and MGM,"" said Pascal.

" LOS ANGELES, CA., August 5, 2012 - Alembic 1.1, the open source project jointly developed by Sony Pictures Imageworks (SPI) and Lucasfilm Ltd. released its newest improvements and updates at this year's ACM SIGGRAPH Conference. Joint development of Alembic was first announced at SIGGRAPH 2010 and Alembic 1.0 was released to the public at the 2011 ACM SIGGRAPH Conference in Vancouver. The software focuses on efficiently storing and sharing animation and visual effects scenes across multiple software applications. Since the software's debut last year both companies have integrated the technology into their production pipelines. ILM notably using the software for their work on the 2012 blockbuster The Avengers and Sony Pictures Imageworks on the 2012 worldwide hits Men in Black 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man in addition to the upcoming animated feature Hotel Transylvania, scheduled for release September 28, 2012.

Alembic is gathering momentum and we think it is solving a real problem for our customers."" Here's what some of the other leading solution providers are also saying about Alembic: ""Over the last year Alembic support has broadened across The Foundry's own product lines as well as spreading in a wave across the industry. Getting data exchange right is hugely important, and rapid Alembic adoption has become a breath of fresh air for software vendors and their customers.""

Exocortex and our clients, though the ""Exocortex Crate"" suite of Alembic tools for 3DS Max, Softimage, Maya and Arnold, are proud to be on the front lines of this transformation. This transformation would not be possible if it weren't for the leadership of Lucasfilm and Sony, the strong design of the core Alembic library and the first class support from Alembic's developers.""
- Ben Houston, CTO, Exocortex ""We are pleased to bring the Alembic-Arnold integration up-to-date with Arnold 4.0. Alembic's fast, compact format and data de-duplication are a natural fit for Arnold procedurals and instancing. We are excited to see increasing industry adoption of Alembic in conjunction with Arnold. Solid Angle stands firmly behind Alembic and will continue to contribute to its development.""

" CULVER CITY, Calif., January 27, 2015 - Jeff Robinov's Fosun-backed Studio 8, together with Chinese distribution company Bona Film Group, will partner with Tom Rothman's TriStar and Film4 on the adaptation of Ben Fountain's acclaimed novel Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, to be directed by three-time Oscar®-winner Ang Lee. The deal brings together several members of the family of companies at Sony Pictures, which will distribute the film worldwide, except for Greater China, which Bona Film Group Ltd will handle. Film 4 will have UK free television. The film is now set for start of principal photography in mid-April and casting is underway. In the film, Bravo Company, and 19-year-old private Billy Lynn, survive a harrowing Iraq battle that is captured by news cameras. They are brought home by the US administration for a promotional tour, culminating at the spectacular halftime show of a Thanksgiving Day football game, all while facing an imminent return to the war.  Almost the entire movie takes place during the day of the game, with flashes back to the underlying events and Billy's heroism. The film will explore new methods, both technological and artistic, with the goal of further engaging the audience.  Lee will use the Sony F65 camera shooting in native 3D, high resolution, and with an ultra-high frame rate to create a different cinematic syntax in service of the story.  He envisions creating a new way for audiences to experience drama, including the heightened sensation that soldiers really feel on the battlefield and on the home front. Commenting on the announcement, Rothman said, ""Ang is pushing the envelope even beyond what we achieved in Life of Pi. Innovation is key to getting audiences out to cinemas now, but such advances often take a brave village. I have long admired Jeff personally and have great respect for Studio 8 and Bona. It's a neat fit as we are all in the business of trying to do cool things for Sony, not to mention we park right next to each other."" Robinov added, ""Ang Lee's vision for this remarkable story is incredibly exciting to all of the partners involved and perfectly captures the types of filmmaker-driven movies we want to make at Studio 8. We are thankful that Tom Rothman included us in this fantastic project and are looking forward to working on this together."" Bona Founder, Chairman and CEO Mr. Yu Dong commented, ""Since last year, we've been working closely with our strategic partner Fosun to explore their resources in the entertainment industry as we roll out our international strategy to grow a significant presence in Hollywood. Having the opportunity to work on Ang Lee's next film and being the only partner in China speaks to our strong film production and distribution capabilities, as well as marks a very important first step for Bona to gain international recognition. We look forward to participating in more Hollywood mainstream films while at the same time bringing high-quality foreign films to the domestic market.""

" CULVER CITY, Calif., November 1, 2015 - Albert R. Broccoli's EON Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment announced today that SPECTRE has shattered box office records in nearly every market in which it has been released, led by a historic performance in the UK. In total in the six released territories, the film has taken in $80.4 million, including $67.7 million from SPRI territories and $12.7 million from territories in which MGM is distributing. In the UK, the film has opened to an estimated £41.7 million ($63.8 million USD) in its first seven days of release, securing new records for the biggest opening of all time in UK box office history. SPECTRE took the opening record from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which was also released on a Monday to £23.882 million. SPECTRE also achieved a new record for the highest seven-day gross in UK box office history, overtaking the last James Bond film, SKYFALL. SPECTRE, the 24th James Bond adventure, continues the longest running and most successful film franchise in cinema history. The film opened in 647 cinemas and on 2,500 screens, making it the widest release of all time in the UK and Ireland. The UK wasn't alone in shattering box office records as nearly every releasing market saw SPECTRE make history as the biggest box office opening of all-time. In the Netherlands, SPECTRE took in 3.3 million Euro ($3.7 million USD), surpassing the record set by Skyfall and bringing its cume to $3.9 million including previews. In the Nordic region, markets distributed by MGM, SPECTRE took in a total of $12.7 million USD, setting new opening records in Finland and Norway, both surpassing Skyfall - Finland took in 2.35 million Euro ($2.63 million USD), and Norway 24.4 million krone ($2.88 million USD). The film also set a new record in Denmark for the biggest three-day opening of all time, as SPECTRE took in 28.1 million krone ($4.21 million USD), also surpassing Skyfall. In Sweden, SPECTRE took in 24.95 million krone ($2.97 million USD), a spectacular result that is 30% over the opening of Skyfall. SPECTRE has also set a new IMAX record, recording the highest per-location average in IMAX history as the first film ever to top a $100,000 per-location average, with $105,000 in 47 IMAX locations. In response to the #1 UK opening, producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said, ""We're so grateful to all our James Bond fans and the British public for making SPECTRE's debut in the UK box office history!"" ""What an incredible thrill it is for us at MGM to see how James Bond continues to deliver such excitement to his fans. This record-breaking support from UK audiences for what is our 24th outing is nothing short of amazing. We can't wait for the rest of the world to see SPECTRE,"" said Gary Barber, MGM Chairman and CEO. Peter Taylor, Managing Director Sony Pictures UK, also commented ""We are delighted that audiences in the UK and Ireland continue to embrace these stories about one of our biggest and best cultural icons. This opening proves once again, that the film world of James Bond speaks to cinema-goers like no other."" ABOUT ""SPECTRE""
A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond (Daniel Craig) on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra (Monica Bellucci), the beautiful and forbidden widow of an infamous criminal. Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE. Meanwhile back in London, Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott), the new head of the Centre for National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6, led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) to help him seek out Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr White (Jesper Christensen), who may hold the clue to untangling the web of SPECTRE. As the daughter of an assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of SPECTRE, he learns of a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks, played by Christoph Waltz. Sam Mendes returns to direct SPECTRE, with Daniel Craig reprising his role as 007 for the fourth time. SPECTRE is produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The screenplay is by John Logan and Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth, with a story by John Logan and Neal Purvis & Robert Wade. About Albert R. Broccoli's EON Productions

From the precarious frozen waters of Russia's Lake Baikal to Miami in the throes of Hurricane Irma to Venezuela's mighty Angels Falls, water is AQUARELA's main character, with director Victor Kossakovsky capturing her many personalities in startling visual detail. ""For me, AQUARELA represents a personal journey that encapsulates every possible emotion - from joy and ecstasy to angst and awe - providing a unique lens that allows audiences to develop a deeper connection to the beauty and power of water in all its forms,"" Kossakovsky said. ""I am deeply grateful and excited to be working with Sony Classics; their track record for bringing thought-provoking and inspiring films like AQUARELA is unparalleled.""  Said Sony Pictures Classics, ""Victor Kossakosvky has created a mind-blowing experience on screen at 96 frames-per-second with AQUARELA and we are excited to share this powerful film and its message with audiences.""

Players take on the role of Phil Connors Jr., the charming but arrogant son of the original film’s protagonist. Returning to his hometown of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, Phil Jr. becomes trapped in a time loop just like his father before him. Players will solve puzzles, interact with new and familiar characters, and explore the town as they try to escape the time loop. “‘When audiences think of ‘Groundhog Day,’ they think of a day that goes on and on but not necessarily about an immersive game – that’s why it was thrilling to take that classic movie IP, develop it for virtual reality and surprise people with this title,” said Jake Zim, Senior Vice President of Virtual Reality at Sony Pictures Entertainment. “VR gives us a unique opportunity to take audiences inside beloved Sony Pictures properties like ‘Groundhog Day and share sequels to stories that otherwise might never get made. We hope new and longtime fans enjoy exploring the world of the film in a fresh and modern perspective.”
“As someone who grew up on this movie, I’m looking forward to fans like myself, along with new generations, discovering what it’s like to walk around Punxsutawney and be part of a new chapter in this story,” said Ethan Stearns, EVP of Content at MWMi. ""Telling gripping interactive stories is our focus at MWMi, and we look forward to players jumping into this hilarious, original narrative.""
“This was a rare opportunity to take an incredibly iconic IP and use it as a jumping-off point to explore modern ideas and themes,” said Raul Rubio, CEO and Creative Director of Tequila Works. “But ‘Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son’ is also just flat-out fun. It’s up to players to get Phil Jr. out of the mess he’s in, which leads to some comedic, irreverent and thrilling moments throughout the game.”
“Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son” is co-produced by SPVR and MWMi, leading creators of story-driven VR and interactive entertainment. The game is developed by Tequila Works, Madrid-based creators of award-winning video games including “Deadlight,” “RIME,” “The Sexy Brutale” and “The Invisible Hours.” “Groundhog Day: Like Father Like Son” is published by SPVR.

Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the producers of SPECTRE, added, ""We're astounded and thank all our fans worldwide for this incredible response to SPECTRE."" ABOUT ""SPECTRE""A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond (Daniel Craig) on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra (Monica Bellucci), the beautiful and forbidden widow of an infamous criminal.  Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE. Meanwhile back in London, Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott), the new head of the Centre for National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6, led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) to help him seek out Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr White (Jesper Christensen), who may hold the clue to untangling the web of SPECTRE. As the daughter of an assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of SPECTRE, he learns of a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks, played by Christoph Waltz.  Sam Mendes returns to direct SPECTRE, with Daniel Craig reprising his role as 007 for the fourth time. SPECTRE is produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli.  The screenplay is by John Logan and Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth, with a story by John Logan and Neal Purvis & Robert Wade.  About Albert R.

Cartoons is intended to bring promising talent and animated content to the attention of Sony Pictures Animation through an alternative development method.

At least one of those shorts will become a series for Frederator Network's Cartoon Hangover channel. Fred Seibert, CEO of Frederator Networks says, ""Sony Pictures Animation has been the perfect partner in finding these creators and realizing their unique visions.

Mr. Calley formerly served as chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment, which he joined in 1996 following successful terms as studio chief at Warner Bros. in the 1970s and MGM/United Artists in the 1990s. Known as much for his business acumen as his creative instincts, Mr. Calley was a low-key, erudite and respected executive whose relationships touched every corner of the industry. Mr. Calley remained active in the film and entertainment business until his death. He most recently produced the worldwide blockbuster hit The Da Vinci Code, among other recent projects.  Mr. Calley was honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in 2009 with the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award. At the time, the Academy recognized ""his intellectual rigor, sophisticated artistic sensibilities and calm, understated manner"" calling Mr. Calley ""one of the most trusted and admired figures in Hollywood."" ""John was unique. As a friend he was always there and always funny. He made life a joy for those he loved,"" said Mike Nichols. ""As a studio head he was unfailingly supportive and didn't try to do the filmmaker's job. When he believed in someone he trusted and supported him and when very rarely he had a suggestion it was usually a life saver. In fact that's what he was: a life saver."" ""The problem of making a comedy with John is that he was usually funnier than the actors,"" said Buck Henry. Said Sir Howard Stringer, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Sony Corporation, ""John Calley will be remembered in the history of Hollywood as an extraordinary studio chief, who ran three studios with a maximum of taste and a minimum of tyranny. Even today, the quality of his movies still have contemporary resonance. The Remains of the Day and A Clockwork Orange demonstrate vividly the twin contrasts of British society that together explained the riots. Catch-22 and The Americanization of Emily capture the unsettling ambivalence towards war you might expect from a former American soldier. Men In Black and Spider-Man revealed he could partner with a younger executive like Amy Pascal and discover a whole new audience. But John was more than a brilliant executive. I'm not sure he would even like that title. He was a wonderful raconteur, up there with Mike Nichols, Michael Caine and Peter Ustinov who could hold your attention for hours with rich anecdotes that capture the human dimensions of his beloved film industry; love's labors never lost as long as he was there to remember them. His sense of humor made us delighted when we shared his adventures, and envious when we did not. Even in his lengthy illness he never lost his charm or ever felt sorry for himself. Life without his friendship will be so much less joyous. His generosity of spirit made those of us lucky enough to work with him feel we had a loyal and unique companion for life. We did.""  ""John Calley was more than a mentor and boss he was the most extraordinary and generous friend,"" said Amy Pascal, Co-Chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. ""He had a steely business mind and the soul of an artist. His sense of humor about the business never made him cynical or got in the way of his passion for movies and directors. John's taste may have seemed idiosyncratic but his pulse was unerring. How could one person have championed All The President's Men, Blazing Saddles, The Exorcist, Dirty Harry, Klute, A Clockwork Orange at the exact right moment in time? Those are the instincts of a one-of-a-kind executive. He never pandered to the audience, he never accepted conventional studio wisdom and he never lost his enthusiasm. John was my guiding light. He taught me everything.""  ""John Calley was a genuine legend as an executive, producer and passionate lover of the art of filmmaking,"" said Michael Lynton, Chairman & CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment. ""We know the entire community shares in our deep sadness over his passing. He was an extraordinarily gifted man, whose grace, wit, sensitivity and intelligence were an inspiration to all of us and will be sorely missed. We will not see his like again.""  Mr. Calley was born on July 8, 1930, in Jersey City, N.J. He joined the entertainment industry at the age of 21, landing a job in the NBC mailroom in New York after serving in the U.S. Army. That job led to positions of increasing responsibility in sales, production and programming during the television network's formative years, with Mr. Calley eventually becoming director of nighttime programming. From there, Mr. Calley went on to become vice president of Henry Jaffe Enterprises, where he was responsible for developing and producing musical entertainment for films. He next moved to Ted Bates Advertising as vice president in charge of radio and television programming.  Mr. Calley later joined Filmways, where he produced such hits as Ice Station Zebra, Topkapi, The Cincinnati Kid, The Americanization of Emily, The Loved One and Catch-22, based on the Joseph Heller novel of wartime insanity. While working on Catch-22, Mr. Calley became identified with a seismic shift in Hollywood's balance of power. The late 1960s ushered in a new generation of younger filmmakers just as the major studios were discovering the vast potential of the youth market, largely due to the runaway success of Easy Rider. ""Kids were kings. After Easy Rider, everything was exploding everywhere,"" Mr. Calley recalled in a 1999 newspaper interview. ""We were all young, it was our time, and it was very exciting. The founders were no longer in charge... What had been this rigid, immobile structure had completely come apart, and what was left was a lot of freedom."" In 1969, Mr. Calley moved to Warner Bros., where he served as head of production, president and vice chairman. During his 13 years there with partners Frank Wells and Ted Ashley, Warner Bros. had a string of successful films. The studio's hits included The Exorcist, Dirty Harry, A Clockwork Orange, Deliverance, Towering Inferno, A Star Is Born, Blazing Saddles, What's Up Doc?, Jeremiah Johnson, Klute, All The President's Men, Superman, Barry Lyndon, Chariots of Fire and Woodstock. Throughout his career, he worked closely with top directors, from Stanley Kubrick (who for years was one of Mr. Calley's closest confidantes), to Clint Eastwood and Sydney Pollack to Federico Fellini, among many others. His friends included producer/director Mike Nichols, and actress Candice Bergen. While at Warner Bros., Mr. Calley was responsible for all of Mr. Kubrick's and Mr. Eastwood's films, including the latter's Dirty Harry and Western franchises. Mr. Calley also was responsible for films released under the First Artists, Orion and Ladd Company banners. In 1980, Mr. Calley took a hiatus from the film industry and moved to a home he owned on Fishers Island in Long Island Sound. For the next several years, he traveled extensively. In 1989, he became an independent film producer in partnership with Mr. Nichols. Together, they produced the critically acclaimed Postcards From The Edge and Remains Of The Day. In September 1993, Mr. Calley joined MGM/United Artists Pictures as president and chief operating officer. While there, he oversaw all facets of development and production for films produced and released under the United Artists banner. Mr. Calley helped revitalize the studio with such worldwide hits as Goldeneye, the highest-grossing film in the history of the James Bond franchise, and the smash comedy The Birdcage, the contemporary American version of La Cage Aux Folles. During his tenure at United Artists, Mr. Calley also shepherded the critically acclaimed Leaving Las Vegas, starring Academy Award®-winner Nicolas Cage, and Richard III, starring Sir Ian McKellan. After three years with MGM/United Artists Pictures, in October 1996, Mr. Calley left to join Sony Pictures Entertainment where he was named president and chief operating officer. He spent seven years with the studio, retiring in 2003 as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. During this time, he oversaw the production of such blockbusters as Spider-Man, As Good As It Gets, Men In Black, and Air Force One, among many others. Under his leadership, Sony's home entertainment and international television businesses experienced strong growth, and the domestic TV division had hit shows like The King of Queens and Dawson's Creek. Throughout his life, Mr. Calley was an avid sailing enthusiast and in his later years, spent much time enjoying his love of the sea on one of his boats. He was also an avid lover of classic and collectible automobiles. He was a philanthropist and was a proud member of the board of the American Film Institute (AFI), among many other professional and charitable affiliations.",Public
" THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13TH, 2014 - In a first of its kind partnership, Spider-Man will be the first Super Hero ambassador for Earth Hour, the global movement organized by WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), with a message to inspire individuals to use their power to become Super Heroes for the planet. Andy Ridley, CEO and Co-Founder of Earth Hour, and Jeff Blake, Chairman, Worldwide Marketing and Distribution, Sony Pictures Entertainment, made the announcement in conjunction with the launch of Earth Hour Blue - a radical new digital crowdfunding and crowdsourcing platform for the planet, launched to engage people around the world and participants in the famous lights out event, which this year will be held on Saturday March 29, at 8:30pm. This year, Earth Hour and the hero of the highly anticipated motion picture The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - along with the film's stars, Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx and director Marc Webb - are throwing their support behind Earth Hour Blue, which aims to harness the power of the crowd to raise funds for on-the-ground environmental projects from across the world. ""I'm proud Spider-Man is the first Super Hero ambassador for Earth Hour because he shows we can all be Super Heroes when we realize the power we all have,"" says Andrew Garfield, who plays Spider-Man in the upcoming film. ""Earth Hour is a movement that has created massive impact around the world, so imagine what we can do this year with Spider-Man by our side."" The crowdfunding section of the new platform will allow participants to help deliver energy efficient stoves to families in Madagascar, help communities in the Philippines build fiberglass boats to withstand climate impacts like Typhoon Haiyan and raise funds to expand and conserve the iconic Table Mountain National Park in South Africa, with many more projects to come. ""Earth Hour gives you the power to inspire anyone, even if you're just one person, and Earth Hour is much more than an hour. There are great projects from the crowd, for the planet, happening all over the world,"" said Emma Stone. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 director Marc Webb is the first celebrity ambassador to announce the Earth Hour Blue project he is backing, which aims to provide better equipment for WWF Rangers protecting Indonesia's endangered wildlife such as the Sumatran Tiger, Elephant, Rhino and Orangutan and their forest habitat. ""Earth Hour is a movement full of Super Heroes - people harnessing the power of the crowd to inspire change for the good of the planet, imagine the possibilities when we come together and do more,"" said Marc Webb. Earth Hour has grown to involve hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life across 7000 cities and towns and 154 countries and territories. Jamie Foxx who plays the villain Electro in the film said, ""Earth Hour isn't just about lights off; it's about people across the world coming together throughout the year to join forces to improve the planet. Never underestimate your power, never underestimate what you can do."" Individuals can also use Earth Hour's crowdsourcing platform for Earth Hour Blue, which will call for people to add their voice to some of the biggest environmental campaigns across the world; including an Instagram campaign for people to share their love of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, as part of WWF-Australia's ""Lights Out For The Reef"" theme for Earth Hour 2014. Global participants in the movement will also be able to sign the Shark Saver's ""I'm FINished With FINS"" pledge, which engages celebrities and public figures throughout Asia to help end shark finning in marine waters for the consumption of shark-fin soup. ""The idea of Earth Hour has grown beyond anything we could have dreamed. This year with the help of Spider-Man by our side, we are taking the movement to the next stage. We hope that Spider-Man will empower individuals to be Super Heroes for the planet, and use their voice or their dollar to support projects or campaigns around the world. It's about harnessing the power of the crowd. That's what Earth Hour Blue is all about,"" said Ridley. Sony Pictures Entertainment will join by contributing to a WWF-China and Earth Hour Blue project that provides efficient cookstoves to prevent deforestation in the habitat of the Giant Panda. Through its efforts, the studio will receive Gold Standard carbon offsets that render the entire physical production of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as well as its publicity tour, carbon-neutral. Expanding on many sustainability efforts over the years, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 became the most eco-friendly tentpole production in the history of Columbia Pictures. These environmental efforts, on set and off, were supported at every level - from producers, studio executives, and cast and crew and began as soon as the film went into pre-production. ""Spider-Man's always been a very relatable Super Hero. Peter Parker is a hero to all people, and an inspiration, so it seems very fitting that he should join forces with Earth Hour to empower every single individual to help save the planet,"" Blake added. ""I'm also very proud of the fact that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is entirely carbon-neutral. We made a commitment to be as eco-conscious as possible during production itself, when we took a special effort to think green and avoid waste; now, completing that process with Earth Hour Blue is a wonderful testament to what we can achieve when we all work together."" Earth Hour and its Super Hero ambassador Spider-Man remind us that ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" so get involved and use your power at earthhour.org.

About Earth Hour

ABOUT THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2
We've always known that Spider-Man's most important battle has been within himself: the struggle between the ordinary obligations of Peter Parker and the extraordinary responsibilities of Spider-Man. But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that a greater conflict lies ahead. It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: Oscorp. Directed by Marc Webb. Produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach. Screen Story and Screenplay by Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci & Jeff Pinkner. Based on the Marvel Comic Book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. The film will be released in theaters internationally beginning April 16, 2014, and in the U.S. on May 2, 2014. #SpiderMan ABOUT SONY PICTURES

" CULVER CITY, Calif., December 18, 2012 - In an exclusive interview for Sony Movie Channel (SMC), Sir Howard Stringer, Sony Corporation's Chairman of the Board, pays tribute to the life of Nora Ephron (SLEEPLESS  IN SEATTLE, HANGING UP), one of the most successful screenwriters, filmmakers and playwrights of this era. Sir Howard's interview, reflecting on Ephron's acclaimed career will air tonight, Tuesday, December 18 as part of SMC's special double-feature tribute to Ephron, presenting her first and last directing efforts, 1992's THIS IS MY LIFE (starring Julie Kavner) at 8:00 PM E/5:00 PM P and 2009's JULIE & JULIA (starring  Meryl Streep and Amy Adams) at 10:00 PM E/7:00 PM P. The interview is also available for online viewing until December 31 at SonyMovieChannel.com. “As part of Sony Movie Channel's commitment to extend its viewing experiences for its fans, we were able to interview Sir Howard Stringer, about his relationship with Nora Ephron for the Channel's  original series ‘Reel 6.' Devotees of Nora will greatly appreciate hearing, firsthand, Sir Howard's personal remembrance of this talented filmmaker who was a close colleague and friend,” said Andy Kaplan, president, worldwide networks, Sony Pictures Television. A prolific writer, essayist, journalist and humorist, Ephron died at the age of 71 on June 26, 2012. She was beloved by the Industry - on both coasts - and had many admirers including Sir Howard, who first met Ephron during a party in Greenwich Village. In his “Reel 6”  interview, Sir Howard shares his personal memories about Ephron, revealing how they met and how JULIE & JULIA became a reality. Sir Howard's interview is very much in the same tone as the writing that Ephron was known for - it's a love letter from one good friend to another as evidenced by these excerpts below. On her unique ability to connect with people, Sir Howard said: “There was room for everybody in Nora's life. To this day, I don't know how she found the stamina for it. But that's a really remarkable thing about Nora and this is why she creates a vacuum that can never be filled. I cannot think of somebody who could replace her. As a movie director - fine; as a  career - fine. But as a friend, and as a collaborator, and as a companion, and as a very special unique human being; she's irreplaceable.” He had this to say about her trade: “Directing comedy is a rare skill, and for Nora it was her métier, I think. There's no question she was an inspiration to those that were hoping to be directors and some of those who were directors. But for Nora, the sensibilities were so profoundly perfect for that medium that it's not surprising to me that it is hard to follow. The three great comedies, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and YOU'VE GOT MAIL, all have a peculiar Nora atmosphere. As far as I'm concerned, she owned the romantic comedy for longer than most directors ever do.” Ephron's career in film blossomed with such motion pictures as SILKWOOD and WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, both of which garnered Oscar® nominations for her. With a stable of celebrated works under  her belt, Ephron soon turned to directing. She made her directorial debut with the 1992 drama THIS IS MY LIFE. THIS IS  MY LIFE tells the story of Dottie Engels (Julie Kavner), a single mother who aspires to be a stand-up comedian. Although she succeeds, her quest for fame negatively affects her daughters (Samantha Mathis and Gaby Hoffmann), who are left alone to their own devices as she travels on the road. Ephron, who admits to being obsessed with food, was able to feature her passion in JULIE & JULIA, recreating some of Julia Child's most famous entrees from her iconic cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking. The book plays a key role in the plot, as food blogger Julie Powell (Amy Adams) attempts to cook each of Child's (Meryl Streep) recipes, while chronicling her progress over the course of a year.  To showcase JULIE & JULIA even further, SMC has created a comprehensive tablet-friendly application, THE JULIE & JULIA APP, now available to Facebook users through December 31. The immersive app, featuring multimedia content such as an interactive recipe guide and movie trivia, has been set up as a stand-alone tab  on SMC's Facebook page at facebook.com/sonymoviechannel. And to further connect with passionate film enthusiasts, SMC is offering a limited edition JULIE & JULIA sticker to all fans that check-in to the channel on GetGlue.com. The sticker will be available from December 5 until  December 31.  Sir Howard's interview is a part of SMC's “Reel 6” originals - a program devised of TV and web shorts featuring behind-the-scenes interviews with filmmakers who provide their own unique take to a respective movie or theme airing on the network. In addition to Sir Howard, other “Reel 6”  interviews have included A KNIGHT'S TALE director Brian Helgeland who discussed casting Heath Ledger, and SILVERADO executive producer Michael Grillo, who spoke about the difficulties of location scouting for a western.

" CULVER CITY, CA (May 8, 2013) - To pay tribute to the legendary Ray Harryhausen's remarkable achievements, Sony Movie Channel has revised its schedule to include a special TV marathon, on Saturday, May 11, highlighting the filmmaker's career. Harryhausen, who died yesterday at the age of 92, is renowned for his special effects innovations and as the inventor of stop motion animation. On Saturday, May 11, Sony Movie Channel will be airing the definitive Ray Harryhausen documentary, RAY HARRYHAUSEN: SPECIAL EFFECTS TITAN, at 12:45 p.m. ET/9:45 a.m. PT. Following the documentary, Harryhausen fans will enjoy watching three SINBAD-focused films featuring Harryhausen's special effects animation from Sony Pictures Entertainment's library - THE 7TH VOYAGE OF SINBAD (airs at 2:30 p.m. ET/11:30 a.m. PT); THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD (airs at 4:10 p.m. ET/1:10 PM PT) and SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER (airs at 6:10 p.m. ET/3:10 p.m. PT). Additionally, SMC is recognizing Harryhausen's award-winning career online, presenting an interactive web experience that features Harryhausen's signature creatures, as well as specially produced content honoring him and his impressive body of work. That web experience can be found at SonyMovieChannel.com/ray. For those who are SMC subscribers, they will be able to watch the documentary online through May 31 by accessing that same web page. Last month, Sony Movie Channel premiered the RAY HARRYHAUSEN: SPECIAL EFFECTS TITAN documentary on television for the first time in the U.S. The documentary, produced in 2011 by Frenetic Arts, in Paris, marks the first time that the Ray and Diana Harryhausen Foundation has provided unprecedented access to all aspects of his award-winning career, spanning his early days in Hollywood, to his 90th birthday celebration. RAY HARRYHAUSEN: SPECIAL EFFECTS TITAN was filmed over a 10-year period and features interviews and tributes from an illustrious list of acclaimed filmmakers who were inspired by his work. Directed by Gilles Penso, the documentary includes interviews with longtime admirers and Harryhausen fans that have been involved in some of the film industry's biggest blockbuster hits. With 16 movies to his credit, Harryhausen is known for pioneering numerous new techniques during his acclaimed filmmaking career. Not only was he a leader in armatured models and miniatures, but he also created a new type of stop-motion split-screen animation, known as ""Dynamation."" His special effects budget for THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS (1952) called for a more practical way of model interaction and, as such, Harryhausen developed a simple but effective method involving split-screens and a projector - hence, ""Dynamation"" was born. In addition to innovating new filming practices, Harryhausen is credited with creating the physical looks and movements of dinosaurs, alien figures and creatures in motion pictures. Many producers and directors today still base their prehistoric creatures and beasts, as well as alien objects like flying saucers and visitors from other planets, on Harryhausen's characters, models and drawings. His influence in genre filmmaking is still very prevalent today - over five decades later. Sony Movie Channel is on Channel 563 on DIRECTV; Channel 386 on DISH and Channel 1791 on AT&T U-Verse.

" Culver City, CA, November 3, 2014  - Sony Pictures Animation today announced it would partner with animation pacesetter Fred Seibert to forge GO! Cartoons, a new idea incubator project that will provide emerging artists an incredible opportunity:  a chance to turn their ideas into animated shorts that will debut on Seibert's Cartoon Hangover YouTube channel, with its more than 1.3 million subscribers.  Sony Pictures Animation will fund 12 five-minute animated shorts, with one premiering every month on Cartoon Hangover's YouTube channel.  One of those shorts will then become a limited series for the channel.  This, in turn, will bring promising talent and animated content to the attention of Sony Pictures Animation through an alternative development method.  Bob Osher, President of Sony Pictures Digital Productions, states, ""Fred Seibert is a force of nature in animation, and we are thrilled to expand our current relationship with him by partnering on this.  This is a great opportunity for Sony Pictures Animation to find new talent that might not emerge from more traditional platforms. Fred has a proven track record with this type of incubator project, with series after series launched from them, including The Powerpuff Girls, The Fairly OddParents and Adventure Time.  Hotel Transylvania director Genndy Tartakovsky was also an incubator find—Fred and I were in the first meeting where he pitched the idea for the hit series Dexter's Laboratory."" Fred Seibert—whose boundless creativity has given rise to multiple networks like MTV, pioneered the reinvention of TV animation and helped establish tumblr—explains, ""We've discovered amazing young talent through these unique incubators, and for the artists, this is an easier way to be seen.  For Sony Pictures Animation, it provides different methods to develop projects.  And for Cartoon Hangover, it's a great way to shake the trees for new talent thanks to the involvement of a major animation studio like Sony Pictures Animation—and we'll continue to fund and produce content our own unique way."" Seibert and his team at Frederator Studios, his independent animation studio, have successfully expanded the appeal of new animation beyond the expected demographics.  Cartoon Hangover's most recent incubator lab, Too Cool! Cartoons, has brought ""cartoons from new and innovative creators all over the world, right to your eyeballs,"" including Bee & PuppyCat, from Natasha Allegri—which garnered more than 4 million views, with 50% female viewers.  Frederator Studios went directly to viewers via Kickstarter, and more than 18,000 fans ponied up in excess of $850,000 to bankroll the series, a record-breaking amount for any animation project start-up. Sony Pictures Animation is the Academy Award® nominated studio responsible for blockbuster comedy hits such as Open Season, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Hotel Transylvania, and The Smurfs.

" 
LAS VEGAS, NV, March 15, 2010  -  The nation's theater owners were asked today by the head of a major Hollywood studio to have healthier snacks at their concession stands in addition to their traditional offerings of candy, popcorn and soda. 
In a speech at ShoWest, the nation's largest convention for the movie theater industry, Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman and CEO Michael Lynton said, ""adding healthier options to your existing menu is the right thing to do for our industry, for audiences and for our country."" 
Lynton said a poll of moviegoers commissioned by Sony Pictures revealed: 
Lynton said he was not asking theaters to stop selling popcorn, soda and candy.  ""Audiences love them"" he said.  ""I'm just talking about adding some healthier items to what you already sell."" 
Lynton also announced that the Alliance for a Healthier Generation has offered to meet with the theater owners ""and offer advice on how to change your menus in a way that makes sense for your audiences and your business."" 
""The private sector, including the theatre industry, has the ability to improve the access families have to healthier foods and beverages,"" said President Bill Clinton, founder of the William J. Clinton Foundation, who co-leads the Alliance for a Healthier Generation with Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and American Heart Association President Clyde Yancy.  ""The Alliance brokered voluntary agreements with the beverage industry that resulted in an 88 percent decrease in beverage calories shipped to America's schools in just a few years. We are eager to work with the movie theater industry to craft similar agreements to provide healthy concession options in movie theaters."" 
""In order to turn the tide on the obesity epidemic we are going to need to make soup to nuts changes in the number of calories we take in and the calories we actively use. Because kids are eating and foraging at home, school, sporting events and at the movies, changes are needed everywhere,"" said Dr. Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics, public health and public policy at UCLA and director of the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities. ""We can't expect kids to make healthy choices if they aren't given healthy choices to make. And while this is a nationwide problem, and will require support from companies with a national stature like Sony Pictures and large theater chains, it will also depend on the ingenuity and commitment of local theater operators to make the difference in their communities."" 
In a videotaped message to the convention, Dr. Mehmet Oz, vice chair and professor of surgery at Columbia University and host of The Dr. Oz Show, said, ""Everyone enjoys popcorn and a soda at the movies, but there are healthier alternatives. Good nutrition doesn't mean eating spinach at every meal. But with so many children and teens going to movies so often these days, I think we've got to be mindful about what they're eating and drinking, and giving them the chance to choose healthier food makes a lot of sense."" 
Lynton said theater owners should consider taking this step because childhood obesity is an epidemic, it's the responsible thing to do for audiences and society, and it's good for their business because it would help families enjoy theaters even more and, by giving them healthier options, more snacks will be purchased. 
Regarding what kinds of snacks might be offered at theaters, Lynton said, ""I don't think giant tubs of spinach or broccoli's a good idea.  And nobody wants to eat cauliflower while watching Spider-Man, or drink a 40-ounce cup of prune juice."" 
He said moviegoers suggested to the studio's interviewers the kind of snacks they'd like to see: 
Lynton said some people sneak healthy snacks into movie theaters, like a granola bar or a box of raisins, which represents an untapped market for concession stands.  ""People are consuming food differently these days.  In fact, many of your theaters are located near Starbucks and Whole Foods and in malls and other places where consumers are now finding more nutritious food and beverage options.  Audiences would love both a great theatrical experience and terrific snacks.""		 
Lynton said employees at Sony Pictures are offered a subsidized healthy lunch special and expanded salad bar at the studio commissary.  He noted some theaters are moving in the direction of offering healthier foods; some use canola oil instead of coconut oil for their popcorn.  He also said he understands that some things ""will prove to be logistically or economically impossible...But even small steps in the right direction can have a big impact.""

" CULVER CITY, Calif., (September 7, 2011) - Sony Pictures Television's (SPT) networks have acquired the original multi-platform series The Confession for their international channels and branded non-linear platforms. Starring multi award-winning actor Kiefer Sutherland and two-time Academy Award nominee John Hurt, The Confession will premiere on SPT's AXN-branded platforms in 125 territories and on AXN.com beginning in September. The announcement was made by Marie Jacobson, executive vice president, programming and production, networks, SPT. AXN Korea will debut the digital series first on September 12th followed by a targeted online roll out across AXN Central Europe's 10 localized websites on September 20th with subsequent territory roll outs including Spain, Portugal, Latin America, Hong Kong, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan. The series consists of 10 original episodes, 4 scripted back-story episodes and extensive behind-the-scenes footage. In total, almost 2 hours of original content will be available in varying formats across the channels and on AXN.com in every region. SPT will handle additional distribution of the show worldwide and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment will handle digital and DVD distribution exclusively, outside of North America. ""The Confession is one of the highest-quality multi-platform series we've seen in our many years developing and buying content for our TV and digital platforms,"" said Jacobson. ""The series will play great alongside AXN's biggest primetime shows and Kiefer is a killer draw for our global audience."" The Confession is a unique story of redemption and the exploration of good and evil. The story begins on Christmas Eve when a hitman (Kiefer Sutherland) enters a church to confess his sins to a priest (John Hurt). Through a series of gripping flashbacks, the Confessor's story is revealed. The audience is taken on a dramatic journey leading to the moment where one man's chance at ultimate redemption hangs in the balance.  While at first the Confessor appears to be an evil, cold-blooded killing machine and the Priest the ultimate arbiter of good, both characters push the boundaries of right and wrong. Produced by Digital Broadcasting Group, The Confession is written and directed by Brad Mirman. Kiefer Sutherland, Chris Young, Joseph Gomes and Maura Mandt serve as executive producers.

Kristine Belson, President of Sony Pictures Animation, says, ""We are meaningfully stepping up our level of production, while creating an environment that fosters the best talent. Our goal is to enlarge our presence in the animation landscape with a uniquely diverse slate, and our strategy to get there is to let artists drive the movies creatively."" Tom Rothman, Chairman of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, adds, ""I could not be more proud of the way Kristine Belson has rebuilt Sony Pictures Animation into the boldest home for animation in the industry."" Sony Pictures Animation's slate includes a diverse mix of originals and franchises, some previously announced, each with its own unique style and tone, underscoring the Studio's pledge to develop projects aimed both inside and outside of the Sony Pictures Animation family brand intended for traditional, as well as online, distribution platforms.

Director Genndy Tartakovsky (DEXTER'S LABORATORY, STAR WARS: CLONE WARS), who returns to helm this brand new adventure, says, ""I thought I was done exploring the world of HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA after the first two films, but while I was away from the franchise finishing my TV show SAMURAI JACK, an idea sparked that I got really excited about and made it irresistible to return and helm myself this third adventure.""

Commenting on the announcement Belgrad said, ""Hasbro has already seen tremendous success with Transformers and G.I. Joe and audiences have shown a great desire for films that bring to life everything that has made these franchise properties stand the test of time.  The strategic thinking and the tactical gambles that players must take in the game are what make RISK a classic, thoroughly engaging game.  Those elements translated into an action-packed, thrilling story are what will make this a uniquely exciting movie.""
		 
Lassiter added ""We are excited to be working with Hasbro and Columbia Pictures on bringing such a beloved and well-known game to life on the big screen. We have two television projects currently in development with Hasbro Studios and look forward to this collaboration.""

According to Hasbro, RISK was a groundbreaking game, the first board game to offer nonlinear movement.  In the game, players compete on a map of the world, amassing armies and attempting world domination, or, as its rules put it, to ""occupy every territory on the board and in so doing, eliminate all other players.""

The film was just announced as part of the 2014 Cannes Film Festival lineup in the Special Screening Section. RED ARMY is about the Soviet Union and the most successful dynasty in sports history:   the Red Army hockey team.  Filmmaker Gabe Polsky tells an extraordinary human story from the perspective of its captain Slava Fetisov, the friendships, the betrayals, and the personal dramas, which led to his transformation from national hero to political enemy.

""At its heart, this is a film about the Russian soul,"" stated Polsky. ""I'm thrilled for the opportunity to work with Tom and Michael and very excited to present the film in Cannes."" ""We can't wait to present this film to audiences everywhere. This is Russian history as seen from the perspective of professional ice hockey,"" said Bernard and Barker.

"  NEW YORK (September 21, 2017) - Sony Pictures Classics announced today that they have acquired all rights in North America, Latin America and Scandanavia to Samuel Maoz's FOXTROT.  The film is the official Oscar submission from Israel and has screened at the Venice, Telluride and Toronto Film Festivals to rave reviews.  It won the Grand Jury prize at Venice, as well as eight Ophir Awards including Best Film, Best Director and Best Actor.   With biting humor and social satire, FOXTROT dances with fate.  An Israeli couple opens their door, only to see army officials on their doorstep who tell them their soldier son has been killed. Much of the film deals with the young soldier as he mans an isolated checkpoint. Having worked together previously on LEBANON, FOXTROT marks the second film between Maoz and Sony Pictures Classics. The Match Factory and Sony Pictures Classics have partnered together on a number of films including THE LUNCHBOX, WALTZ WITH BASHIR and most recently TONI ERDMANN.    ""FOXTROT is a rare, fresh, suspenseful and important movie.  Once you've experienced all of its surprises, you will never be the same. It is great to be in business with Samuel, Eitan Mansuri, and Michael Weber from The Match Factory once again,"" said Sony Pictures Classics.  Said Samuel Maoz, ""It was a huge compliment when Sony Pictures Classics took my first film LEBANON and now I'm proud and glad they did it again. I think it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""  ""The rhythm has changed, in 2009 it was the Waltz (with Bashir), this time its the Foxtrot, I'm delighted about dancing with my friends at Sony Pictures Classics again,"" stated Michael Weber.    ""We are happy and excited to go in the Oscar journey together with Sony Pictures Classics, it's the best fit for our film,"" added Eitan Mansuri.

" NEW YORK (February 10, 2019) – Sony Pictures Classics announced today that they have acquired all rights worldwide to the John Prine documentary tentatively titled JOHN PRINE: HELLO IN THERE. Currently in post-production, JOHN PRINE: HELLO IN THERE tells the story of the iconic singer/songwriter who has notoriously been very mysterious to much of the public. Prine broke through with an album he wrote as a mailman in the Chicago suburbs, and went on to create some of the strangest, funniest, most surreal and most enduring songs of our time including ""Angel from Montgomery."" The movie began filming John as he prepared to release his first album of new songs in 13 years, and follows him throughout a remarkable resurgence that has taken him from Radio City Music Hall to the Songwriters Hall of Fame. With the complete support of the Prine family, the filmmakers conducted extensive interviews with Prine’s friends and peers; including young songwriters he helped shape, such as Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell and Margo Price. The film was co-written by Zachary Fuhrer and Patrick Doyle, produced by Doyle and directed by Fuhrer. RadicalMedia is a production partner on the film. Said Sony Pictures Classics, ""Zachary Fuhrer and Patrick Doyle are beautifully capturing the story of one of the world's most original musicians. We are thrilled to give fans the opportunity to discover John Prine more intimately through this remarkable film."" Said Patrick Doyle, ""Spending time with John Prine over the last year, we’ve learned that he is just as insightful — and hilarious — in everyday life as he is in his songs. From playing at pubs in western Ireland to the Ryman Auditorium, there is nobody better at spellbinding a room. For the last 50 years, he's been a voice for the overworked, underpaid and forgotten, and our current political times have made his songs even more relevant. He is a Johnny Cash-level talent we are lucky to still have performing, and he was kind enough to let us in on his life: making breakfast at home in Nashville, preparing for the biggest show of his life at Radio City and more. Zach and I couldn’t be happier to work with Tom Bernard, Michael Barker and the Sony Pictures Classics team on what we want to be the definitive portrait of an American songwriting legend."" Added Zachary Fuhrer, ""Patrick and I can’t think of a better partner than Sony Pictures Classics for our film. As John’s band members like to say, 'There are two types of people: those who love John Prine and those who haven’t heard of him yet.' John’s philosophy on life — finding comedy in tragedy — is the heart of the film; his stories a daily reminder that there’s always a way to laugh at your own misfortune. None of this would be possible without the endless support of John, Fiona, Jody and the Prine family, a crew of dear friends, Peter Shapiro, and the team at Radical."" A theatrical release is planned The deal was negotiated directly between the filmmakers and SPC. The filmmakers are represented by Bianca Grimshaw of Gray Krauss Sandler Des Rochers LLP.

" BUDAPEST (June 11, 2012) - Sony Pictures Television (SPT) is launching a scripted series format developed specifically for Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), with plans to unveil it at NATPE Budapest this month. The EIGHTIES, a coming of age dramedy set in the time of Perestroika, was developed and produced by SPT Productions Russia and LEAN-M for the CTC network earlier this year. In Russia, The EIGHTIES was a ratings powerhouse, the highest rated series of the year for CTC, beating the channel's prime time average rating for 16-34 year olds by 81%. CTC has also ordered a second series for broadcast later this year. The EIGHTIES, set in Moscow in 1986, follows a group of college students coming into adulthood, just as the Soviet Union itself faced dramatic and sweeping changes. Freedom was most definitely in the air! For the first time, the youth of the nation could look to the West as a benchmark for the future. Eighteen year old Vanya and his friends tasted opportunity where once there was only restriction - and as the country grew up around them, so too did their hopes and dreams that life has more to offer than a factory job paying 120 roubles and endless evenings listening to forbidden songs in secret. Life, it seems, is full of love, of heartbreak, of friends and adventures that echo through time. Jeff Lerner, svp scripted development, international production, SPT, said: ""The EIGHTIES is set at the start of a dramatic period of change in history - politically, culturally and socially. This backdrop of a country experiencing so many 'firsts' provides a poignant parallel to our characters' lives as they experience the ups and downs of student life, romance, parties, friendship and family. The juxtaposition of these rites of passage, alongside the country's coming of age, allows for a shared experience that many CEE broadcasters will recognise as particularly resonant for their audiences."" SPT will also present non-scripted formats to buyers at NATPE Budapest, in particular its gameshow, Breakaway (from Gogglebox Entertainment), which has just been commissioned for a second series by the BBC, and its cross-generational music series, Cover Me (from Tuvalu Media) already licensed in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland and Portugal. Other major formats recently licensed by SPT across CEE include gameshow Who Wants to be a Millionaire? in territories such as Russia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Poland and Albania; talkshow, The Dr Oz Show, in Russia and Armenia; and sitcoms Everybody Loves Raymond and King of Queens in Russia, and Rules of Engagement in Poland.

" NEW YORK (September 11, 2014) - Sony Pictures Classics announced today that they acquired North American rights to Giulio Ricciarelli's directorial debut LABRYRINTH OF LIES from sales agent Beta Cinema.  The film, based on a true story, exposes the conspiracy of certain prominent institutions and government branches to cover up the crimes of Nazis during WWII. LABYRINTH OF LIES will have its world premiere on Friday at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.  The film is produced by Claussen + Wöbke + Putz Filmproduktion in co-production with Naked Eye Film Production and stars Alexander Fehling (INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, YOUNG GOETHE IN LOVE), André Szymanski, Johann von Bülow and Friederike Becht (THE READER, YOUNG GOETHE IN LOVE) and Gert Voss. In LABYRINTH OF LIES the economic miracle is changing the life of Germans in post-war Germany 20 years later. Most of them are sick of the war and prefer to push their guilt to the back of their mind. When a journalist (André Szymanski) identifies a teacher in the playground as a former guard from Auschwitz, no one wants to take notice. But a young prosecutor (Alexander Fehling) takes on the case and can‘t even be stopped by his boss. During his research he realizes that some Germans claim that they never heard the expression “Auschwitz,“ while others try to forget about it. As the resolute prosecutor doesn‘t give up, the Attorney General Fritz Bauer (Gert Voss) retains him to take charge of the investigations. Struggling with an overload of information, the young attorney blunders into a labyrinth of guilt and lies where he almost gets lost. ""Of all the films available for acquisition at the Toronto International Film Festival, LABYRINTH OF LIES is the gem under the rock. A riveting, true story about witnesses to atrocities during WWII Germany and the aftermath in post war Germany in the 20 years that followed. This is a great movie and the birth of a major new European filmmaker. We are so happy to be once again in business with Beta Cinema, a company that continues to provide us the very best films (LIVES OF OTHERS, THE COUNTERFEITERS) out there. We look forward to presenting Labyrinth of Lies to the American audience,"" stated Sony Pictures Classics. Director/Co-Writer Giulio Ricciarelli added, ""Having SPC as partner in the US is a dream coming true. I feel that SPC has love and respect for European movies and the skills to sell it to the American audience.""

We feel in very good hands and it is great to see Michael, Tom, Dylan and the whole team, believing so strongly in this film, ""stated Beta Cinema's Managing Director Dirk Schuerhoff, who negotiated the deal for the film.

The film, which played as the 2014 Sundance Film Festival's opening night film, received rave reviews on Thursday. Written by Chazelle, WHIPLASH stars Miles Teller (THE SPECTACULAR NOW) and J.K. Simmons (Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN trilogy). A scene from the original feature script WHIPLASH was shot as a proof of concept for the feature, and screened at last year's Sundance under the same title. It was awarded the Short Film Jury Prize for U.S. Fiction. WHIPLASH is financed by Bold Films which produced with Blumhouse and Right of Way. It is produced by Jason Blum of Blumhouse Productions, Helen Estabrook of Right of Way Films, and Michel Litvak and David Lancaster of Bold Films. The executive producers are Jason Reitman of Right of Way Films, Gary Michael Walters of Bold Films, and Couper Samuelson and Jeanette Brill of Blumhouse Productions. In WHIPLASH, Andrew Neyman is an ambitious young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory.  Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man's life.  Andrew's passion to achieve perfection quickly spirals into obsession, as his ruthless teacher continues to push him to the brink of both his ability—and his sanity.

Their passion and plan for this film felt like the perfect way to bring it to the world,"" says Chazelle, ""It's been an amazing ride so far with an amazing group of producers and I could not be more thrilled."" Sony Pictures Classics stated, ""What a way to begin Sundance! It's not just a good movie, it's a full, rich experience, a feast for our eyes, ears, and mind.

We are so pleased to be in partnership with Mike and his producers with a story that promises to be his best film ever"" says Sony Pictures Classics.

There are few titles out there that bring this kind of excitement, brand awareness and built-in audience to the table. We're thrilled to be distributing this film and we hope this is just the beginning of what will be a long relationship with Rovio as we look for ways to work on future projects together."" David Maisel and John Cohen said, ""We are very excited to join with Sony Pictures in presenting this movie to the world in 2016 and we will have many more announcements as we begin production in the coming months."" Angry Birds is one of the world's biggest entertainment franchises, starting in 2009 with the original mobile game that remains the number one paid app of all time. Angry Birds has expanded rapidly into entertainment, publishing, and licensing to become a beloved international brand. Angry Birds has been praised for its great value and simple, casual gameplay. Players use a slingshot to launch birds at green pigs in an attempt to get their eggs back, with the game setting the model for what is possible in terms of game development and commercial success. To date, the Angry Birds and Bad Piggies games have been downloaded more than 1.7 billion times across platforms and versions. The upcoming movie marks Rovio Entertainment's first foray into feature films, although fans have already been introduced to the Angry Birds world with the weekly Angry Birds Toons animated series. Rovio launched the series in March through its Angry Birds apps as well as on select video-on-demand channel providers, Smart TVs, connected devices, and on select TV networks around the world. Paving the way for a full-length feature film, Angry Birds Toons has been a massive success for Rovio clocking in over 150 million views from the Angry Birds apps alone within the first six weeks. While known for distributing world renowned motion picture franchises such as Spider-Man, Sony Pictures has been building a strong reputation in contemporary animation through its house production unit, Sony Pictures Animation, and hit films including Hotel Transylvania, The Smurfs, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Surf's Up, Open Season, and Aardman's Arthur Christmas and The Pirates!

" NEW YORK(November 7, 2013) - Sony Pictures Classics announced today that they have acquired US, German and Scandinavian rights to Paul Haggis' THIRD PERSON. Written and directed by Haggis, the film had its world premiere at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival and features an all-star cast including Academy Award®-nominee Liam Neeson, Academy Award®-winner Kim Basinger, Academy Award®-winner Adrien Brody, Academy Award®-nominee James Franco, Olivia Wilde, Mila Kunis, and Maria Bello. Michael Nozik of Hwy61 and Haggis produced the film along with Paul Breuls of Corsan, who also provided the financing. THIRD PERSON wends its way through three cities and three tales. The various stories, situated in Paris, Rome, and New York, are, at first glance, all separate, but Haggis effortlessly makes connections among them as the film unwinds, concentrating on three men and their romantic entanglements. Gradually, each one of these stories unveils its secrets, testifying to the whims and complexities of life. Surfaces are deceptive in the Haggis universe, but as each story is explored we discover untold pleasures and pains. Life is never easy: it can be deceptive, inhabited by anger and jealousy, but it can also be surprisingly joyous. ""The opportunity to work with the master himself - Paul Haggis - on creating an intelligent and intriguing relationship movie was an exceptional and fulfilling challenge for me.  To see how this group of brilliant actors interpret the characters from the film, was an experience that far exceeded my expectations.  I am thrilled to have Sony Pictures Classics as a partner and look forward to the continuation of a search for excellence, and the opportunity to work with the best in the business,"" said Paul Breuls. ""Michael and Tom have great instincts and all the right experience releasing smart, challenging films -- I'm thrilled Third Person found a home at Sony Pictures Classics,"" added Haggis. Sony Pictures Classics added, ""Paul Haggis is one of our great movie storytellers and Third Person is one of his best works featuring an exceptional cast led by Liam Neeson (also at his best). We are excited to bring Third Person to American audiences."" Sony Pictures Classics, CAA and Paradigm negotiated the deal.

The film will be produced by James Lassiter, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Will Smith through their Overbrook Entertainment banner, and by Shawn ""JAY Z"" Carter, Jay Brown, and Tyran ""Ty Ty"" Smith through Marcy Media.

Commenting on the announcement, Belgrad and Minghella said, ""After seeing firsthand his work on several films for Sony, including Easy A and Friends with Benefits, we're huge fans of Will Gluck.  At the helm of Annie, he will bring to this film all the charm of the original Broadway production while also appealing to a new generation."" JAY Z, who previously sampled the classic Annie song ""It's the Hard Knock Life"" in his chart-busting single ""Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem),"" stated, ""For Marcy Media's first foray into film, we couldn't ask for better partners and mentors than Overbrook Entertainment. We are excited to work with Will Gluck and Sony Pictures Entertainment.

Says Overbrook's Miguel Melendez, ""Willow was nine years old when we started developing this project, and has since grown out of the role.""  Overbrook and Sony will soon begin casting the role of Annie.

""'Pompeii' is a thrilling read and will make for an exciting miniseries,"" said Helen Verno, executive vice president, movies and miniseries, SPT.  ""Provocative and suspenseful, the story unfolds as both a love story and a thriller, with the historical, apocalyptic backdrop of a city on the precipice of destruction and characters who are totally relatable to a contemporary audience.""  
""We're looking forward to partnering again with Sony Pictures Television and Scott Free and with Executive Producer Judith Verno at the producing helm, we have a team that understands exciting event programming,"" said Rola Bauer, Partner and Managing Director of Tandem Communications. ""Pompeii was one of the worst natural disasters in our history and Mount Vesuvius is still considered to be one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. Even today, it remains a concern, with its ever-present potential for disaster."" 
""We're looking forward to partnering again with Sony Pictures Television and Scott Free and with Executive Producer Judith Verno at the producing helm, we have a team that understands exciting event programming,"" said Rola Bauer, Partner and Managing Director of Tandem Communications. ""Pompeii was one of the worst natural disasters in our history, and still captures our imagination in present day.""  
""The creation of worlds - specifically those historical worlds which continue to capture the popular imagination - is what we love to do and do best.  Pompeii is a strong and compelling character drama set against a backdrop of a flourishing but ultimately doomed civilization - exactly what makes great event television,"" said Ridley Scott. 
International bestselling and award-winning author Robert Harris (Fatherland, The Ghost) has created a suspenseful blazing thriller about one of the great natural disasters in human history.   When the mighty Aqua Augusta, the aqueduct-lifeline of the ancient cities of the Bay of Naples, suddenly starts to go dry, the newly assigned aqueduct engineer Marcus Attilius finds himself racing against time to keep the military and trade ports on the Bay alive. The young engineer doesn't realize that he's also in a race he can't win against one of the deadliest forces of nature - the inconceivable power building under the quiet slopes of Mount Vesuvius. 
Against the background of the final seventy-two hours before the catastrophic eruption of Vesuvius, and driven by a desperate search for answers, Attilius struggles - along with Corelia, his new young love - to survive the catastrophic experience which for generations to come will be summed up by one word: Pompeii. 
Called ""A supremely good piece of storytelling..."" by The Guardian, Harris' book has been translated into more than 30 languages.

" CANNES, FRANCE (May  22, 2012) - Sony Pictures Classics has acquired all North American rights to Pablo Larraín's Cannes Directors' Fortnight sensation, NO from financier Participant Media in association with Funny Balloons and Fabula. NO stars Gael García Bernal (Babel, The Motorcycle Diaries), Alfredo Castro, Antónia Zegers, Marcial Tagle, Néstor Cantillana, Jaime Vadell and Pascal Montero. The film is one of the best received films in Cannes with raves from critics following the first screening in Director's Fortnight. Directed by Pablo Larraín (Post Mortem, Tony Manero) from a screenplay by Pedro Peirano (The Maid), NO is produced by Juan de Diós Larraín and Daniel Dreifuss and executive produced by Participant's Jeff Skoll and Jonathan King. Based on a true story, when Chilean military dictator Augusto Pinochet, facing international pressure, calls for a referendum on his presidency in 1988, opposition leaders persuade a brash young advertising executive, Rene Saavedra (Gael García Bernal), to spearhead their campaign. With scant resources and constant scrutiny by the despot's watchmen, Saavedra and his team devise an audacious plan to win the election and free their country from oppression. ""This movie is a masterfully engaging and energetic drama about politics and power, a tonic for the brain that is also a major entertainment. NO establishes Pablo Larraín as a major international director and Gael García Bernal gives his finest performance. We are also delighted to be back in business with our friends at Participant,"" stated Sony Pictures Classics.

" (July 14, 2015 - Toronto, Canada) Corus Entertainment's Nelvana, one of the world's leading international producers and distributors of children's animated content, today announced that it is developing an exciting new animated TV series based on the blockbuster feature film, Hotel Transylvania from Sony Pictures Animation. Nelvana and Sony Pictures Animation will partner to bring the hit feature film to the small screen. Focusing on the teenage years of Dracula's daughter Mavis and her friends in brand new adventures, the animated monster comedy television series will be developed and produced by Nelvana Studio in Toronto and is slated to launch on air in early 2017. ""We're excited to be entering into a new relationship with Sony Pictures Animation to extend the world of Hotel Transylvania into a new TV series,” said Colin Bohm, Vice President, Head of Corus Kids. “The hilarious characters and clever premise of Hotel Transylvania set the stage for endless story possibilities."" Kristine Belson, President of Sony Pictures Animation commented: ""Audiences have embraced the world and characters of Hotel Transylvania, so we are thrilled to be partnering with Nelvana to take them on new adventures, expanding on the teenage years of Mavis and her friends at the world-famous monster five star resort!"" Rick Mischel, executive producer at Sony Pictures Animation added, ""Corus Entertainment's Nelvana is a perfect creative partner and we look forward to sharing more Hotel Transylvania monster laughs with fans of all ages."" The theatrical release of Hotel Transylvania, which premiered in Fall 2012, set a record as the highest-grossing September opening ever at the U.S. box office. The film introduced Hotel Transylvania, Dracula's lavish five-stake resort, where monsters and their families can live it up, free to be the monsters they are without humans to bother them. On one special weekend, Dracula has invited some of the world's most famous monsters — Frankenstein and his wife, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, a family of werewolves, and more — to celebrate his beloved daughter Mavis' 118th birthday. For Drac, catering to all of these legendary monsters is no problem, but his world could come crashing down when a human stumbles on the hotel for the first time and takes a shine to Mavis. Drac's pack is back this Fall for an all-new monster comedy adventure in Hotel Transylvania 2, the theatrical sequel to Sony Pictures Animation's comedy hit, scheduled to be released in North America on September 25, 2015. Everything seems to be changing for the better at Hotel Transylvania. Dracula's rigid monster-only hotel policy has finally relaxed, opening up its doors to human guests. But behind closed coffins, Drac is worried that his adorable half-human, half-vampire grandson, Dennis, isn't showing signs of being a vampire. So while Mavis is busy visiting her human in-laws with Johnny - and in for a major cultural shock of her own - ""Vampa"" Drac enlists his friends Frank, Murray, Wayne and Griffin to put Dennis through a “monster-in-training” boot camp. But little do they know that Drac's grumpy and very old, old, old school dad Vlad is about to pay a family visit to the hotel. And when Vlad finds out that his great-grandson is not a pure blood - and humans are now welcome at Hotel Transylvania - things are going to get batty! Distribution for the Hotel Transylvania TV series will be handled by Sony Pictures Television in the U.S., while Nelvana Enterprises will distribute the series outside of the U.S. Sony Pictures Animation reserves global licenses for toys, games and publishing. For all other categories, Sony Pictures Animation reserves U.S. rights and Corus will hold international rights. Executive producing the series are Rick Mischel from Sony Pictures Animation and Colin Bohm and Irene Weibel from Nelvana. About Nelvana

In the VR experience, which was co-produced by MWM Immersive (formerly Madison Wells Media's Reality One), fans control their favorite movie characters as they build a team and set out to lift the curse of Jumanji while outwitting evil henchmen and evading dangerous wildlife.   ""SPVR is leading the way to build a new, multi-tiered distribution model for virtual reality.

In June, the studio unveiled Spider-Man: Homecoming VR, a multi-platform VR experience in which players don the superhero's costume and test their web-slinging skills.    In the motion picture Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, the game has changed as four teenagers in detention are sucked into the world of Jumanji. When they discover an old video game console with a game they've never heard of, they decide to play and are immediately thrust into the game's jungle setting, in the bodies of the avatar characters they chose (Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Karen Gillan). What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji - Jumanji plays you. To win, they'll have to go on the most dangerous adventure of their lives, or they'll be stuck in the game forever… Directed by Jake Kasdan, the screenplay is by Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers and Scott Rosenberg & Jeff Pinkner with a screen story by Chris McKenna, based on the book Jumanji by Chris Van Allsburg.

We're confident that Barbie will delight audiences, no matter where her adventures take her."" Parkes and MacDonald added, ""While it's an overused word, Barbie truly is a legend, a cultural symbol whose career choices have been as unlimited as her wardrobe.  She is about empowerment, but never at the expense of fun.  Our hope is to capture all of these aspects of Barbie in a modern take of the character that can appeal to moviegoers of all ages.""

Now is the right time in Barbie's celebrated history for her to star in a live-action, contemporary comedy that brings her playful personality to life for generations of fans,"" said Tim Kilpin, EVP Global Brands, Mattel.

" [Culver City, CA – April 29, 2019] Sony Pictures Television (SPT) today announced an expansive five-year overall television deal with Academy Award-winning and Emmy-nominated writers, directors, and producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller. The pair land at Sony after a highly competitive situation with multiple studios vying for the in-demand team. Under the exclusive new deal, Lord and Miller will develop live-action and animated series in both comedy and drama. The deal allows the pair to develop their own projects for network, cable and streaming platforms, as well as develop and supervise other writers’ projects. The duo will be involved in developing a suite of television series based on Sony’s Universe of Marvel Characters.
 
The deal expands Sony Picture Entertainment’s (SPE) existing relationship with Lord and Miller, who have a longstanding, fruitful relationship with the studio’s motion picture group. Past collaborations include 2009’s Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which marked the pair’s writing and directorial debut, 21 and 22 Jump Street and most recently Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which took home the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, among many other accolades. The duo have multiple feature projects in the works with the studio, including The Last Human, which Sony won in a highly competitive sale and is a live action tent-pole Lord and Miller are developing to direct.
 
All projects will be produced through the pair’s Lord Miller Productions. Aubrey Lee will continue in her role at Lord Miller as Vice President of TV Development and Production. Select television projects related to Sony’s Universe of Marvel Characters will be produced in partnership with Amy Pascal.
 
“This is a significant milestone for our television business, having the opportunity to work with two of the most creative forces in the industry in both our film and television businesses,” said Mike Hopkins, Chairman of Sony Pictures Television. “Building on our strong IP and creating new franchises has been a key focus for SPE, and the best way to do that is to invest in remarkable storytellers like Phil and Chris. We are thrilled to welcome them to the SPT family, and I want to thank Jeff, Chris and Jason for all their hard work in pulling this deal together.”
 
“Phil and Chris have reimagined every medium and genre they have touched,” said Sony Pictures Television President Jeff Frost.  “Whether it’s television, features or animation, they have created their own unique brand and style.  We are so excited to be working with these brilliant creators and showrunners and are looking forward to collaborating with them in every aspect of television - comedy, drama, animation and beyond.”
 
“We are so grateful to everyone at Sony Pictures Television for choosing to partner with us and expand our enduring relationship with the studio. Together we aim to make groundbreaking work of the highest quality and integrity, and to place that work in convenient proximity to your eyeballs and earholes, wherever you may be,” said Lord and Miller.
 
Known as auteurs who are recognized for their unique sensibilities, Lord and Miller have spent their careers pushing creative boundaries. From Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse which was praised for its cultural impact and technical innovation to The Lego Movie franchise which redefined what a blockbuster film could be, to the television series The Last Man Earth which took risks by launching an entire series on a singular character, Lord and Miller’s projects have earned them an Academy Award, an Emmy nomination, multiple BAFTA’s and their features have grossed over $3.3 billion at the worldwide box office. In addition to Last Human, Lord and Miller are also developing to direct the feature Artemis, based on the novel by The Martian author Andy Weir for Fox and New Regency. Their most recent television project, the animated series Bless The Harts, created by Emily Spivey premieres on Fox this fall.
 
Lord and Miller’s deal was brokered by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham LLP and completed prior the expiration of WGA/ATA’s franchise agreement on April 12th.

" CULVER CITY, Calif., December 5, 2013 - Sony Pictures and the large network of companies within the Sony family will unite worldwide today, Thursday, December 5, 2013, in support of the studio's teaser trailer for its highly anticipated film, The Amazing Spider-Man 2™. The launch event was announced today by Dwight Caines, president of Theatrical Marketing for Sony Pictures, and Nigel Clark, president of Marketing for Sony Pictures Releasing International. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 will be released in theaters internationally beginning April 16, 2014, and domestically on May 2, 2014. The trailer will launch worldwide today at 1:30 p.m. GMT (8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST) and will be available in multiple languages including English, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese Simplified (China), Chinese Traditional (Taiwan), Chinese Traditional (Hong Kong), Korean, and Russian. The trailer will appear on numerous Sony networks, internet sites, and other Sony properties, including the movie's official site (TheAmazingSpiderMan.com) and social pages (at Facebook.com/theamazingspiderman, on Twitter @SpiderManMovie, theamazingspidermanblog.com, and thedailybugle.tumblr.com); Sony.com; Sony Pictures' official site and social pages; the Sony Pictures YouTube channel; Sony Pictures Imageworks' official site and social page; Sony Pictures Television Networks' worldwide footprint of TV channels, digital networks, websites, social apps and platforms, including AXN, Animax, Sony Entertainment Television, Spin, Crackle, Kalixta, Sony Movie Channel, CineSony, FEARnet, and the Game Show Network; PlayStation (official site, blog, and social pages); PlayStation Storefront; Sony Entertainment Network (official sites and social pages); Sony Electronics social pages; Sony Mobile social pages; Sony Select service on Sony Mobile smartphones; and Sony's Times Square billboard. Commenting on the announcement, Caines said, ""We are always looking to reach moviegoers wherever they are, and when we have the opportunity to leverage Sony's worldwide reach in this way, it's an opportunity that we just have to grab. The filmmakers are delivering the epic Spider-Man movie that audiences truly want to experience, and we are thrilled to give the world its first real taste of the movie they'll be seeing next summer."" Clark added, ""Spider-Man is beloved by audiences all over the world, so we wanted to launch the trailer in a truly global way. We have had great success launching trailers across Sony's diverse entertainment platform - and when you have a character like Spider-Man, it demands a broad, fun way to reach moviegoers internationally as well as domestically. Everyone at Sony is just as excited as we are to see the next chapter in the story of Peter Parker begin to unfold in this way."" We've always known that Spider-Man's most important battle has been within himself: the struggle between the ordinary obligations of Peter Parker and the extraordinary responsibilities of Spider-Man. But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that a greater conflict lies ahead. It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: OsCorp. Directed by Marc Webb. Produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach. Screen Story and Screenplay by Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci & Jeff Pinkner. Based on the Marvel Comic Book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.

The year has been driven by the success of a number of breakthrough hits in the international marketplace.  The studio's most recent blockbuster is 2012, from director Roland Emmerich, which opened this past weekend to more than $165 million internationally ($230.4 million worldwide) and has yet to open in such markets as Japan, where it is expected to perform solidly. 
Also contributing to the overseas record is Columbia Pictures' Angels & Demons, which opened in May and has taken in over $352 million in foreign markets.  Sony Pictures Releasing International distributed Terminator Salvation in many overseas countries, taking in $220.6 million in SPRI's territories.  District 9 proved popular around the world, too, taking in $88 million overseas, including $67.7 million from SPRI territories.  Columbia's The Ugly Truth, a modestly budgeted comedy, took in more than $112 million from international audiences (and still going).  Finally, Michael Jackson fans around the world have driven Michael Jackson's THIS IS IT to $155.2 million internationally so far and more than $222 million worldwide. 
Commenting on the announcement, Blake said, ""Our performance this year re-emphasizes the importance of the international marketplace and the enormous value of a release slate with global appeal.

" CULVER CITY, CA. - June 13, 2013 - After conquering the global box office with their first 3D trip to the big screen in the live-action/CG animated global smash hit The Smurfs™, the world's favorite three-apple-high heroes are back on July 31 in Columbia Pictures / Sony Pictures Animation's The Smurfs 2 - and just as with the first film, Sony Pictures Consumer Marketing has teamed with corporations and licensees around the world to create a global promotional campaign that stands among the largest the studio has ever produced, it was announced today by George Leon, executive vice president, Consumer Marketing for Sony Pictures Entertainment. Building on the success of The Smurfs, which took in upwards of $563 million at the global box office, Sony Pictures has amassed a program with more than 100 partners - from McDonald's to Wal-Mart to Toys R Us to the Discover the Forest public service advertising (PSA) campaign, and even blueberries! In doing so, the studio is going beyond the traditional promotional partner approach to offer a multi-generational lifestyle-based program that takes Smurf enthusiasts from the fashion runway to social media channels, and from mass merchant and department store-based programs to quick service restaurant experiences, allowing consumers to interact with the Smurfs in ways they never have before. Many of the key promotional partners from the first film are returning to join in the Smurfs 2 campaign, and they are joined by a host of fresh, relevant, and exciting promotional partners, that, combined, will more than double the total number of promotional partners involved and triple the total promotional value and marketing support for The Smurfs 2, giving consumers the ability to ""live"" the Smurfs brand and discover the Magic of Family. ""The success we had with the first film went way beyond even our wildest expectations - merchandise flew off the shelves, and in some cases, completely sold out,"" said Leon. ""Because we had such a great experience on the first film, we were able to re-assemble the anchor promotional partners from the last campaign and build on them with an expansive new program, and this time, retailers are taking a bigger position on Smurfs product to meet increased consumer demand. Each of these collaborations - whether new, returning or expanding - is a true testament to the broad appeal of The Smurfs. Across generations, demographics and lifestyle categories, The Smurfs interact with consumers in ways few other brands do."" The Smurfs 2 promotional partnership highlights include:     In addition to these many retail and promotional partners, the Smurfs are also giving back as they team up with Discover the Forest, a PSA campaign designed to encourage children and their families to reconnect with nature. Developed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Ad Council in partnership with Sony Pictures, Discover the Forest will be launching Smurf-centric PSAs which will be distributed nationwide and run in donated time and space. The campaign includes social and web portals that inspire families with ideas and activities for how to enjoy the benefits of the forest all year long, including a Smurfs activity sheet with fun forest facts about the Smurf and their natural habitat. In this truly global campaign, The Smurfs 2 will be smurfing the world blue with key promotional partners.     In The Smurfs™ 2, the sequel to Columbia Pictures / Sony Pictures Animation's hybrid live action/animated family blockbuster comedy The Smurfs™, the evil wizard Gargamel creates a couple of mischievous Smurf-like creatures called the Naughties that he hopes will let him harness the all-powerful, magical Smurf-essence. But when he discovers that only a real Smurf can give him what he wants, and only a secret spell that Smurfette knows can turn the Naughties into real Smurfs, Gargamel kidnaps Smurfette and brings her to Paris, where he has been winning the adoration of millions as the world's greatest sorcerer. It's up to Papa, Clumsy, Grouchy, and Vanity to return to our world, reunite with their human friends Patrick and Grace Winslow, and rescue her! Will Smurfette, who has always felt different from the other Smurfs, find a new connection with the Naughties Vexy and Hackus or will the Smurfs convince her that their love for her is True Blue? The film is directed by Raja Gosnell and produced by Jordan Kerner. The screenplay is by J. David Stem & David N. Weiss and Jay Scherick & David Ronn and Karey Kirkpatrick with a story by J. David Stem & David N. Weiss & Jay Scherick & David Ronn, Based on the Characters and Works of Peyo. About the Smurfs

" London, 25 Sept, 2012. Sony Pictures Television's Dutch production venture, Tuvalu Media, has secured a commission with SBS to produce Stories from the Hospital a new reality format based on the hit US drama series, Strong Medicine. The Dutch broadcaster has ordered a series of 30 half hour episodes for NET5, SBS's female-skewing channel aimed at the 20-34 year old demographic. The series, called Dokters locally, will be stripped weekdays in a primetime 8pm slot, launching in late October. SPT's international production and distribution teams will also launch the new format to international buyers at MIPCOM. Stories From the Hospital is a ground-breaking combination of carefully plotted storytelling and intimate, true to life experiences about patients and their doctors. Each episode will use the self-contained storylines from the US drama scripts played out by participants whose real life experiences mirrored those of the drama's characters. The Dutch series developer and producer is Vincent ter Voert. ""They say 'life imitates art' and this new format will soon have it imitating television as well,"" says Tuvalu Media joint managing director, Duurt Holman. ""Drama plots can seem far-fetched but Stories From the Hospital proves this wrong as authentic characters and experiences give a second, and very real, life to what was previously only fiction."" All episodes in the series are self-contained, enabling audiences to engage at anytime. Many key characters are played by real people who fit the profile of characters from the drama series, sometimes having endured parallel experiences. The original drama series, Strong Medicine, was produced by SPT for Lifetime, with 130 episodes created. The series followed the lives of staff in the women's health clinic of a fictitious hospital in Philadelphia. Strong Medicine was created by Tammy Ader and executive produced by Ader, Whoopi Goldberg, Diane Messina Stanley, Jim Stanley and John Flynn.

" London, 31 March 2011: GroupM Entertainment and Sony Pictures Television's 2waytraffic have combined forces to launch the world's first ever magic based game show to the global market, as they bring Impossible? to MIP TV next week. Created by UK production house, Gogglebox Entertainment, and co-produced with GroupM Entertainment, Impossible? is a high stakes, battle of wits between contestants and a professional illusionist. Ahead of its Cannes debut, Impossible? has been commissioned by UK network, Channel 5, and is in production for primetime launch later this season. International interest is already growing with several options in discussion. Across five rounds in this unique format, the illusionist sets up a series of spectacular and seemingly impossible feats. The contestants' dilemma is to decide whether what he's proposing is indeed possible or impossible? If it's possible, the magic is played out in front of them, but even in a magical world, some things are impossible. Deciding which is which, is tough for the contestants right from the start, and it only becomes tougher as their sense of what is possible and what's not, is stretched to the limit. Call it right and they can win major cash prizes. Impossible? offers audiences the brand new experience of spectacular magic alongside gameshow jeopardy with all the drama, tension, entertainment and play-along of both. GroupM Entertainment Managing Director Richard Foster said, ""We were excited by the initial idea from Gogglebox and thoroughly enjoyed realising the idea for Channel 5 in the UK. We're equally excited by the possibilities of the show internationally, and look forward to working with 2waytraffic, providing support where required to help broadcasters realise local versions."" 2waytraffic Managing Director, Ed Louwerse, said, ""From Harry Houdini to David Blaine, the art of illusion is one of the most powerful ways to captivate and entertain audiences everywhere. Combining these jaw-dropping illusions with the competition of a game show, Impossible? is a brilliant new way to create compelling, appointment viewing across all age groups and nationalities."" Illusionist, Philip Escoffey, will host and perform in the UK version of Impossible? for Channel 5. Escoffey will be attending MIPTV to present a special illusion event at the Sony Pictures Television stand.  Editors Notes ABOUT GROUPM ENTERTAINMENT

" 
CULVER CITY, CA (September 28, 2009) - Sony Pictures Entertainment, in conjunction with Sony Music Entertainment, today announced that the first 24-hours of pre-sales activity for Michael Jackson's This Is It has resulted in record-breaking sales throughout the world as fans secure the first tickets to the two-week, limited engagement of the highly-anticipated motion picture.
		 
With reports still coming in from nations around the world, it is believed no movie in history has generated so many ticket sales so far in advance of its release.
		 
In North America, online ticket sellers Fandango and MovieTickets.com report that there is extraordinary demand for the film with hundreds of showtimes already sold out after one day of pre-sales. Some 80% of all online ticketing service transactions were for the film, which will debut in some markets with special advance showings the evening of Tuesday, October 27 and will open worldwide on Wednesday, October 28. The film is directed by long-time Jackson collaborator Kenny Ortega.
		 
Domestically, an unprecedented number of shows for the two-week engagement have sold out in the first 24 hours of ticket availability in locations from coast-to-coast, including such cities as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Nashville and New York, among others. Internationally, exhibitors from London and Sydney to Bangkok and Tokyo have experienced the same epic demand.
		 
In London, Vue Entertainment's Film Buying Director Stuart Boreman said Michael Jackson's This Is It sold more than 30,000 tickets in its first 24-hours, setting the biggest ever one-day sales record in the UK, eclipsing advance buying for films including Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. ""I've never seen anything like it in the 25 years I have been film buying,"" Boreman said. ""It's a true phenomenon and sales show no sign of slowing down."" 
		 
In the United States, more than 500,000 fans performed searches for showtimes on the official www.thisisit-movie.com website. Online buzz for Michael Jackson's This Is It was 60 percent higher Sunday than for any other upcoming film.
		 
Commenting on the extraordinary results, Rory Bruer, President of Worldwide Theatrical Distribution for Sony Picture Releasing said, ""Michael Jackson's fans all over the globe have enormous interest in this film and we can assure they will not be disappointed. This film delivers on everything they hope and expect to see.  I think the initial sales activity we are seeing in the United States and United Kingdom to countries such as Australia and Thailand underscores the unique nature of this film, which is a special celebration of Michael and his music.""
		 
In Japan, more than $1 million in ticket sales were recorded within the first 24 hours of their release, setting an advanced-sales record unmatched by any movie in history.
		 
Staggering advance sales were reported in Australia, where tickets for Michael Jackson's This Is It purchased through Village Cinemas exceeded the lifetime pre-sales of such blockbusters as Transformers, and X-Men Origins.
		 
In Bangkok, Thailand, fans lined up at box office ticket counters throughout the city, and by the end of the first day, all tickets for the first showings across Bangkok were sold-out. 
		 
In Los Angeles, at Regal Cinema's LA LIVE Stadium 14, fans began lining up on Thursday night for tickets to some of the city's first public showings, and within hours of Sunday morning's starting bell for advance pre-sales, the exhibitor reported selling out of all 3,000 of their seats for shows on Tuesday night October 27th.
		 
Sell-outs at theaters in France are also being reported; thousands of fans lined up at The Grand Rex in Paris and quickly bought out the film's first screening there.  Record-setting sales also were recorded in Germany; hundreds of fans lined up outside one theater in Munich at midnight to await the opening of the box office. As one German exhibitor noted, ""Something like this never happened before in Germany.""
		 
Record sales and sell-outs are also being reported in Holland, Sweden, Belgium and New Zealand, among other countries.
		 
Moviegoers worldwide can get information for the two-week limited engagement by visiting www.thisisit-movie.com.  For fans wishing to discover the closest theater playing the film near their home in North America, please call (877) 488-4258.
		 
Michael Jackson's This Is It will offer Jackson fans and music lovers worldwide a rare, behind-the-scenes look at the performer as he developed, created and rehearsed for his sold-out concerts that would have taken place beginning this summer in London's O2 Arena.  Chronicling the months from March through June, 2009, the film is produced with the full support of the Estate of Michael Jackson and drawn from more than one hundred hours of behind-the-scenes footage, featuring Jackson rehearsing a number of his songs for the show. Audiences will be given a privileged and private look at Jackson as he has never been seen before.

Following the success of the series in Russia, known there as The Voronins, SPT has sold 30 episodes of the Emmy® Award-winning comedy to TVN in Poland, and 33 episodes to Reshet in Israel.  SPT will jointly produce both versions. ""We're thrilled to extend our successful track record of producing quality local language scripted programs with the universally-themed and universally funny Everybody Loves Raymond,"" said Jeff Lerner, senior vice president, international scripted development and production, SPT.  ""With the expertise of our producers and the talented local producers joining forces, we're certain viewers in Poland and Israel will soon love Raymond as much as we do!"" ""We fell in love with Raymond as Everybody did! After a great experience with SPT on 'The Nanny,' we're looking forward to another successful show,"" said Dariusz Gąsiorowski, Head of TVN's Drama and Feature Production Department. ""The original version, with its universal humor and memorable characters, offers us the unique opportunity to create an amazing show. We hope that our viewers will have as much fun watching it as we will while adapting it, preparing the production and being in the process."" ""We are very excited to be selected by Sony Pictures Television to produce and broadcast Everybody Loves Raymond in Israel,"" said Ilan de Vries, VP content for ""Reshet"" channel 2 in Israel.  ""This is the first time in the history of Israeli television that such a successful program of this magnitude will be launched.  We are sure that everybody in Israel will love the show.""

The action-comedy stars Academy Award® nominee James Franco (Best Actor, 127 Hours, 2010) as a celebrity talk show host and Seth Rogen (Neighbors) as his producer longing to make the jump to serious news.

CULVER CITY, Calif., January 11, 2010  - Peter Parker is going back to high school when the next Spider-Man hits theaters in the summer of 2012. 
		 
Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios announced today they are moving forward with a film based on a script by James Vanderbilt that focuses on a teenager dealing with both contemporary human problems and amazing super-human crises. 
The new chapter in the Spider-Man franchise produced by Columbia, Marvel Studios and Avi Arad and Laura Ziskin, will have a new cast and filmmaking team. Spider-Man 4 was to have been released in 2011, but had not yet gone into production.	 
""A decade ago we set out on this journey with Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire and together we made three Spider-Man films that set a new bar for the genre. When we began, no one ever imagined that we would make history at the box-office and now we have a rare opportunity to make history once again with this franchise. Peter Parker as an ordinary young adult grappling with extraordinary powers has always been the foundation that has made this character so timeless and compelling for generations of fans. We're very excited about the creative possibilities that come from returning to Peter's roots and we look forward to working once again with Marvel Studios, Avi Arad and Laura Ziskin on this new beginning,"" said Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. 
""Working on the Spider-Man movies was the experience of a lifetime for me. While we were looking forward to doing a fourth one together, the studio and Marvel have a unique opportunity to take the franchise in a new direction, and I know they will do a terrific job,"" said Sam Raimi. 
""We have had a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration and friendship with Sam and Tobey and they have given us their best for the better part of the last decade.This is a bittersweet moment for us because while it is hard to imagine Spider-Man in anyone else's hands, I know that this was a day that was inevitable,"" said Matt Tolmach, president of Columbia Pictures, who has served as the studio's chief production executive since the beginning of the franchise. “Now everything begins anew, and that's got us all tremendously excited about what comes next.  Under the continuing supervision of Avi and Laura, we have a clear vision for the future of Spider-Man and can't wait to share this exciting new direction with audiences in 2012."" 
""Spider-Man will always be an important franchise for Sony Pictures and a fresh start like this is a responsibility that we all take very seriously,"" said Michael Lynton, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures.  ""We have always believed that story comes first and story guides the direction of these films. As we move onto the next chapter, we will stay true to that principle and will do so with the highest respect for the source material and the fans and moviegoers who deserve nothing but the best when it comes to bringing these stories and characters to life on the big screen.""   
The studio will have more news about Spider-Man in 2012 in the coming weeks as it prepares for production of the film.

" London, 29 March 2011. Sony Pictures Television's formats arm, 2waytraffic, will launch a strong slate of new game show and reality formats at next week's MIP TV, alongside its well established classic hits. The new offering is drawn from 2waytraffic's global network, with innovative propositions from international third party producers and Sony Pictures Television's production hubs around the world. The slate includes proven hits from as far afield as the US, Japan and the Netherlands, with formats such as Second Chance Hotel, Bangers & Cash, Power & Brain and Cover Me to debut at the Cannes market. Cover Me is a weekly, music-based entertainment show from Tuvalu Media and has been a ratings hit for TROS in the Netherlands; it doubled its audience over an eight week, primetime run and a second season has just been recommissioned. Each episode see two music stars, worlds apart in age and taste, given seven days to bridge their generation gap and create new hits based on each other's work. Cover Me is hosted by an established rap music star who challenges contemporary performers to cover iconic pop hits by major artistes from very different eras and genres. At the same time those veteran stars are challenged to leave their comfort zones and make a musical connection with a modern day hit that is totally alien to them. Bangers & Cash is a weekly, one-hour factual entertainment format devised by Gogglebox Entertainment. Already produced for VOX by SPT Germany, Bangers & Cash increased both daypart and individual slot averages, and skewed significantly in favour of the target 14-49 year old male demographic (63% of viewership) when it aired last December. The series reveals the secrets of the auto trade and how to earn serious cash from cars that look ready for the crusher. In charge is a glamorous, fast-talking auto-trade expert. She answers distress calls from people whose dilapidated cars (ie bangers) are ruining their lives. To succeed she needs the assistance of a team of top restoration experts, world-class bargaining skills and a friendly auto dealer. The show culminates with the owner having to spot their transformed car in a busy car park - does the final product impress or does the owner get their money back? Second Chance Hotel is a weekly one-hour format from NieheMedia, recently broadcast on RTL4 in the Netherlands. The series sets up eight unemployed participants together to live in and re-open a run down hotel. In roles that range from barman and receptionist to cleaner, cook and marketing executive, they must re-launch the Second Chance Hotel and earn the right to carry on working there. The hotel boss and mentors offer on the job training, but stakes are high, time is short and there is plenty of pressure, making for highly charged reality television. Power & Brain Battle is a weekly one-hour game show produced by NTV Japan, the makers of Dragon's Den. It's a high tension game show where three outstanding athletes and three super-sharp thinkers pick their partners to form teams of two - Power and Brain - and the battle begins. Based on dramatic tasks that test both brains and brawn to the limit, this game show contest depends on teamwork, skill and downright strength as contestants battle for the big cash prize. Returning 2waytraffic hits at MIP TV will include The Sing Off, just recommissioned for a third season by NBC, as well as global hits Dragon's Den (22 local versions now broadcast in 38 territories, including a recent renewals in the UK and Canada) and Who Wants to Be Millionaire (licensed in over 120 territories).

The audience for MEN IN BLACK 3 is a perfect match for this footage - there's something new here for everyone, and we think this six minutes of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN will get everyone excited for what we have in store."" ""Having seen the spectacular footage I'm even more excited for IMAX moviegoers to experience this new chapter in the story of Peter Parker in anticipation of the film's release in our theatres,"" said Greg Foster, Chairman and President, IMAX Filmed Entertainment. One of the world's most popular characters is back on the big screen as a new chapter in the Spider-Man legacy is revealed in THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN™. Focusing on an untold story that tells a different side of the Peter Parker story, the new film stars Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Rhys Ifans, Denis Leary, Campbell Scott, Irrfan Khan, with Martin Sheen and Sally Field. The film is directed by Marc Webb from a screenplay written by James Vanderbilt and Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves from a story by James Vanderbilt, based on the Marvel Comic Book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad, and Matt Tolmach are producing the film in association with Marvel Entertainment for Columbia Pictures, which will open in theaters everywhere in 3D on July 3, 2012. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is the story of Peter Parker (Garfield), an outcast high schooler who was abandoned by his parents as a boy, leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field). Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone), and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero. In MEN IN BLACK™ 3, Agents J (played by Will Smith) and K (played by Tommy Lee Jones) are back... in time. J has seen some inexplicable things in his 15 years with the Men in Black, but nothing, not even aliens, perplexes him as much as his wry, reticent partner. But when K's life and the fate of the planet are put at stake, Agent J will have to travel back in time to put things right. J discovers that there are secrets to the universe that K never told him — secrets that will reveal themselves as he teams up with the young Agent K (played by Josh Brolin) to save his partner, the agency, and the future of humankind. Barry Sonnenfeld directs the film. The film's screenplay is written by Etan Cohen, based on the Malibu Comic by Lowell Cunningham. Walter F. Parkes and Laurie MacDonald produce, and Steven Spielberg and G. Mac Brown are the executive producers. About Sony Pictures Entertainment

" Colorist John Persichetti helps cinematographer Anastas N. Michos, ASC recreate the look of Motown. Culver City, Calif. - August 20, 2012 - Colorworks, Sony Pictures Entertainments' digital intermediate facility, recently completed final post work for Sparkle, the new movie from Tri-Star Pictures, starring Jordin Sparks and Whitney Houston. Digital intermediate colorist John Persichetti worked under the supervision of director Salim Akil and cinematographer Anastas N. Michos, ASC in performing final color grading for the film. A remake of the 1976 film of the same name, Sparkle tells the story of three sisters who form a singing group in 1960s Detroit. It is a family drama that plays out against the glitz of Motown and the political and social tumult of the era. In grading the film, part of the challenge was to capture the flavor and essence of Detroit in the 1960s, both its working class neighborhoods and the many small clubs where Motown dreams were born. ""Detroit in the Sixties was a vibrant industrial city,"" observes Michos. ""It was the center of the music industry and the auto industry, the heartland of America."" Certain combinations of bold, rich colors were typical of the era. Those color patterns, evident in costuming and production design, were accentuated and sharpened in post production. ""The costumes and set design were spectacular,"" notes Persichetti. ""We built on that, but were careful not to push the colors into a direction that would have been unrealistic for the time. They used colors that you just don't see anymore—olive green rugs and things like that—and we wanted to keep that true."" Particularly challenging was recreating the atmosphere of Detroit's smoky nightclubs. ""The rooms were very colorful but they were often underlit,"" Persichetti notes. ""So, we let some of the dark areas go very dark to the point that you can't see the audience, but that's how it would have been."" While verisimilitude was important, Michos points out that Sparkle is not a documentary or a bio-pic, but rather a musical drama about stardom. It required an element of glamor, especially during performance sequences. ""When we move in for a close up, we want the performers to look their best,"" he explains. ""The scenes need to pop and the women should look like stars, because that's what they are."" Persichetti employed a variety of techniques to accentuate the star quality of the film's lead performers. He used tools to isolate details to achieve consistency in skin tones and to tone down a colorful costume to keep it from distracting from an actress's face. ""Salim was insistent that the actresses always look beautiful,"" he recalls. ""The three central actresses have different skin tones and we adjusted somewhat for that. Our aim was to make them look their best, even when they were wearing curlers."" Color, then, plays an important part in establishing the mood and aesthetics of the story. ""The Detroit Riots and the Viet Nam War were part of the era of this film, so it has very serious undertones, but it is also the story of a girl band, so it has romance,"" observes Michos. ""The film has a lot of arcs and we follow them with camera movement and with a color palette. With Colorworks' help we were able to give this modestly budgeted film a big-budget look.""

" CULVER CITY, Calif., January 5, 2011 — As The Social Network, the most critically acclaimed film of the year, is set to launch on DVD, the hit film is poised to pass $200 million at the worldwide box office, it was announced today by Jeff Blake, chairman, Worldwide Marketing and Distribution for Sony Pictures. To date, The Social Network has grossed more than $93 million in the US and $104 million overseas, and will pass the $200 million mark in the next few days. The DVD will be released on January 11, 2011, and contains more than eight hours of bonus extras about the motion picture. The film will also be re-released in approximately 600 theaters nationwide on January 7. Commenting on the announcement, Blake said, ""The Social Network has struck a chord with audiences all around the world. No invention defines our era like Facebook does, but what has made it break through as a motion picture is that it is a parable for our time. Everyone, everywhere, can relate to the human motivations of the real-life people who are depicted in the film. At the box office, this film showed true staying power, grossing more than four times its opening weekend gross - a rare accomplishment when the average for wide releases last year was below three times its opening weekend gross. It is always a great feeling to see a film connect with moviegoers, but this film is incredibly special to us - we are as proud of it as any film in our studio's history."" The Social Network has been embraced during this year's awards season, with four honors from the National Board of Review, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor for Jesse Eisenberg. The film has also received six Golden Globe nominations, including Best Picture - Drama, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score, and nominations for Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield, as well as two nominations from the Screen Actors Guild, including Ensemble and Eisenberg for Best Actor, and nominations for Best Picture from the Producers Guild of America and Best Adapted Screenplay from the Writers Guild of America. The film has also been named Best Picture by 24 critics groups, including the New York Film Critics Circle, the New York Film Critics Online, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the Chicago Film Critics Association, the San Francisco Film Critics, the Boston Society of Film Critics, the Dallas/Ft. Worth Film Critics Association, the Washington Area Film Critics Association, the Toronto Film Critics Association, the UK Regional Critics Awards, Sight and Sound, the Village Voice/LA Weekly Critics Poll, the African American Film Critics Association, the Black Film Critics Circle, the Southeastern Film Critics Association, the Houston Film Critics Society, the Detroit Film Critics Society, the Florida Film Critics Circle Awards, the St. Louis Film Critics Association, the Indiana Film Journalist Awards, the Utah Film Critics Association, the Oklahoma Film Critics Circle, and the Las Vegas Film Critics Society. The film also appears on over 350 critics' Top Ten lists. The film has been named Best Picture of the Year by numerous publications, including The New York Times, New York Post, The New Yorker, Los Angeles Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, LA Weekly, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, Chicago Sun-Times, Denver Post, Boston Phoenix, Cleveland Sun, the Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph, the Huffington Post, IFC.com, Miami Herald, Lincoln Journal-Star, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, MSN Movies, North County Times, Oklahoma Gazette, Omaha World Herald, Orlando Weekly, Sight & Sound, Time Out Chicago, Time Out New York, and Tulsa World, among many others. In The Social Network, director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin explore the moment at which Facebook, the most revolutionary social phenomenon of the new century, was invented - through the warring perspectives of the super-smart young men who each claimed to be there at its inception. Drawn from multiple sources, the film moves from the halls of Harvard to the cubicles of Palo Alto as it captures the visceral thrill of the heady early days of a culture-changing phenomenon in the making - and the way it both pulled a group of young revolutionaries together and then split them apart. In the midst of the chaos are Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the brilliant Harvard student who conceived a website that seemed to redefine our social fabric overnight; Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), once Zuckerberg's close friend, who provided the seed money for the fledgling company; Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who brought Facebook to Silicon Valley's venture capitalists; and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence), the Harvard classmates who asserted that Zuckerberg stole their idea and then sued him for ownership of it. Each has his own narrative, his own version of the Facebook story - but they add up to more than the sum of their parts in what becomes a multi-level portrait of 21st Century success - both the youthful fantasy of it and its finite realities as well. The film is produced by Scott Rudin, Dana Brunetti, Michael De Luca, and Cean Chaffin and based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich.

" CULVER CITY, Calif., September 8, 2015 - Albert R. Broccoli's EON Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment today confirmed that Sam Smith has recorded ""Writing's On The Wall,"" the theme song to SPECTRE, the 24th James Bond adventure. SPECTRE will be released in the UK on October 26 and in the US on November 6. The song, released by Capitol Records, will debut and be available to purchase and stream on September 25. Multi-platinum selling artist Sam Smith has co-written the title song, ""Writing's On The Wall,"" with fellow GRAMMY® Award winner Jimmy Napes. It is the first James Bond theme song recorded by a British male solo artist since 1965. Smith's debut album In The Lonely Hour launched at No. 1 in the UK and bowed in at No. 2 in the US, and has since earned five No.1 UK singles, four GRAMMY® Awards, three Brit Awards, six MOBO Awards, Q and AMA Awards. Commenting on the announcement, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the producers of SPECTRE, said, ""Sam and Jimmy have written the most inspirational song for Spectre and with Sam's extraordinary vocal performance, 'Writing's On The Wall' will surely be considered one of the greatest Bond songs of all time."" Smith said: ""This is one of the highlights of my career. I am honoured to finally announce that I will be singing the next Bond theme song. I am so excited to be a part of this iconic British legacy and join an incredible line up of some of my biggest musical inspirations. I hope you all enjoy the song as much as I enjoyed making it."" The 23 previous James Bond theme songs make up some of the most memorable movie music of all time. The previous Bond theme song, ""Skyfall,"" was performed by Adele, and was honored with the Academy Award® and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, the Brit Award for British Single of the Year, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media. ABOUT ""SPECTRE""
A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond (Daniel Craig) on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra (Monica Bellucci), the beautiful and forbidden widow of an infamous criminal. Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE. Meanwhile back in London, Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott), the new head of the Centre for National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6, led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) to help him seek out Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr White (Jesper Christensen), who may hold the clue to untangling the web of SPECTRE. As the daughter of an assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of SPECTRE, he learns of a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks, played by Christoph Waltz. Sam Mendes returns to direct SPECTRE, with Daniel Craig reprising his role as 007 for the fourth time. SPECTRE is produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli. The screenplay is by John Logan and Neal Purvis & Robert Wade and Jez Butterworth, with a story by John Logan and Neal Purvis & Robert Wade. SPECTRE is set for release in the UK on October 26, 2015, and in the US on November 6, 2015. About Albert R. Broccoli's EON Productions

" CULVER CITY, CA (May 10, 2013) - Virgin Produced, the film and television arm of the Virgin Group, has teamed up with Overbrook Entertainment on a non-exclusive pact, which will support the After Earth franchise, starting with the upcoming May 31st release, it was announced today by Jason Felts, CEO of Virgin Produced, and James Lassiter of Overbrook Entertainment. This pact allows Virgin Produced the option to co-produce, co-finance and co-market a sequel to After Earth.  The two companies will look to develop film and television properties together, in which Virgin Produced would co-produce and market across its expansive global platforms. The pact marks a natural relationship for both Virgin Produced and Overbrook as it reinforces both companies' missions: to find projects that entertain as well as educate, with ideas that leap off the entertainment page and into the national conversation. As Overbrook's After Earth shares many of the themes that Virgin is committed to: it focuses on the future that awaits the human race if it continues on its destructive environmental path and raises important questions about the present state of the planet, the future, and the environment. As one of the most respected talent friendly brands, it is anticipated that the alignment with Overbrook is the first in several talent owned production company alignments as Virgin Produced increases its growth under the direction of co-founder Jason Felts.  Commenting on the announcement, Felts said, ""This deal makes perfect sense for us, both in a thematic sense and as a company.  At Virgin, we believe it's important to give mankind a heightened awareness of the nature and vulnerability of our planet.  For example, we have to travel to space to look down and see how fragile the earth is; certainly, the film takes that message to heart in both literal and figurative ways.  As a company, we saw the opportunity to team up with one of the industry's leading film and television production companies that also embraces this mission.  That's why we're excited to partner with Overbrook on future films.” Lassiter added, ""We are excited for the opportunity to join forces with Virgin Produced.  We believe they share our ultimate goal: to create entertainment that also uplifts and educates.  Simply, we both believe that entertainment can be a force for good in the world - and we think both companies are leaders in that aspect.  That's why this deal is a natural fit."" Virgin Produced, with a focus on quality product, is breaking the mold amongst producers / production companies with the ability to attract top talent and market its movies across Virgin's global marketing platform. Virgin Produced, since its inception in 2010, has co-produced and marketed a half-dozen films, primarily through its former overall deal with Relativity Media, which now has Virgin Produced operating independently. In After Earth, a crash landing leaves teenager Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) and his legendary father Cypher (Will Smith) stranded on Earth 1,000 years after cataclysmic events forced humanity's escape. With Cypher critically injured, Kitai must embark on a perilous journey to signal for help, facing uncharted terrain, evolved animal species that now rule the planet, and an unstoppable alien creature that escaped during the crash. Father and son must learn to work together and trust one another if they want any chance of returning home. Columbia Pictures presents an Overbrook Entertainment/Blinding Edge Pictures production directed by M. Night Shyamalan from a screenplay by Gary Whitta and M. Night Shyamalan and a story by Will Smith, and produced by Caleeb Pinkett, Jada Pinkett Smith & Will Smith, James Lassiter, and M. Night Shyamalan. ABOUT VIRGIN PRODUCEDVirgin Produced serves as the film and television development, packaging and production arm of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group. Led by co-founders CEO Jason Felts and Chief Creative Officer Justin Berfield, Virgin Produced is breaking the corrosive models of Old Hollywood by providing a collaborative environment that embraces talent so they can best create and inspire. Putting quality and innovation first, with an equal focus on television and film, Virgin Produced has co-produced box office successes Limitless and Immortals, Movie 43 and its most recent release, comedy 21 & Over. Virgin Produced recently produced the award winning short film Departure Date. In April 2012, Virgin Produced launched its own television network, the Virgin Produced Channel, which programs high quality lifestyle, music, travel, technology and comedy content to Virgin operating companies in the transportation, mobile, broadband, radio, health club, hotel and retail industries estimated to reach 60+ million loyal Virgin brand fans globally on a daily basis. ABOUT OVERBROOK ENTERTAINMENTOverbrook Entertainment, founded by partners James Lassiter, Will Smith and run along with partner Jada Pinkett Smith, is committed to offering the highest quality entertainment focused in film and television and has produced a diverse slate of both critically acclaimed and blockbuster feature films, which have generated more than $2.5 billion dollars in worldwide box office receipts and even more in home video sales.

" NEW YORK, NY (May 7, 2012) - The Emmy® Award-winning, critically acclaimed and nationally syndicated ""The Dr. Oz Show"" today proudly announced the top ten finalists to earn a spot in the show's season-long initiative, Dr. Oz's Transformation Nation: Million Dollar You. Beginning today, viewers can vote on which finalist they feel should win the grand prize of $1 million by going to www.doctoroz.com. The winner will be announced on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" scheduled to air on May 23rd. Since the health challenge launched on September 26, 2011, Over 1.2 million people have registered for the seven step program that transforms their overall health. The steps include weight loss, knowing family health history, sleep hygiene, stress reduction, fitness and forming a relationship with their doctor. The 1.2 million registrants answered questionnaires and quizzes at the conclusion of each step, and a weigh-in with Weight Watchers required at the start and finish of the program. Through a partnership with Weight Watchers, registrants entered their starting weight through a complimentary weigh-in at a Weight Watchers center, and also recorded a final weight in the same manner. People were required to lose 10% of their body weight or reach or maintain a healthy BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. Seven judges poured over the submissions of the top 50 contestants after an algorithm identified those with the highest scoring value. The group of 50 was required to submit a personal narrative essay describing their personal transformation, motivation and detail of their experience. The seven judges were: Best-selling author and meditation expert Dr. Deepak Chopra, talk show host Rachael Ray, Center for Disease Control deputy director Dr. Ileana Arias, fitness trainer Jorge Cruise, Weight Watchers Leader Liz Josefsberg, sleep physician Michael Breus, M.D., and Dr. Vonda Wright. The finalists are:   The winner will be selected through a voting process that goes from May 7 thru May 13, 2012. Viewers will vote on ""The Dr. Oz Show"" website (www.doctoroz.com) where they can read personal stories, and watch videos of the finalists. Dr. Oz's Transformation Nation: Million Dollar You will culminate in a grand finale where one winner will be awarded the $1 million prize on the May 23 episode of ""The Dr. Oz Show."" ""Let America draw inspiration from these spectacular individuals who are sharing their personal stories of transformation so that others may see what is possible,"" said Dr. Mehmet Oz, M.D. ""While we made the contest as exciting as possible with a million dollar prize, the finalists that underwent the most impressive transformations weren't motivated by money, but rather a desire to reclaim their health and be around longer for their loved ones."" ""The Dr. Oz Show"" partnered with Weight Watchers-ranked #1 best plan for weight loss in 2011 and 2012 by U.S. News & World Report - to help registrants lose weight. Weight Watchers was an obvious choice for a weight loss program partner because of the scale and infrastructure of the organization. Anticipating sign ups exceeding one million participants, ""The Dr. Oz Show"" had to direct participants to an easy to find, easy to follow program that was also familiar, scientifically sound and medically respected. Dr. Oz's Transformation Nation: Million Dollar You was powered online by the show's partner, Sharecare, who is committed to getting America healthy. In addition to the Dr. Oz's Transformation Nation: Million Dollar You interactive program on Sharecare, participants have access to trusted health and wellness information, helpful tools, and real-time community interaction with each other and with thousands of health experts including physicians, nurses and trainers - all designed to help everyone live their healthiest life. Sharecare is a company founded and owned by Harpo, Sony Pictures Television, Discovery Communications, Dr. Oz, and Jeff Arnold, which also powers the robust website for ""The Dr. Oz Show."" Each step in the Dr. Oz's Transformation Nation: Million Dollar You program has its own curriculum and evaluation criteria - all of which is managed in the online program. A short synopsis of the seven steps that the ten finalists followed include: TELL A FRIEND: The show asked all Americans to enlist their friends because we know you cannot go at it alone. Studies show folks who lose weight in groups keep their weight off and are more successful in the long term. WEIGH IN WITH WEIGHT WATCHERS AND CALCULATE YOUR BMI:  Learn the importance of your Body Mass Index. If you don't have a healthy BMI, we asked participants to lose 10 percent loss of body weight or reach and maintain a healthy BMI, which correlates to a drop in risk to type 2 diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. The first step in calculating your BMI was to go to a local Weight Watchers center. There, participants found out their starting weight. During the initiative they received a complimentary weigh-in, and were invited to stay for a meeting. If they liked what they heard, they were invited to join Weight Watchers and become a member. CONNECT WITH YOUR DOCTOR:  Nearly 1/3 of all Americans don't see a doctor every year. We encouraged participants to start a relationship their doctor so they could have an honest conversation about their weight before it becomes a bigger problem. Know the questions to ask your doctor and find out the right numbers to talk with them about, including blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose. Having a relationship will help you prevent future illness. If participants didn't have a doctor, we encouraged them to seek out their pharmacist who could help get the conversation going. LEARN YOUR FAMILY'S HEALTH HISTORY:  One of the critical tools a doctor uses to diagnose illness and recommend preventative care is your family history. Knowing your family's health history enables you to get life saving screenings before it's too late. ""The Dr. Oz Show"" web site (www.doctoroz.com) offers unique web tools powered by Sharecare to help participants fill out their family history and compile all critical information. GET MORE SLEEP:  This step taught Americans to get at least 30 more minutes of sleep a night by going to bed a half-hour earlier. We know that lack of sleep is a hidden factor of weight gain. ASSESS YOUR STRESS:  Everyone must understand how stress is a key factor in weight gain, and learn new and practical ways to manage their stress better. Stress can affect the neuroendocrine system, resulting in abdominal fat, for example: indirectly stress is linked to the consumption of too many fatty or sugary foods and inactivity. START NEW FITNESS HABITS:  Something as simple as a brisk walking for 30-60 minutes, five times a week can lower your risk of heart disease by about 40 percent. The web site provided contestants with various fitness resources. DR. OZ'S TRANSFORMATION NATION: MILLION DOLLAR YOU CONTEST OFFICIAL RULES

Broccoli's EON Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, and Sony Pictures Entertainment's SPECTRE's astonishing global box office take is nearly $200 million this weekend.  After setting new box office opening records in nearly every country in which it opened last weekend, SPECTRE, the 24th James Bond adventure, opened wide around the world with stunning results from an additional 72 territories, including the United States, bringing the film's worldwide cume to $300 million in less than two weeks.

Internationally, the film is a blockbuster, as SPECTRE opened #1 in all 71 international territories in which it opened this weekend, taking in $117.8 million in total, with 40% of markets yet to come, including France, Australia, South Korea, Japan, and China. This weekend, SPECTRE outperformed in Skyfall in Mexico (where it took in $4.5 million, more than double the take of Skyfall, which released on a holiday), Brazil ($2.9 million), Russia ($5.8 million), Belgium ($2.4 million including previews), Austria ($2.6 million including previews), Hong Kong ($2.4 million), Malaysia ($2.3 million), Poland ($3.1 million), Portugal ($871K), Slovakia ($425K), and Bulgaria ($219K), and performed on par with Skyfall in Germany ($20.1M for the weekend, including previews and a new record for the biggest Saturday of all time), Italy ($5.7 million), Switzerland ($4.1 million including previews), Spain ($3.3 million), Taiwan ($2.6 million), and Singapore ($1.8 million).  The film is also holding extremely well in the six markets in which it opened last weekend.

Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, the producers of SPECTRE, added, ""We're astounded and thank all our fans worldwide for this incredible response to SPECTRE."" ABOUT ""SPECTRE""A cryptic message from the past sends James Bond (Daniel Craig) on a rogue mission to Mexico City and eventually Rome, where he meets Lucia Sciarra (Monica Bellucci), the beautiful and forbidden widow of an infamous criminal.  Bond infiltrates a secret meeting and uncovers the existence of the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE. Meanwhile back in London, Max Denbigh (Andrew Scott), the new head of the Centre for National Security, questions Bond's actions and challenges the relevance of MI6, led by M (Ralph Fiennes). Bond covertly enlists Moneypenny (Naomie Harris) and Q (Ben Whishaw) to help him seek out Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux), the daughter of his old nemesis Mr White (Jesper Christensen), who may hold the clue to untangling the web of SPECTRE. As the daughter of an assassin, she understands Bond in a way most others cannot. As Bond ventures towards the heart of SPECTRE, he learns of a chilling connection between himself and the enemy he seeks, played by Christoph Waltz.  Sam Mendes returns to direct SPECTRE, with Daniel Craig reprising his role as 007 for the fourth time. SPECTRE is produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli.

The audience is taken on a dramatic journey leading to the moment where one man's chance at ultimate redemption hangs in the balance.  While at first the Confessor appears to be an evil, cold-blooded killing machine and the Priest the ultimate arbiter of good, both characters push the boundaries of right and wrong.

Clark added, ""Spider-Man is beloved by audiences all over the world, so we wanted to launch the trailer in a truly global way. We have had great success launching trailers across Sony's diverse entertainment platform - and when you have a character like Spider-Man, it demands a broad, fun way to reach moviegoers internationally as well as domestically. Everyone at Sony is just as excited as we are to see the next chapter in the story of Peter Parker begin to unfold in this way."" We've always known that Spider-Man's most important battle has been within himself: the struggle between the ordinary obligations of Peter Parker and the extraordinary responsibilities of Spider-Man. But in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Peter Parker finds that a greater conflict lies ahead. It's great to be Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield). For Peter Parker, there's no feeling quite like swinging between skyscrapers, embracing being the hero, and spending time with Gwen (Emma Stone). But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: OsCorp. Directed by Marc Webb. Produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach. Screen Story and Screenplay by Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci & Jeff Pinkner. Based on the Marvel Comic Book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.

" CULVER CITY, Ca., - 24 September 2009 -  Sony Pictures Televisions' 2waytraffic, announced its MIPCOM slate for this year's market today. On offer is The Dating Game, one of the longest running formats in TV history, as well as Your Kid's An Idiot, which recently enjoyed a strong performing summer debut on BBC3 and is already starting pre-production on a second season. 2waytraffic is also selling Frenemies, a quiz show with a unique reality element. Commenting, Ed Louwerse, managing director, 2waytraffic International, Sony Pictures Television, said: ""The shows that we're offering illustrate our careful evaluation of the marketplace and reflect what buyers are looking for proven ratings winners like 'The Dating Game' and 'Your Kid's An Idiot,' and unique programming, which 'Frenemies,' a reality/quiz show hybrid, delivers."" Your Kid's An Idiot, known as Young, Dumb & Living Off Mum in the UK, has been a ratings winner this summer on BBC3. The show takes a bunch of spoiled teenagers and places them in a house together to survive without their mums' mollycoddling. Over a series of challenges and important life questions, the teenagers are judged by their parents from outside the house who decide each week which teenager is less likely to change their wayward ways and therefore who should leave the house. To date this show, which has averaged over half a million* viewers for the series, has been the most successful launch a factual series on BBC3 this year. The Dating Game has been attracting primetime audiences for more than 40 years. The premise is simple: one guy has to choose which of three girls he would like to go on a date with, then the roles reverse and a girl gets to ask questions of three guys. But the all new match-making show returns to TF1 on 28 September with several new twists including the chance for viewers to see the couple back stage have their first exchanges. In another dramatic twist, the couple returns to the set to reveal whether or not they wish to go on a date together, making those all important first impressions really count. Frenemies, a Ludus format, is a compelling new genre of game show which combines a tense on-location contestant meeting with an in-studio game, packed with extremes of kindness and meanness. This is no ordinary quiz show where knowledge alone will get you through. Before the game even kicks off, contestants attend a ""bonding dinner"" with their rivals which quickly reveals where friendships and conflicts have formed. When the game gets started, it's all about helping your new found friends or hampering the efforts of your enemies. The challenge is to cleverly play your cash and opponents to win and hold onto your cash.
