Recently Mark Cuban gave an ultimatum to the lawyers at ABC's Shark Tank: Either remove your equity clause or I'm not coming back, reports Jason Cochran. According to the clause, all contestants were required to give Finnmax, Shark Tank's production company, either 2 percent of their profits or 5 percent equity in their company. This rule applied regardless of the deal struck with investors, and all contestants since Season One were obliged to agree to it. However, last Sunday, Cuban, who went to court Monday over insider trading allegations, wrote on Facebook that the equity clause had been removed, thanks to him: ""FYI, there is no additional equity or percentage of anything taken any longer. That was removed retroactively,"" he told a group of former contestants. ""I told them I wouldn't come back this season if it wasn't."" ABC and Sony Pictures Television declined to comment. Cuban also wrote that if the clause stayed in place, the ""quality of the companies and entrepreneurs would decline."" The reason: Savvy entrepreneurs aren't willing to trade an automatic stake in their company for appearing on a show without a deal, says Ami Kassar, a New York Times financial columnist. Here, he explains the pitfalls of that arrangement (emphasis ours): ""Remember that when you're giving away equity, you're getting married to your investors. Make sure that your value and ideas are in synch. And keep in mind that if your company ever wants to borrow money in the future, it's likely that any investor who owns 20 percen",Private

The major points are: Increase in per episode fee to $30k for year five, $31,200 for year six, and $32,488 for year seven They also made significant changes to the agreement to further prevent you from exploiting various aspects from the show. More specifically, they have expanded the scope of the covenants regarding the use of such proprietary property. This could be in response to your marketing of merchandise that refers to Shark Tank, your catchphrases on the show etc (as shown on the Mark Cuban Store on the MarkCubanCompanies webpage. So effectively they want rights to your “catchphrases…nicknames, gestures, utterances, etc.” I would push back on this…but want to get your input first. Also, they are expanding the scope of the “work for hire” provision to now include not only ABC but also other networks were the show is broadcast (CNBC for example). Thus, your contractual commitments re: publicity, personal apperances and other promotional services now are being expanded beyond ABC but to all who license the show. Push back? They also changed the agreement to now have Sony be obligated to make royalty payments re: net merchandise receipts. The problem with this is that Sony is not a party to the agreement so we should modify to have 208 Productions guaranty the obligations and/or ask to add Sony to the agreement only re: this payment obligation.

Honey Boo Boo is old TV news. So make way for a new buzzword: Boo Boo Goo, the invention of another tyke who's about to hit the small screen. Kiowa Kavovit, 7, is the youngest inventor to dive into ABC's Shark Tank, which invites entrepreneurs to pitch a panel of potential investors — including maverick billionaire Mark Cuban — in the hopes they bite. Kavovit will appear in Friday's episode (9 p.m. ET/PT), dedicated entirely to child innovators. Her pitch: Kids, and maybe even adults, are tired of adhesive bandages and would much prefer to simply roll on a patent-pending translucent liquid compound that doesn't peel off until you do the honors. Boo Boo Goo comes in a range of colors — including, of course, pink. It's much prettier than a bandage,"" says Kavovit, who was 4 when she came up with the idea and 6 when she taped the show last year. She calls the experience of presenting to the ""sharks,"" along with her father, Andy, ""a little scary."" The results of Kavovit's presentation can't be spoiled here, but her pint-sized presence on the show, standing on a stool so she can be seen, makes the prospect of a new generation of American innovators loom large. Among the other kid inventors on the episode are a polished teenager who invented a bottle that infuses water with hints of fruit and an earnest beekeeper who hopes to rescue the family farm with his line of spicy honey. ""We're in our fifth season, and every year the number and quality of ideas improves and the number of younger applicants rises,"" says Clay Newbill, Shark Tank's executive producer. ""We hope that in five to 10 years, the next Mark Zuckerberg will say he or she got inspired by seeing the people on this show."" Newbill adds that it was Cuban who brought to his attention the program's influence on younger viewers. ""Mark told me that so many parents have come up to him saying that their kids insist on watching with them,"" he says. Nielsen says 11% of Shark Tank'saudience is under 25. Andy Kavovit thought a Tank appearance would offer his daughter's liquid-bandage idea the best shot at an injection of marketing buzz and the investment needed to further develop the company's patents. He and Kiowa asked the show's panelists for $100,000 in exchange for 17.5% of the company. ""There are other similar products out there, but most aren't aimed at the consumer market,"" he says. ""What we really wanted to gauge is whether the opportunity for it to grow was out there."" Kavovit, a former child actor who starred in the daytime soap As The World Turns, and his wife, Jennifer, are home-schooling Kiowa and her brother, Cash, 4, spending half the year in Los Angeles and the other half in Florida. Years ago, Kavovit got the tinkering bug; he says his latest invention is called LeaveUpLites, a system of exterior home LED lights that can be programmed to change colors with the holiday season. The couple hope their children grow up thinking outside the box when it comes to careers.

"NY Times: N.F.L. Stands by Its Push to Connect to Fans Digitally By KEN BELSONOctober 19. 2014 The N.F.L. media machine rolls on, Mark Cuban be damned. Earlier this year, Mr. Cuban, the maverick owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said that the N.F.L. was saturating the airwaves and the Internet and was in danger of crumbling in a decade. The league has shrugged off his criticism. Naysayers have made similar points in years past and been proved wrong. Despite grim news about domestic abuse, concussions and other issues that have embarrassed the league, television ratings for N.F.L. games have risen, not dipped, this season. Besides, there is money to be made. This month, the N.F.L. renewed its rights deal with DirecTV, which will pay an average of $1.5 billion a year from 2015 to 2022 to continue carrying the NFL Sunday Ticket package of out-of-market games, a 50 percent jump compared with the current deal, which expires this season. Forever thirsty, the N.F.L. has also pushed further into the next frontier, mobile video. In August, the league unveiled NFL Now, which provides game highlights, fantasy updates, news and classic footage to tablets, smartphones and Xbox One game consoles. The content is free, though users can pay $1.99 monthly to skip some advertisements. “Our view is we know that’s where the world is going, so we made sure we had the property rights to populate a new video service,” said Brian Rolapp, executive vice president for media for the N.F.L. “This is our direct way to talk to fans and for fans to talk to us.” The league said NFL Now had been visited more than nine million times since its launch in August, but declined to say whether that was more or less than it had expected. The league also did not say how much time visitors had spent on NFL Now. According to the league, people with wireless devices like tablets and smartphones have made up 55 percent of the visits to NFL Now, while those using connected devices like the Xbox have consumed 45 percent of the minutes spent on the service. Fans using NFL Now with connected devices watch nearly twice the number of videos and spend three times as much time per visit as those who access the service from wireless devices, the league said. That suggests that fans on wired devices are spending more time digging into NFL Now’s library of documentaries, shows and other long-form content than those using wireless devices. “It’s a bit of blend,” said Perkins Miller, the league’s chief digital officer. “On Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays, people use NFL Now as a second screen. On Tuesdays through Fridays, people are flipping over to Apple TV and Xbox for long-form content.” However they watch, NFL Now raises compelling questions about the league’s push to provide content directly to fans and compete with the television networks and cable and satellite providers that pay the league billions of dollars in rights fees. NFL Now reuses highlights of games broadcast by CBS, Fox and other networks as well as news conferences and interviews produced by the 32 teams and the more than 100 million feet of film in the NFL Films library. “There’s a careful balancing act that is necessary,” said Ed Desser, a former N.B.A. executive who is a sports media consultant. “On the one hand, leagues have been exceptionally successful about getting guaranteed rights fees. On the flip side, the leagues create more content than all the Hollywood studios combined. The trick is not to siphon too much value out of the pot being purchased by your rights holders.” While NFL Now is aimed at hard-core fans and fantasy football players, the league has tried to include something for everyone. The service includes news updates, game highlights and “Can’t-Miss” play compilations. Fans with more time can view episodes of “A Football Life” or “Hard Knocks,” or documentaries on Super Bowl champion teams. The service also includes exclusive reality shows like “Finding Giants,” which follows the scouting department of the Giants. NFL Now can also be personalized so fans will be fed videos of their favorite teams. Whether the service will make money is a separate question. The N.F.L. declined to say how many fans had chosen to pay $1.99 a month for the premium version. But Jonathan Kraft, the son of the New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and co-chairman of the league’s digital media committee, said NFL Now would be “self-sustaining very quickly,” partly because it is produced at the NFL Network studios in Los Angeles, a move that has helped keep costs down. The longer-term benefits of NFL Now are just emerging. In time, the N.F.L. could use the service to distribute live programming or lure fantasy football fans away from ESPN or Yahoo Sports. And because users can customize NFL Now, the league can learn what users like and sell advertisements that target their interests. “You have to experiment and see what the audience embraces,” Mr. Desser said. “Anything that enhances the experience of N.F.L. football is good for your brand.”ESPN: Ray Rice appeal hearing scheduled October 21, 2014 The hearing on Ray Rice's appeal of his indefinite suspension from the NFL will be heard Nov. 5-6, according to ESPN and media reports. NBC News was the first to report the dates. A decision on whether NFL commissioner Roger Goodell will testify at the hearing is expected this week. The NFLPA is appealing Rice's suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy. The former Baltimore Ravens running back was suspended after video of him hitting his then-fiancee in an elevator was made public. If Rice's suspension is overturned and he is signed by another team, it is conceivable he could return to the league this season. Former U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones was chosen as the neutral arbitrator in the case. It is Jones who will decide whether or not Goodell testifies, a decision he left up to her. Union officials said in announcing the appeal that Goodell and his staff's testimony is a central reason it pushed to jointly select an outside arbiter. Goodell said in appointing Jones that she would have ""our full cooperation as she hears and decides this appeal.'' Jones is a partner in a private law firm and is also a former Department of Justice attorney. One month after Rice was initially suspended two games, Goodell said he didn't get things right and announced tougher penalties for future domestic violence incidents. Those penalties, however, didn't apply to Rice. Once the video was released, the Ravens cut Rice and the league banned him indefinitely, with the league saying it considered the video new evidence.

The network was expected to announce, as soon as Friday, that it would add a companion show to the hit series about successful businesspeople, called “sharks,” competing to invest in the businesses of aspiring entrepreneurs. The new show, “Beyond the Tank,” will trace the next stage of a start-up in which its product tries to find its way to market — and either succeeds or flops. Like “Shark Tank,” “Beyond the Tank” will be produced by Sony Pictures Television. On Thursday, the deal with ABC was in the final stages, one executive involved in it said. No date has been set for the new show’s debut, but it will most likely make it onto ABC’s schedule sometime in the coming television season. “Beyond the Tank” has Mark Burnett, the most successful reality TV producer of the last decade, as an executive producer. His company, One Three Media, will co-produce it with Sony. “This show is exactly what ‘Shark Tank’ fans have been asking: Tell me what happens when they walk out of the tank,” Mr. Burnett said in an email. Zack Van Amburg, president of programming for Sony, said he could not comment yet on the new series because a deal had not been completed. But he noted that the original “Shark Tank” would celebrate its 100th episode on Friday. He also cited the popularity of the show, which averaged 7.2 million viewers last season and generally topped all shows on Fridays among viewers preferred by many advertisers — those between 18 and 49. The “Shark Tank” format, which originated in Japan, where it was called “Dragon’s Den,” has become popular around the world. Versions have appeared in countries ranging from Germany to Saudi Arabia. “Shark Tank” repeats are by far the most successful program on the cable network CNBC, where they average 490,000 viewers. All this for a show that, Mr. Van Amburg said, was repeatedly turned down when Sony tried to sell it years ago, even by ABC — three times — before the network stepped up and bought it.

XBox 360′s Connect and iOS’s Siri introduced a wide array of consumers to voice control for media and communications. Google’s latest TV ad campaign embedded to the right is based around using Android’s built-in voice navigation, with the iconic “Okay Google” command. Amazon’s FireTV most exciting feature was its incredibly accurate and fast, voice-driven cross-app search and discovery feature (see our demo from April 3rd, click here). While we believe voice-control will be extremely important in the car, given safety/legal issues, the question becomes how useful will it be in your everyday, on-the-go life and within your home media/entertainment/communication lives?

"FW: MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference Steve Tsai would like to go to this conference. It’s a show about how the Sports Industry is using big data and analytics to predict performance. This is related to the work we are doing with Jitesh and Jay for Steven. Do we have the budget to send Steve to this—total budget would be for him approx. $2k (flight, hotel, admission, meals, taxi, etc.). I also think this might be very interesting so I might want to attend with him if you can approve $4k. If not, then just Steve. Please let me know. Scott From: Tsai, Steven Sent: Tuesday, January 14, 2014 6:27 PM To: Sherr, Scott Subject: MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference Here’s the logline on the conference: MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference The conference goal is to provide a forum for industry professionals (executives and leading researchers) and students to discuss the increasing role of analytics in the global sports industry. MIT Sloan is dedicated to fostering growth and innovation in this arena, and the conference enriches opportunities for learning about the sports business world. The conference is open to anyone interested in sports. Founded in 2006, the conference is co-chaired by Daryl Morey (MIT Sloan ’00) and Jessica Gelman (HBS ’02) who oversee MIT Sloan students in the planning and operating of the yearly conference. More info on the website: http://www.sloansportsconference.com/ Cost of the conference is ~$600 plus flights and hotel in Boston. Date is February 29-March 1st. There’s been a big push in the sports industry to quantify performance, which could be applicable to our business. Conference is driven by Daryl Morey, the GM of the Houston Rockets, and they had Nate Silver and Michael Lewis last year. Here’s a summary on the 2013 session: The 7th annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference was held from March 1-2, 2013 at the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center (BCEC). Attendance grew by over 25% from 2012 to more than 2,700 guests and featured 125 panelists across 30 panels. Featured panelists included: Michael Lewis, Mark Cuban, Nate Silver, RC Buford, Brian Burke, Jack Del Rio, Herm Edwards, Stan Kasten, Jonathan Kraft, Andrea Kremer, Jackie MacMullan, Steve Pagliuca, Bill Polian, Adam Silver, John Skipper, and Stan Van Gundy. The conference featured multiple panels running simultaneously and covered a range of topics across sports and the business of sports. Featured panels included “Revenge of the Nerds,” which covered the rise of probabilistic thinking using objective data in decision making across all disciplines, “The Changing Nature of Ownership” highlighting the challenges and opportunities for todays’ owners and their various partners, and “It’s Not You, It’s Me,” which discussed whether or not coaches get fired with too great a frequency, and what the data tells us about how these breakups impact performance. The theme of the 2013 conference was “Going Back to the Data.” Specifically, the conference explored how today’s thought leaders have found more meaningful ways to analyze, visualize and prioritize data to improve decision making. The discussion examined the influence of big data, the rise of technology, and the evolving competitive advantage analytics provides. The conference continued to emphasize and promote innovation in the sports industry through conference staples such as the research paper competition and Evolution of Sport (EoS) series. Each was again a featured part of the conference, drawing packed audiences across the two days. In the research paper category, “The Value of Flexibility in Baseball Roster Construction” by Timothy Chan and Douglas Fearing took home first prize, while “The Automated Prospect Model” by Adam Guttridge was selected as the best EoS presentation. Opportunities for students and start-ups to share their ideas remained a focus with the third annual “First Pitch” business case competition sponsored by MLBAM. In a similar forum, the second annual Trade Show Blitz Competition provided space for exploring new, unique ideas in sports analytics from start-up companies. Finally, our second Lifetime Achievement Alpha Award winner was Bill Belichick, Head Coach of the New England Patriots. He accepted the honor via video and the video promptly went viral. The conference’s impact on the sports industry continued to grow with over 100 media mentions over the two-day conference, including articles from Bloomberg, Forbes, The New York Times, and Sports Illustrated. Additionally, the conference trended #3 nationally on Twitter and in the top 5 internationally, with 22,000 #ssac or #ssac13 tweets posted throughout the conference.

"Fury Hello, My name is SSG David Horton. I am currently in the Army and deployed in support of Multinational Forces and Observers in Egypt. This deployment is unique than others that we have been into the last 13 years. I am in 4th Squadron 3d Cavalry Regiment based out of Fort Hood TX. For many of the Trooper’s here this is their first deployment. The movie “Fury” looks to be an awesome movie. I know the movie does not arrive to movie theaters until Nov 2014 in the US. I am wondering If you could be of some assistance. I am trying to see if we could obtain a premier copy of this movie. This movie would boost our moral here as we get movies and they are rather old.

Unauthorized recordings will be reported to law enforcement and may subject you to criminal and civil liability.Security Pre-Screening Protocols PRE-SCREENING SECURITY All THE EQUALIZER pre-release footagescreenings and pre-release screenings shall have the following security protocols. THE EQUALIZER is far too important to Sony Pictures not to protect it to the fullest extent. PRE-RELEASE SCREENING SECURITY PROTOCOLS All invitees must be advised in advance that NO mobile phones, cameras or recording devices will be allowed inside the theatre. The invitation must have language to this effect in both thelocal language and in English. Please also ask your guests to arrive early as this process could slow things slightly. NOTE: security vendors selected to provide security coverage at each theatre must be adequately prepared and staffed to facilitate this both courteously and efficiently. Prior to theatre entry metal detection devices (hand-held wands) will be used by trained security personnel to screen all attendees to ensure they do not enter with prohibited items. A sufficient number of these wands should be available to ensure all guests are screened within one hour leading up to the start of the film. At each theatre entrance there should be an area designated to perform wanding of guests with handheld metal detectors and to allow for the check-in of recording devices and all phones. Security staff should walk through all areas of the theatre (including bathrooms) and the projection booth in each auditorium prior to and during the screening of the film - ideally, one member of staff should remain in the projection booth area while the assembled film is there. Theatre management should be advised of these security protocols and understand and support them. FOR THE RUN THROUGHS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE SECURE THE AUDITORIUMS AND PROJECTION BOOTHS. Although package inspection is mandatory there should be no physical contact between the screener and the guest or the guests' belongings (unless and until they are checking in a camera or a mobile phone). Security is responsible for ensuring that no unauthorized persons enter the theatre after the film begins and further to re- inspect all items/persons upon their re-entry to the theatre. Security staff will patrol the theatre and utilize night vision goggles (NVG) to ensure no one is operating a recording device. The size of the audience and the lay-out of the auditorium will determine the number of scopes needed. In the event someone is observed orsuspected of recording the film a member of the SPRI staff will be responsible for responding. Unless there are extraordinary circumstances it is preferred that the screening not be interrupted and that the suspect be approached just as the film ends. This will obviously require continual visual monitoring until movie ends. The local contract security vendor for each venue should provide enough two-way radios to ensure their staff and ours are well connected. POST SCREENING PROTOCOLS/OTHER Upon completion of the screening, each print should be broken down, recovered and properly secured.

New reactions are in bold. Tom O'Neil/GOLD DERBY Tom had a very positive reaction, saying, “absolutely LOVED IT – wow. The film is not only expertly made, but it has a high Rooting Factor, which is important for Oscars, of course."" Steve Pond/THE WRAPHe's busy in meetings all day and said he's unable to say much, but so far shared the following reaction: “I think it's good.” David Cohen/VARIETYDavid said, “I am still digesting the film. My feelings are mostly positive, but complicated. Very glad I saw it.” Perri Nemiroff/COLLIDER.COMPerri liked the film a lot. She thought that it was much grimmer than she was expecting, but she was still really into it. She really took to the characters, was blown away by how visceral the action is and couldn't believe the film was over two hours long. It really flew by! She said that she would totally see the movie again. Alex Billington/FIRSTSHOWING.NETAlex LOVED it. He loved everything about it - the score, the action, the story, the performances, so awesome. He said that it was his kind of movie. The movie had everything he wanted and much more. Kristy Puchko/CINEMABLEND.COMKristy found the movie to be gripping and suitably gruesome! She said that she thought that the performances are stellar, though at times disturbing! Zade Constantine/THE FILM STAGEZade thought the film had good performances and some well structured sequences. However, he found the tone and characters to be unsympathetic and alienating at times. Rebecca Keegan/LOS ANGELES TIMESRebecca said she loved it. She noted she especially loved the battle scenes, and Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman's chemistry. She said the final sequence is “a heart pounder.” Michael Thurston/AFPMichael said FURY was exactly what he expected and he very much enjoyed it. He shared how his colleague had mentioned his expectation of the film being similar to Inglorious Bastards due to the similar theme; however after watching FURY Michael doesn't think the films compare. He thought that FURY surpassed the typical war film and was action packed from beginning to end. Though it is not typical in war films, he would of liked to have seen some humorous scenes or lines. Ashley Williams/TV ONEAshley loved the movie, saying it was one of the best of the year. She said: “Brotherhood and camaraderie executed to perfection. Most intense movie of the year.” Claudia Cano/TELEMUNDO.COMClaudia thought the film was full of evocative real life performances. She commented that it was a ""very real tale of the horrors of war. A bit long, but great story telling.” Jamaal Finkley/BLACKTREE.TVJamaal thought the film was one to be treasured, stating that it was a “classic coming of age story of camaraderie and trust.” Antonio Martin/EFEAntonio truly enjoyed and was overall impressed with the film. On a grading scale, he would give the film a B+. Antonio thought the film comes with a great supporting cast and because of this he would of liked to know more about each characters' personal life. He thought the lack of character development did not hurt the film but it could have enhanced it. He thought the standout of the film was Shia LaBeouf. Josep Parera/LA OPINIONJosep thought the movie was great! He shared how this is the first ""award movie"" of the season and he was not disappointed. He thought the movie was a perfect combination of classic and modern war cinema containing the right balance of grittiness and entertainment for the genre. Josep thought the movie was well cast and that alongside Brad Pitt (which is a given) Logan Lerman imposes himself as a star in the film. He mentioned how he thinks having a Latino serves only for marketing purposes however Michael did do a good job. Lastly, Josep complemented the score, saying that the music played an essential role in setting the mood especially for the dramatic scenes. Bill Goodykoontz/ARIZONA REPUBLICBill thought the film was likeable, but predictable. He said the violence was very graphic, but it didn’t bother him as much because it was done artfully and was important to the plot. Bill also commented that the acting by all leads was great. Gary Thompson/PHILADELPHIA DAILY NEWS Gary is a huge David Ayer fan and likes his kind of pulpy, expressionist style. When applied to a WWII movie, it reminded him very much of Sam Fuller, i.e, The Big Red One. He truly enjoyed the film. Oscar Petit/EL GORDO Y LA FLACA/UNIVISION Oscar thought the film very well done and believable, commenting that he was specifically impacted by the war scenes, and loved that Brad Pitt was believable throughout. Marc Mohan/THE OREGONIAN Marc thought that it was trying to be two movies: a gritty anti-war story, emphasizing the horrible parts about war that we often don’t see in typical Hollywood fare. At the same time, a gung-ho exciting war movie full of faced paced action. He felt that the film ended up feeling somewhat awkward in its message. He described it as “depressing as heck” but assumed that was the intention. Overall, he said there were many good elements, but they seemed in conflict at times. Carlos McConnie/UNIVISION.COMCarlos enjoyed the film overall and said that it’s definitely a war worth watching and something generations to come should educate themselves on. Bob Thompson/POSTMEDIA/BFCA MEMBERBob thought the film is harrowing yet a compelling story defining the brutality of war. He said the ensemble performances are great and David Ayer does an excellent job at creating the war scenes than look realistic. Gabriel de Lerma/EL NUEVO HERALDGabriel really enjoyed the film. He thought the film was very well cast and thought it is always a joy to see Brad, he was quiet impressed with the ""younger"" talent. He emphasized Logan Lerman's character and how glad. He also was that he survived. Gabriel also mentioned there wasn't anything in particular he didn't like however he did find it hard to believe that the troop could survive that long. Nonetheless, he understands that it is Hollywood. Gabriel concluded by saying that he definitely foresees a couple of award nominations. Sonia Sarfati/LA PRESSESonia enjoyed the scenes from inside the tank as that was something she has not seen before done in film, but said the film was fine and not as exceptional as she had hoped. However, she thought the ensemble cast did a great job especially Logan Lerman, who’s performance she said was outstanding. Steve Weintraub/COLLIDER.COMSteve thought that Fury was very intense. He said that there was literally not one wasted second on screen. He said that he could predict what was going to happen in some scenes and that he was still on the edge of his seat the entire time. He thought it was very well done. Bruce Kirkland/TORONTO SUNBruce said it was a very good film. He said it’s realistic and that it does an excellent job in showing how life would have been like to the men fighting in tanks. Bruce whimsically referenced “Das Boot” and praised “Fury” as another example of great filmmaking in cramped quarters. He especially liked the fact that there were no heroes in the story. He also said the cast was strong, and that Pitt’s performance is exceptionally strong because it’s so authentic. He likened the film and the cast to “Band of Brothers”. Bruce said there is nothing he has to criticize about the film with the exception of the music, which he thought was weak. Andrew Dansby/HOUSTON CHRONICLEAndrew said he was impressed, particularly with the way David Ayer conveyed the physical aspect of war debt, which tended to be more common in Vietnam films than World War II. He said the film was nicely conveyed with a sense of brutality & disconnect while hinting at post traumatic stress disorder. He said the film is not easy to watch, but it is moving. Marc Mohan/THE OREGONIAN Marc’s reaction to the film was mixed/positive. He thought that it was trying to be two movies: a gritty anti-war story, emphasizing the horrible parts about war that we often don’t see in typical Hollywood fare. At the same time, a gung-ho exciting war movie full of faced paced action. He felt that the film ended up feeling somewhat awkward in its message. He described it as “depressing as heck” but assumed that, that was the intention. Overall, he said there were many good elements but they seemed in conflict at times. He is very interested in speaking with David Ayer about the film and I get the sense that talking over these thoughts with the director would be beneficial. Steve “Capone” Prokopy/AIN’T IT COOL NEWS Steve enjoyed the film very much. He thought it was very authentic yet brutal. He said that the acting was superb and notes that it was one of the better films he’s seen so far this year. He also noted that the dialogue between Brad Pit and Logan Lerman’s characters towards the end was raw and sincere.. “it brought the film together.” Clint O’Connor/THE PLAIN DEALER “Wow.” ""Fury"" is incredibly intense. Watching it is a very emotional experience. I was a big fan of David Ayer's ""End of Watch,"" which never really caught on in theaters for some reason. He is a master of hard-core realism. ""Fury"" grabs you by the chest and demands your attention. It is very well-made and very well-acted. There isn't much time to contemplate the horrors of warfare because they are splattering all around you. With the macro of a world war raging, it is the micro that grabs us: the one-on-one human relationships.” Jeff Simon/BUFFALO NEWS “Very effective! A brutal, honest war movie that you really don’t see anymore! Very unusual to see that type of brutal movie these days! Something you don’t expect!” Zac Shull/BALLERSTATUS.COMZac loved FURY, calling it one of the most realistic war movies he has ever seen. He felt that David Ayer perfectly balanced the film with elements of both humor and drama. He noted that at times FURY felt like a horror movie in the way that it drew him in and kept him on bated breath. Zac thought that all of the characters were very well rounded and distinct with their own unique personalities and thought that director David Ayer did a great job of creating individuals who seemed haphazardly thrown together to create a rag-tag team of soldiers. Lastly, Zac thought that the cinematography was amazing, specifically the ""gritty"" imagery in the final battle scene. Kam Williams/KAM WILLIAMS SYNDICATE Kam Williams absolutely loved FURY and thought David Ayer’s directorial vision was ""ethereal."" He noted it felt like a cross between Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, He thought the story was gripping and held his attention from start to finish. Every aspect of FURY made him feel as if he was in the tank with the crew, only further enhancing the tension amongst War Daddy and his men. Kam thoroughly enjoyed the development of each soldier, saying that he felt the individual characters were very well defined without being stereotypical. He praised Jon Bernthal for playing Grady Travis as the unlikeable jerk. Regarding the cast in its entirety, he felt that they were completely believable as the fictional character they portrayed on screen. While he was sad that the crew died, he felt that Logan Lerman's escape did leave him with a glimmer of hope. Overall, Kam felt that FURY was an unpredictable, epic war film that was ""tremendously done."" Ann Hornaday/WASHINGTON POSTAnn left the theater feeling the intensity of the film. She felt it is an interesting portrait of the war from such a different perspectives. She noted there are many substantial scenes and concepts to address in her interview with David Ayer and the cast. She’s really looking forward to the conversation in DC. Steven Rea/PHILADELPHIA INQUIRERSteven thought FURY was a visceral, gripping WWII drama. He thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through, noting he especially like that it showed the darker side, the dread, the dirt. He though Brad Pitt did an excellent job, and thought Logan Lerman as the green recruit was great. Steven said, in both FURY and END OF WATCH, David Ayer has shown a real skill for putting the viewer right there in the thick of things and makes the audience feel a part of the action. Jeff Wells/HOLLYWOOD ELSEWHEREJeff said that the film is, ""Filled with a good amount of exciting, jolting verisimilitude. Otherwise forget it."" ""It's good, it's not great. It's strong when it's strong, but otherwise it's....weird?"" He did not care for the extended domestic sequence with the two German women, which he thought went on too long. Jeff said he felt like the ""Wild Bunch finale"" didn't make sense to him because in his words, ""they weren't trapped, they could have run for the trees,"" but chose not to. He said it was a case of Nihilism, pure and simple. ""Fury is very strong in some respects -- great battle verisimilitude -- but ultimately thought it was too nihilistic.” Kris Tapley/HITFIXKris said “I kind of loved a lot of it. It feels like he bit off more than he could chew but it's fascinating watching all the ideas bounce around. That scene with the German girls is kind of amazing. Reminded me of the French plantation sequence in ‘Apocalypse Now Redux.’ I wonder about Oscars. I'm not squeamish about this stuff, strangely (as in war trauma in movies), but even I thought it probably leaned too heavily on that. After a while it's sort of numbing. That could be difficult with that crowd. Opening scene is really awesome intro to the crew. I've heard of a bunch of stuff that they took out of the movie but it sounds like they stripped away exactly what they needed to. I dug it.” Greg Ellwood/HITFIXGreg enjoyed the action scenes in the movie, but thought the script was lacking. He though that Brad made the most of his role and gave a great performance with a character that wasn’t deeply written. He thought the DP, sound and production designers all could get nominations. He felt Logan Lerman had a shot for Best Supporting Actor. David Poland/MOVIE CITY NEWSDavid said he cannot stop thinking about Fury. He said, “this movie is so incredibly current. It's about so many things that resonate right now and the best war movie in 30 years that's really about war. He can’t wait to see it again. He added, “the Oscar race is now on. There is finally a best picture. A REAL movie. Why have you been hiding this film, it's ridiculously amazing. It is better than any of the other movies I thought were the best picture (Birdman, Boyhood and definitely better than Gone Girl or the films from Toronto).I think the narrative that all the press is hoping will play out — could. If Angelina's movie lives up to the hype, it could be Brad against Angie.” Michael Cieply/THE NEW YORK TIMES“Fury is every bit as good as I figured it would be. Very tough, but really good. Best part is, my wife liked it, and she's a much tougher audience for this one. I'm pulling together a kind of reported essay on the three looming World War II movies, Fury, The Imitation Game, and Unbroken. Nothing elaborate; just trying to explain that they all have radically different takes on what prevailed: Guts, brains, spirit. Fury is guts in this equation. “ Ethan Alter/FILM JOURNALEthan said that overall he would give the film a B. He said he was mixed on the film when it comes to the story, but he thought that the visuals were quite striking. He thought the action sequences--particularly that one tank battle with the three American tanks against the one German tank--were very well executed and that David Ayer did a nice job capturing the inside-the-tank dynamics amongst the five men. Of the cast, Jon Bernthal struck him as a key standout. He did feel that the narrative dragged at times. Neil Goldman/CHARLIE ROSENeil enjoyed the film, but he did have some criticisms to share. He feels the camera shots are interesting and at 2 hours 15 minutes, the movie moves. He said the acting is great and that Jon Bernthal steals the show. Neil feels that even though the explosions get repetitive, Brad Pitt holds the film together and the film feels authentic. Two scenes that Neil thinks are incredibly gripping are Norman resisting Brad Pitt's order to kill the German officer and Norman and Brad Pitt's dinner with the German women and their drunken American tank mates crashing the meal. Neil thinks some of the shots in the movie are beautiful like “the men draped over the tank coming at us with the backdrop of a barren landscape; the neon light show of artillery fire, etc.” He said that you definitely get a sense of the camaraderie of tankers…”the banter, the horseplay, the claustrophobia, the differences of opinion and belief that bump up against each other because four men are housed so tightly together, the anger/resentment, (Norman & Brad Pitt's early beef, Norman's fighting with Jon Bernthal's character), but also the love that exists between them.” Neil is questioning what the movie is ultimately about and feels that none of the themes are fully explored. He didn't find it to be a particularly smart movie or leave much to talk about afterwards. Further, Neil thought it was unrealistic that the SS guard would allow one of them to get away at the end of the movie. But ultimately, Neil said FURY is not a bad way to spend 2 hrs 15 minutes if you're looking for some entertainment.” Lynn Hirschberg/WLynn liked the film, but wasn’t blown away by it. She said it was quite an experience and an exhausting film. Ultimately, she commented that it is really an oppressive anti-war film and by the end you end up asking “Why, why, why” which is very powerful. Brad Pitt is the best thing in the film and its heart and soul – if you take him out there would be a problem. He took what is on the page and really made it meaningful, it is clearly a very deep and personal performance and it is unlike anything he has done in previous roles – Wardaddy is a lost soul. He could get a nomination even in such a crowded year for actors. The other cast was good, though they weren’t given enough to do. It really is Brad Pitt’s show. Logan Lerman was better than he usually is in a somewhat clichéd character. Shia LaBeouf was very good. Lynn wished that there was some more back story to the characters. John Anderson/NEWSDAYJohn thought the film was fantastic and said he thinks Brad Pitt could get a nomination though it will be tough given how crowded the actor field is this year. He also said that he “wouldn’t be surprised if the film could be considered quite controversial given that virtually everyone is psychotic, the war-glory BS is completely debunked and the close to rape sequence is like nothing I’ve seen in American film.” Missy Schwartz/ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLYMissy liked the film a lot, though she did feel it was a hard movie to figure out (clearly, David Ayer is saying a lot). Everyone was really good and Brad Pitt was excellent. She really believed him as Wardaddy. Shia LaBeouf was terrific. Unfortunately, she found the pivotal role of Norman underwritten and she was not totally onboard with him. Though important, she felt the apartment scene was a bit long. It is always challenging to make a film which is almost all battle sequences but she believed everything in FURY – all the guys were in it for the long haul, how fast transform in war the do or die mentality. As an audience, people are so trained to have some sort of happy ending and Missy said the film works so well because by the end it is truly devastating with everyone dying, really showing the trials and tribulation of war. The exhaustion of the characters which wears down on the soul is felt by the audience and is very effective. Rich Turner/WALL STREET JOURNALRich liked the film and thinks it will do quite well. Michael Arbeiter/NY DAILY NEWSMichael liked the film and thought the dynamic of the five guys was especially impressive. Samantha Miller/PEOPLESamantha liked the film and commented that the acting across the board was excellent. She said it is very well-made and all the action was very clear and visceral. She thought the film was intense and she liked the Howard Hawks/Sam Peckinpah male bonding vibe. She didn’t care for the score. Kara Warner/FREELANCE/SCREENRANT.COM/PLAYBOY.COMKara thought there is a LOT of great in the movie - the visuals, the tanks, the battle sequences, the acting - all of those elements are so satisfying. She said the one thing she couldn’t wrap her head around is the story. She said it almost pulls you in enough to fall in love with the guys and their tank family, but just doesn't quite get there. She commented it is beautifully shot and acted. Krista Smith/ VANITY FAIR (additional reaction)Krista thought it was so great to see Brad Pitt carry a movie again. She thought his performance was fantastic. She said that ironically for her, the freshness from the film was Shia LaBeouf. He is the heart of the movie. She liked that God was his justification for what they’re doing. She found that part fascinating, where she wanted to see more of that from the other characters. She would have been fine with 10 or 15 more minutes added to the movie if it allowed her to become better acquainted with each character. She loved the action and the realness of the film; however, she felt the script was lacking and there wasn’t much freshness to it. For instance, she didn’t understand the “Best Job I ever had” line. While she thought Logan Lerman’s character was phenomenal, she felt that Jon Bernthal’s character was reduced to a caricature and that Michael Pen’s character felt too modern. She thought that perhaps it was the dialogue written for him, but it didn’t feel like he was from 1945. As for the ending scene, she found it rather unbelievable. While the film felt so realistic throughout its entirety, she thought that Norman should have either been killed by the German soldier or had the savvy to survive. For her, it seemed unrealistic that the German soldier was willing to spare Norman’s life after he and the four other guys mauled down almost 300 Nazis. All-in-all, she thinks the movie will do very well commercially because it’s Brad Pitt. Currently, she is undecided on a best picture nomination.. she can’t completely rule it out. For Golden Globes, she thinks Brad Pitt and the film will definitely receive nominations. She would give the film a solid B+. Krista really liked the movie. She said she “wanted more of it.” Not more of the violence, but more of the story. She thought that Shia LaBeouf’s performance was fantastic. She did think Brad Pitt was great and really liked the scene in the apartment with the girls. Elena Howe/ LA TIMESElena said she liked the film a lot. However, she said it wasn’t quite as unique of a story as she had expected. She did say it was gripping and well acted. She thinks the film is worthy of some Oscar campaigning but didn’t elaborate any further. Elena added: “I think Logan Lerman in supporting for sure, Brad Pitt for lead… picture and director might be worthwhile as well given that there’s no clear frontrunner yet.” Jane Sarkin / VANITY FAIRJane loved the film and Brad Pitt. She said all of the performances are perfect and Logan Lerman is a revelation. The battle scenes are long and intense which are very important yet unpleasant. Lisa Hintelmann / ESQUIREAlthough this is not Lisa’s favorite genre, she did like the film and thought that Brad Pitt was terrific – it is a very complex character and he does an incredible job showing all of the varying traits: he is both brutal and tender at the same time; a father figure of sorts but not in an overbearing or clichéd way. Though she liked the supporting performances none of them stood out for her. The film is very well done and David Ayer does a great job at making a very intimate film about a very big thing and it works very well. The battle scenes are extremely visceral bringing the audience right to the frontlines of the war. She said the strongest scene is the apartment scene and she loved Alicia von Rittberg as Emma saying she reminded her of Abbie Cornish and Lea Seydoux. Lisa is a huge fan of End of Watch and how real and deep the relationship between Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhaal is and hoped to see that in Fury. Unfortunately, though they speak of it throughout the film, she never truly got the feeling of camaraderie between the guys in the tank and she had hoped to. Andrea Oliveri / DETAILSAndrea liked FURY and felt that it was a solid B+/A-. In addition to the performances, the cinematography, editing and effects were all top notch. She thought though the beginning was a bit slow, the story was strong and really picked up once Logan’s character was introduced. She said at first it seemed like a varied mix with the supporting actors, but she felt they all worked really well together which cements the fact that Brad Pitt is an amazing actor. Andrea commented that Shia LaBeouf is immensely talented and she LOVED Jon Bernthal. She also felt that Logan Lerman has such a great range and was extremely believable. Logan Lerman’s first shooting scene was a favorite as was Shia LaBeouf praying with the dying soldier. She loved the scene with the women in the German house – you really understood Wardaddy’s role in the story and how protective he was of Norman. She felt the tension was great when the rest of the squad came in drunk. All of the relationships in the film are complicated and interesting especially the brotherly bond between Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena and Shia LaBeouf -- and Brad Pitt definitely inhabited the role of Wardaddy. Andrea loved that he looked older and weathered which made him even more believable in the role. Kathy Heintzelman / FREELANCEKathy said she would count herself as a David Ayer fan – she really liked End of Watch. She thought Fury was well done, overall but it wasn't her favorite film this year. She would give the film a B. She said got very mixed messages from it -- and maybe that's realistic and commendable, but it felt a little manipulative to her. For example, a lot of it sends the ""war is hell"" message, but by the final standoff, with the swelling music, it seemed like this was the greatest job and the greatest camaraderie these guys were ever going to have (they even say as much). “Maybe that's the way battle really is, I don't know; or maybe that's the way it felt to the Greatest Generation in a war where there was a much clearer sense of good and evil.” But she thought it undercut the moral dilemmas the young newbie was wrestling with in the first half of the film. To her there were two standout sequences -- the one where the two tanks are battling each other, and the one in the house in the German town with the two women. In the tank sequence, she was really engaged with the mechanics of the battle in ways she wasn't during the final sequence. And the German town scene was just... weird in an interesting way. She couldn't quite buy that the other guys from the tank would be that harassing when their chief was clearly upset by their behavior. Or why he didn't just tell them to knock it off. Kathy didn't understand the dynamics there, but it was interesting and a nice break from battle scenes. The way the gunshots were indicated with colored laser-like bursts distracted her-- she felt it seemed cartoonish or video-game-ish. Kathy did mention for all she knows that's the way it really looks on the battlefield, but again, it sent a kind of mixed message. Kathy liked the acting although thought the characters were sort of stock. What happened with the newbie seemed obvious from the beginning -- if he didn't die early on he'd end up the way he did. And, it was hard to forget that that was Brad Pitt -- no fault of his acting, but he was a figurehead or symbol more than an actual character. She wouldn't have minded learning a little more about him and some of the others, but, that's a staple of old WWII movies that Ayer avoided. Although she would have liked just a little more. Pete Hammond/Deadline HollywoodPete said he could not believe how good the film was. He mentioned he is a big David Ayer fan. He thought all the performances were great, especially Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. “Do not count out Brad Pitt this year . “ He said the film is definitely in the Best Picture race -- especially a push for all of the crafts and not to forget that the Academy loves a war movie. Roger Durling/Executive Director Santa Barbara Film FestivalRoger was visibly moved and completely shaken after the screening, and on the spot invited the film to screen at the Festival’s Cinema Society. He said the film had so much humanity and there was never a false note. He loved the authenticity and texture of the film and was very inquisitive about how it was shot. He was a fan of both Logan Lerman and Brad Pitt’s performances and noted it was career shifting role for Shia (in light of his recent press). He was incredibly enthusiastic in his reaction. Timothy Blake/President of SAG Film SocietyShe said it was an incredible ensemble performance. It was all about the work-it was all up there on the screen. Everyone one of the actors gave an amazing performance. She feels that Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman were standouts and gave Award caliber performances. Going in she felt this would skew more male, but after seeing it, and they way she personally felt, she feels women will respond to it as well. She thinks the film has a good chance to be nominated for SAG ensemble. Tim Gray/VarietyHe thinks this is a new level of achievement for Brad Pitt. He is a big supporter of the film. Especially noted the Cinematography and Steven Price’s score. Peter Travers/ Rolling StonePeter really liked the movie. He thinks we are a lock for Logan Lerman in supporting and we should be able to get one of the Best Picture slots. He thought the film had excellent below the line chances, as well. He thought Brad Pitt was fantastic, but reminded us, the lead category is just very competitive this year. Peter felt David Ayer did a terrific job at showing the humanity in war. He loved the dinner scene and loved that the German soldier didn’t kill Logan at the end. Peter expected the movie to be much more gratuitous, but was pleased it was not. To him if felt very human, very emotional and very real. He felt you don’t leave the film feeling despondent -- you actually feel like things happened for a reason. He said the film moved at a swift pace and held his interest throughout. Dave Karger/FANDANGODave enjoyed the movie and said that it would be included in his top 15 picks of the year, but not yet in his top 10. He thought it was a B+ film if he were rating it. He thought the performances were powerful, but noted that this is a very strong year for males and it will be tough for actor nominations. Dave said that the film started a little slow for him, but once they got into the apartment with the two women, it took off and he was emotionally invested. He said that the film could have a below-the-line push for the crafts categories. Elvis Mitchell/INTERVIEWElvis thought the scene in the house is an extraordinary sequence. He said that while it seems digressive, it's completely pushing the story forward in emotional and narrative terms and we know who each of those guys are in that house. He thought it is refreshing to see a movie in which tension is subject of a movie in the most subtle way possible, and in which PTSD is illustrated as texture rather than declaimed as a story point.",Private

He said that he could predict what was going to happen in some scenes and that he was still on the edge of his seat the entire time. He thought it was very well done. Bruce Kirkland/TORONTO SUNBruce said it was a very good film. He said it’s realistic and that it does an excellent job in showing how life would have been like to the men fighting in tanks. Bruce whimsically referenced “Das Boot” and praised “Fury” as another example of great filmmaking in cramped quarters. He especially liked the fact that there were no heroes in the story. He also said the cast was strong, and that Pitt’s performance is exceptionally strong because it’s so authentic. He likened the film and the cast to “Band of Brothers”. Bruce said there is nothing he has to criticize about the film with the exception of the music, which he thought was weak. Andrew Dansby/HOUSTON CHRONICLEAndrew said he was impressed, particularly with the way David Ayer conveyed the physical aspect of war debt, which tended to be more common in Vietnam films than World War II. He said the film was nicely conveyed with a sense of brutality & disconnect while hinting at post traumatic stress disorder. He said the film is not easy to watch, but it is moving. Marc Mohan/THE OREGONIAN Marc’s reaction to the film was mixed/positive. He thought that it was trying to be two movies: a gritty anti-war story, emphasizing the horrible parts about war that we often don’t see in typical Hollywood fare. At the same time, a gung-ho exciting war movie full of faced paced action. He felt that the film ended up feeling somewhat awkward in its message. He described it as “depressing as heck” but assumed that, that was the intention. Overall, he said there were many good elements but they seemed in conflict at times. He is very interested in speaking with David Ayer about the film and I get the sense that talking over these thoughts with the director would be beneficial. Steve “Capone” Prokopy/AIN’T IT COOL NEWS Steve enjoyed the film very much. He thought it was very authentic yet brutal. He said that the acting was superb and notes that it was one of the better films he’s seen so far this year. He also noted that the dialogue between Brad Pit and Logan Lerman’s characters towards the end was raw and sincere.. “it brought the film together.” Clint O’Connor/THE PLAIN DEALER “Wow.” ""Fury"" is incredibly intense. Watching it is a very emotional experience. I was a big fan of David Ayer's ""End of Watch,"" which never really caught on in theaters for some reason. He is a master of hard-core realism. ""Fury"" grabs you by the chest and demands your attention. It is very well-made and very well-acted. There isn't much time to contemplate the horrors of warfare because they are splattering all around you. With the macro of a world war raging, it is the micro that grabs us: the one-on-one human relationships.” Jeff Simon/BUFFALO NEWS “Very effective! A brutal, honest war movie that you really don’t see anymore! Very unusual to see that type of brutal movie these days! Something you don’t expect!” Zac Shull/BALLERSTATUS.COMZac loved FURY, calling it one of the most realistic war movies he has ever seen. He felt that David Ayer perfectly balanced the film with elements of both humor and drama. He noted that at times FURY felt like a horror movie in the way that it drew him in and kept him on bated breath. Zac thought that all of the characters were very well rounded and distinct with their own unique personalities and thought that director David Ayer did a great job of creating individuals who seemed haphazardly thrown together to create a rag-tag team of soldiers. Lastly, Zac thought that the cinematography was amazing, specifically the ""gritty"" imagery in the final battle scene. Kam Williams/KAM WILLIAMS SYNDICATE Kam Williams absolutely loved FURY and thought David Ayer’s directorial vision was ""ethereal."" He noted it felt like a cross between Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, He thought the story was gripping and held his attention from start to finish. Every aspect of FURY made him feel as if he was in the tank with the crew, only further enhancing the tension amongst War Daddy and his men. Kam thoroughly enjoyed the development of each soldier, saying that he felt the individual characters were very well defined without being stereotypical. He praised Jon Bernthal for playing Grady Travis as the unlikeable jerk. Regarding the cast in its entirety, he felt that they were completely believable as the fictional character they portrayed on screen. While he was sad that the crew died, he felt that Logan Lerman's escape did leave him with a glimmer of hope. Overall, Kam felt that FURY was an unpredictable, epic war film that was ""tremendously done."" Ann Hornaday/WASHINGTON POSTAnn left the theater feeling the intensity of the film. She felt it is an interesting portrait of the war from such a different perspectives. She noted there are many substantial scenes and concepts to address in her interview with David Ayer and the cast. She’s really looking forward to the conversation in DC. Steven Rea/PHILADELPHIA INQUIRERSteven thought FURY was a visceral, gripping WWII drama. He thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through, noting he especially like that it showed the darker side, the dread, the dirt. He though Brad Pitt did an excellent job, and thought Logan Lerman as the green recruit was great. Steven said, in both FURY and END OF WATCH, David Ayer has shown a real skill for putting the viewer right there in the thick of things and makes the audience feel a part of the action. Jeff Wells/HOLLYWOOD ELSEWHEREJeff said that the film is, ""Filled with a good amount of exciting, jolting verisimilitude. Otherwise forget it."" ""It's good, it's not great. It's strong when it's strong, but otherwise it's....weird?"" He did not care for the extended domestic sequence with the two German women, which he thought went on too long. Jeff said he felt like the ""Wild Bunch finale"" didn't make sense to him because in his words, ""they weren't trapped, they could have run for the trees,"" but chose not to. He said it was a case of Nihilism, pure and simple. ""Fury is very strong in some respects -- great battle verisimilitude -- but ultimately thought it was too nihilistic.” Kris Tapley/HITFIXKris said “I kind of loved a lot of it. It feels like he bit off more than he could chew but it's fascinating watching all the ideas bounce around. That scene with the German girls is kind of amazing. Reminded me of the French plantation sequence in ‘Apocalypse Now Redux.’ I wonder about Oscars. I'm not squeamish about this stuff, strangely (as in war trauma in movies), but even I thought it probably leaned too heavily on that. After a while it's sort of numbing. That could be difficult with that crowd. Opening scene is really awesome intro to the crew. I've heard of a bunch of stuff that they took out of the movie but it sounds like they stripped away exactly what they needed to. I dug it.” Greg Ellwood/HITFIXGreg enjoyed the action scenes in the movie, but thought the script was lacking. He though that Brad made the most of his role and gave a great performance with a character that wasn’t deeply written. He thought the DP, sound and production designers all could get nominations. He felt Logan Lerman had a shot for Best Supporting Actor. David Poland/MOVIE CITY NEWSDavid said he cannot stop thinking about Fury. He said, “this movie is so incredibly current. It's about so many things that resonate right now and the best war movie in 30 years that's really about war. He can’t wait to see it again. He added, “the Oscar race is now on. There is finally a best picture. A REAL movie. Why have you been hiding this film, it's ridiculously amazing. It is better than any of the other movies I thought were the best picture (Birdman, Boyhood and definitely better than Gone Girl or the films from Toronto).I think the narrative that all the press is hoping will play out — could. If Angelina's movie lives up to the hype, it could be Brad against Angie.” Michael Cieply/THE NEW YORK TIMES“Fury is every bit as good as I figured it would be. Very tough, but really good. Best part is, my wife liked it, and she's a much tougher audience for this one. I'm pulling together a kind of reported essay on the three looming World War II movies, Fury, The Imitation Game, and Unbroken. Nothing elaborate; just trying to explain that they all have radically different takes on what prevailed: Guts, brains, spirit. Fury is guts in this equation. “ Ethan Alter/FILM JOURNALEthan said that overall he would give the film a B. He said he was mixed on the film when it comes to the story, but he thought that the visuals were quite striking. He thought the action sequences--particularly that one tank battle with the three American tanks against the one German tank--were very well executed and that David Ayer did a nice job capturing the inside-the-tank dynamics amongst the five men. Of the cast, Jon Bernthal struck him as a key standout. He did feel that the narrative dragged at times. Neil Goldman/CHARLIE ROSENeil enjoyed the film, but he did have some criticisms to share. He feels the camera shots are interesting and at 2 hours 15 minutes, the movie moves. He said the acting is great and that Jon Bernthal steals the show. Neil feels that even though the explosions get repetitive, Brad Pitt holds the film together and the film feels authentic. Two scenes that Neil thinks are incredibly gripping are Norman resisting Brad Pitt's order to kill the German officer and Norman and Brad Pitt's dinner with the German women and their drunken American tank mates crashing the meal. Neil thinks some of the shots in the movie are beautiful like “the men draped over the tank coming at us with the backdrop of a barren landscape; the neon light show of artillery fire, etc.” He said that you definitely get a sense of the camaraderie of tankers…”the banter, the horseplay, the claustrophobia, the differences of opinion and belief that bump up against each other because four men are housed so tightly together, the anger/resentment, (Norman & Brad Pitt's early beef, Norman's fighting with Jon Bernthal's character), but also the love that exists between them.” Neil is questioning what the movie is ultimately about and feels that none of the themes are fully explored. He didn't find it to be a particularly smart movie or leave much to talk about afterwards. Further, Neil thought it was unrealistic that the SS guard would allow one of them to get away at the end of the movie. But ultimately, Neil said FURY is not a bad way to spend 2 hrs 15 minutes if you're looking for some entertainment.” Lynn Hirschberg/WLynn liked the film, but wasn’t blown away by it. She said it was quite an experience and an exhausting film. Ultimately, she commented that it is really an oppressive anti-war film and by the end you end up asking “Why, why, why” which is very powerful. Brad Pitt is the best thing in the film and its heart and soul – if you take him out there would be a problem. He took what is on the page and really made it meaningful, it is clearly a very deep and personal performance and it is unlike anything he has done in previous roles – Wardaddy is a lost soul. He could get a nomination even in such a crowded year for actors. The other cast was good, though they weren’t given enough to do. It really is Brad Pitt’s show. Logan Lerman was better than he usually is in a somewhat clichéd character. Shia LaBeouf was very good. Lynn wished that there was some more back story to the characters. John Anderson/NEWSDAYJohn thought the film was fantastic and said he thinks Brad Pitt could get a nomination though it will be tough given how crowded the actor field is this year. He also said that he “wouldn’t be surprised if the film could be considered quite controversial given that virtually everyone is psychotic, the war-glory BS is completely debunked and the close to rape sequence is like nothing I’ve seen in American film.” Missy Schwartz/ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLYMissy liked the film a lot, though she did feel it was a hard movie to figure out (clearly, David Ayer is saying a lot). Everyone was really good and Brad Pitt was excellent. She really believed him as Wardaddy. Shia LaBeouf was terrific. Unfortunately, she found the pivotal role of Norman underwritten and she was not totally onboard with him. Though important, she felt the apartment scene was a bit long. It is always challenging to make a film which is almost all battle sequences but she believed everything in FURY – all the guys were in it for the long haul, how fast transform in war the do or die mentality. As an audience, people are so trained to have some sort of happy ending and Missy said the film works so well because by the end it is truly devastating with everyone dying, really showing the trials and tribulation of war. The exhaustion of the characters which wears down on the soul is felt by the audience and is very effective. Rich Turner/WALL STREET JOURNALRich liked the film and thinks it will do quite well. Michael Arbeiter/NY DAILY NEWSMichael liked the film and thought the dynamic of the five guys was especially impressive. Samantha Miller/PEOPLESamantha liked the film and commented that the acting across the board was excellent. She said it is very well-made and all the action was very clear and visceral. She thought the film was intense and she liked the Howard Hawks/Sam Peckinpah male bonding vibe. She didn’t care for the score. Kara Warner/FREELANCE/SCREENRANT.COM/PLAYBOY.COMKara thought there is a LOT of great in the movie - the visuals, the tanks, the battle sequences, the acting - all of those elements are so satisfying. She said the one thing she couldn’t wrap her head around is the story. She said it almost pulls you in enough to fall in love with the guys and their tank family, but just doesn't quite get there. She commented it is beautifully shot and acted. Krista Smith/ VANITY FAIR (additional reaction)Krista thought it was so great to see Brad Pitt carry a movie again. She thought his performance was fantastic. She said that ironically for her, the freshness from the film was Shia LaBeouf. He is the heart of the movie. She liked that God was his justification for what they’re doing. She found that part fascinating, where she wanted to see more of that from the other characters. She would have been fine with 10 or 15 more minutes added to the movie if it allowed her to become better acquainted with each character. She loved the action and the realness of the film; however, she felt the script was lacking and there wasn’t much freshness to it. For instance, she didn’t understand the “Best Job I ever had” line. While she thought Logan Lerman’s character was phenomenal, she felt that Jon Bernthal’s character was reduced to a caricature and that Michael Pen’s character felt too modern. She thought that perhaps it was the dialogue written for him, but it didn’t feel like he was from 1945. As for the ending scene, she found it rather unbelievable. While the film felt so realistic throughout its entirety, she thought that Norman should have either been killed by the German soldier or had the savvy to survive. For her, it seemed unrealistic that the German soldier was willing to spare Norman’s life after he and the four other guys mauled down almost 300 Nazis. All-in-all, she thinks the movie will do very well commercially because it’s Brad Pitt. Currently, she is undecided on a best picture nomination.. she can’t completely rule it out. For Golden Globes, she thinks Brad Pitt and the film will definitely receive nominations. She would give the film a solid B+. Krista really liked the movie. She said she “wanted more of it.” Not more of the violence, but more of the story. She thought that Shia LaBeouf’s performance was fantastic. She did think Brad Pitt was great and really liked the scene in the apartment with the girls. Elena Howe/ LA TIMESElena said she liked the film a lot. However, she said it wasn’t quite as unique of a story as she had expected. She did say it was gripping and well acted. She thinks the film is worthy of some Oscar campaigning but didn’t elaborate any further. Elena added: “I think Logan Lerman in supporting for sure, Brad Pitt for lead… picture and director might be worthwhile as well given that there’s no clear frontrunner yet.” Jane Sarkin / VANITY FAIRJane loved the film and Brad Pitt. She said all of the performances are perfect and Logan Lerman is a revelation. The battle scenes are long and intense which are very important yet unpleasant. Lisa Hintelmann / ESQUIREAlthough this is not Lisa’s favorite genre, she did like the film and thought that Brad Pitt was terrific – it is a very complex character and he does an incredible job showing all of the varying traits: he is both brutal and tender at the same time; a father figure of sorts but not in an overbearing or clichéd way. Though she liked the supporting performances none of them stood out for her. The film is very well done and David Ayer does a great job at making a very intimate film about a very big thing and it works very well. The battle scenes are extremely visceral bringing the audience right to the frontlines of the war. She said the strongest scene is the apartment scene and she loved Alicia von Rittberg as Emma saying she reminded her of Abbie Cornish and Lea Seydoux. Lisa is a huge fan of End of Watch and how real and deep the relationship between Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhaal is and hoped to see that in Fury. Unfortunately, though they speak of it throughout the film, she never truly got the feeling of camaraderie between the guys in the tank and she had hoped to. Andrea Oliveri / DETAILSAndrea liked FURY and felt that it was a solid B+/A-. In addition to the performances, the cinematography, editing and effects were all top notch. She thought though the beginning was a bit slow, the story was strong and really picked up once Logan’s character was introduced. She said at first it seemed like a varied mix with the supporting actors, but she felt they all worked really well together which cements the fact that Brad Pitt is an amazing actor. Andrea commented that Shia LaBeouf is immensely talented and she LOVED Jon Bernthal. She also felt that Logan Lerman has such a great range and was extremely believable. Logan Lerman’s first shooting scene was a favorite as was Shia LaBeouf praying with the dying soldier. She loved the scene with the women in the German house – you really understood Wardaddy’s role in the story and how protective he was of Norman. She felt the tension was great when the rest of the squad came in drunk. All of the relationships in the film are complicated and interesting especially the brotherly bond between Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena and Shia LaBeouf -- and Brad Pitt definitely inhabited the role of Wardaddy. Andrea loved that he looked older and weathered which made him even more believable in the role. Kathy Heintzelman / FREELANCEKathy said she would count herself as a David Ayer fan – she really liked End of Watch. She thought Fury was well done, overall but it wasn't her favorite film this year. She would give the film a B. She said got very mixed messages from it -- and maybe that's realistic and commendable, but it felt a little manipulative to her. For example, a lot of it sends the ""war is hell"" message, but by the final standoff, with the swelling music, it seemed like this was the greatest job and the greatest camaraderie these guys were ever going to have (they even say as much). “Maybe that's the way battle really is, I don't know; or maybe that's the way it felt to the Greatest Generation in a war where there was a much clearer sense of good and evil.” But she thought it undercut the moral dilemmas the young newbie was wrestling with in the first half of the film. To her there were two standout sequences -- the one where the two tanks are battling each other, and the one in the house in the German town with the two women. In the tank sequence, she was really engaged with the mechanics of the battle in ways she wasn't during the final sequence. And the German town scene was just... weird in an interesting way. She couldn't quite buy that the other guys from the tank would be that harassing when their chief was clearly upset by their behavior. Or why he didn't just tell them to knock it off. Kathy didn't understand the dynamics there, but it was interesting and a nice break from battle scenes. The way the gunshots were indicated with colored laser-like bursts distracted her-- she felt it seemed cartoonish or video-game-ish. Kathy did mention for all she knows that's the way it really looks on the battlefield, but again, it sent a kind of mixed message. Kathy liked the acting although thought the characters were sort of stock. What happened with the newbie seemed obvious from the beginning -- if he didn't die early on he'd end up the way he did. And, it was hard to forget that that was Brad Pitt -- no fault of his acting, but he was a figurehead or symbol more than an actual character. She wouldn't have minded learning a little more about him and some of the others, but, that's a staple of old WWII movies that Ayer avoided. Although she would have liked just a little more. Pete Hammond/Deadline HollywoodPete said he could not believe how good the film was. He mentioned he is a big David Ayer fan. He thought all the performances were great, especially Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. “Do not count out Brad Pitt this year . “ He said the film is definitely in the Best Picture race -- especially a push for all of the crafts and not to forget that the Academy loves a war movie. Roger Durling/Executive Director Santa Barbara Film FestivalRoger was visibly moved and completely shaken after the screening, and on the spot invited the film to screen at the Festival’s Cinema Society. He said the film had so much humanity and there was never a false note. He loved the authenticity and texture of the film and was very inquisitive about how it was shot. He was a fan of both Logan Lerman and Brad Pitt’s performances and noted it was career shifting role for Shia (in light of his recent press). He was incredibly enthusiastic in his reaction. Timothy Blake/President of SAG Film SocietyShe said it was an incredible ensemble performance. It was all about the work-it was all up there on the screen. Everyone one of the actors gave an amazing performance. She feels that Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman were standouts and gave Award caliber performances. Going in she felt this would skew more male, but after seeing it, and they way she personally felt, she feels women will respond to it as well. She thinks the film has a good chance to be nominated for SAG ensemble. Tim Gray/VarietyHe thinks this is a new level of achievement for Brad Pitt. He is a big supporter of the film. Especially noted the Cinematography and Steven Price’s score. Peter Travers/ Rolling StonePeter really liked the movie. He thinks we are a lock for Logan Lerman in supporting and we should be able to get one of the Best Picture slots. He thought the film had excellent below the line chances, as well. He thought Brad Pitt was fantastic, but reminded us, the lead category is just very competitive this year. Peter felt David Ayer did a terrific job at showing the humanity in war. He loved the dinner scene and loved that the German soldier didn’t kill Logan at the end. Peter expected the movie to be much more gratuitous, but was pleased it was not. To him if felt very human, very emotional and very real. He felt you don’t leave the film feeling despondent -- you actually feel like things happened for a reason. He said the film moved at a swift pace and held his interest throughout. Dave Karger/FANDANGODave enjoyed the movie and said that it would be included in his top 15 picks of the year, but not yet in his top 10. He thought it was a B+ film if he were rating it. He thought the performances were powerful, but noted that this is a very strong year for males and it will be tough for actor nominations. Dave said that the film started a little slow for him, but once they got into the apartment with the two women, it took off and he was emotionally invested. He said that the film could have a below-the-line push for the crafts categories. Elvis Mitchell/INTERVIEWElvis thought the scene in the house is an extraordinary sequence. He said that while it seems digressive, it's completely pushing the story forward in emotional and narrative terms and we know who each of those guys are in that house. He thought it is refreshing to see a movie in which tension is subject of a movie in the most subtle way possible, and in which PTSD is illustrated as texture rather than declaimed as a story point.",Private

Michael Arbeiter/NY DAILY NEWSMichael liked the film and thought the dynamic of the five guys was especially impressive. Samantha Miller/PEOPLESamantha liked the film and commented that the acting across the board was excellent. She said it is very well-made and all the action was very clear and visceral. She thought the film was intense and she liked the Howard Hawks/Sam Peckinpah male bonding vibe. She didn’t care for the score. Kara Warner/FREELANCE/SCREENRANT.COM/PLAYBOY.COMKara thought there is a LOT of great in the movie - the visuals, the tanks, the battle sequences, the acting - all of those elements are so satisfying. She said the one thing she couldn’t wrap her head around is the story. She said it almost pulls you in enough to fall in love with the guys and their tank family, but just doesn't quite get there. She commented it is beautifully shot and acted. Krista Smith/ VANITY FAIR (additional reaction)Krista thought it was so great to see Brad Pitt carry a movie again. She thought his performance was fantastic. She said that ironically for her, the freshness from the film was Shia LaBeouf. He is the heart of the movie. She liked that God was his justification for what they’re doing. She found that part fascinating, where she wanted to see more of that from the other characters. She would have been fine with 10 or 15 more minutes added to the movie if it allowed her to become better acquainted with each character. She loved the action and the realness of the film; however, she felt the script was lacking and there wasn’t much freshness to it. For instance, she didn’t understand the “Best Job I ever had” line. While she thought Logan Lerman’s character was phenomenal, she felt that Jon Bernthal’s character was reduced to a caricature and that Michael Pen’s character felt too modern. She thought that perhaps it was the dialogue written for him, but it didn’t feel like he was from 1945. As for the ending scene, she found it rather unbelievable. While the film felt so realistic throughout its entirety, she thought that Norman should have either been killed by the German soldier or had the savvy to survive. For her, it seemed unrealistic that the German soldier was willing to spare Norman’s life after he and the four other guys mauled down almost 300 Nazis. All-in-all, she thinks the movie will do very well commercially because it’s Brad Pitt. Currently, she is undecided on a best picture nomination.. she can’t completely rule it out. For Golden Globes, she thinks Brad Pitt and the film will definitely receive nominations. She would give the film a solid B+. Krista really liked the movie. She said she “wanted more of it.” Not more of the violence, but more of the story. She thought that Shia LaBeouf’s performance was fantastic. She did think Brad Pitt was great and really liked the scene in the apartment with the girls. Elena Howe/ LA TIMESElena said she liked the film a lot. However, she said it wasn’t quite as unique of a story as she had expected. She did say it was gripping and well acted. She thinks the film is worthy of some Oscar campaigning but didn’t elaborate any further. Elena added: “I think Logan Lerman in supporting for sure, Brad Pitt for lead… picture and director might be worthwhile as well given that there’s no clear frontrunner yet.” Jane Sarkin / VANITY FAIRJane loved the film and Brad Pitt. She said all of the performances are perfect and Logan Lerman is a revelation. The battle scenes are long and intense which are very important yet unpleasant. Lisa Hintelmann / ESQUIREAlthough this is not Lisa’s favorite genre, she did like the film and thought that Brad Pitt was terrific – it is a very complex character and he does an incredible job showing all of the varying traits: he is both brutal and tender at the same time; a father figure of sorts but not in an overbearing or clichéd way. Though she liked the supporting performances none of them stood out for her. The film is very well done and David Ayer does a great job at making a very intimate film about a very big thing and it works very well. The battle scenes are extremely visceral bringing the audience right to the frontlines of the war. She said the strongest scene is the apartment scene and she loved Alicia von Rittberg as Emma saying she reminded her of Abbie Cornish and Lea Seydoux. Lisa is a huge fan of End of Watch and how real and deep the relationship between Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhaal is and hoped to see that in Fury. Unfortunately, though they speak of it throughout the film, she never truly got the feeling of camaraderie between the guys in the tank and she had hoped to. Andrea Oliveri / DETAILSAndrea liked FURY and felt that it was a solid B+/A-. In addition to the performances, the cinematography, editing and effects were all top notch. She thought though the beginning was a bit slow, the story was strong and really picked up once Logan’s character was introduced. She said at first it seemed like a varied mix with the supporting actors, but she felt they all worked really well together which cements the fact that Brad Pitt is an amazing actor. Andrea commented that Shia LaBeouf is immensely talented and she LOVED Jon Bernthal. She also felt that Logan Lerman has such a great range and was extremely believable. Logan Lerman’s first shooting scene was a favorite as was Shia LaBeouf praying with the dying soldier. She loved the scene with the women in the German house – you really understood Wardaddy’s role in the story and how protective he was of Norman. She felt the tension was great when the rest of the squad came in drunk. All of the relationships in the film are complicated and interesting especially the brotherly bond between Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena and Shia LaBeouf -- and Brad Pitt definitely inhabited the role of Wardaddy. Andrea loved that he looked older and weathered which made him even more believable in the role. Kathy Heintzelman / FREELANCEKathy said she would count herself as a David Ayer fan – she really liked End of Watch. She thought Fury was well done, overall but it wasn't her favorite film this year. She would give the film a B. She said got very mixed messages from it -- and maybe that's realistic and commendable, but it felt a little manipulative to her. For example, a lot of it sends the ""war is hell"" message, but by the final standoff, with the swelling music, it seemed like this was the greatest job and the greatest camaraderie these guys were ever going to have (they even say as much). “Maybe that's the way battle really is, I don't know; or maybe that's the way it felt to the Greatest Generation in a war where there was a much clearer sense of good and evil.” But she thought it undercut the moral dilemmas the young newbie was wrestling with in the first half of the film. To her there were two standout sequences -- the one where the two tanks are battling each other, and the one in the house in the German town with the two women. In the tank sequence, she was really engaged with the mechanics of the battle in ways she wasn't during the final sequence. And the German town scene was just... weird in an interesting way. She couldn't quite buy that the other guys from the tank would be that harassing when their chief was clearly upset by their behavior. Or why he didn't just tell them to knock it off. Kathy didn't understand the dynamics there, but it was interesting and a nice break from battle scenes. The way the gunshots were indicated with colored laser-like bursts distracted her-- she felt it seemed cartoonish or video-game-ish. Kathy did mention for all she knows that's the way it really looks on the battlefield, but again, it sent a kind of mixed message. Kathy liked the acting although thought the characters were sort of stock. What happened with the newbie seemed obvious from the beginning -- if he didn't die early on he'd end up the way he did. And, it was hard to forget that that was Brad Pitt -- no fault of his acting, but he was a figurehead or symbol more than an actual character. She wouldn't have minded learning a little more about him and some of the others, but, that's a staple of old WWII movies that Ayer avoided. Although she would have liked just a little more. Pete Hammond/Deadline HollywoodPete said he could not believe how good the film was. He mentioned he is a big David Ayer fan. He thought all the performances were great, especially Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. “Do not count out Brad Pitt this year . “ He said the film is definitely in the Best Picture race -- especially a push for all of the crafts and not to forget that the Academy loves a war movie. Roger Durling/Executive Director Santa Barbara Film FestivalRoger was visibly moved and completely shaken after the screening, and on the spot invited the film to screen at the Festival’s Cinema Society. He said the film had so much humanity and there was never a false note. He loved the authenticity and texture of the film and was very inquisitive about how it was shot. He was a fan of both Logan Lerman and Brad Pitt’s performances and noted it was career shifting role for Shia (in light of his recent press). He was incredibly enthusiastic in his reaction. Timothy Blake/President of SAG Film SocietyShe said it was an incredible ensemble performance. It was all about the work-it was all up there on the screen. Everyone one of the actors gave an amazing performance. She feels that Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman were standouts and gave Award caliber performances. Going in she felt this would skew more male, but after seeing it, and they way she personally felt, she feels women will respond to it as well. She thinks the film has a good chance to be nominated for SAG ensemble. Tim Gray/VarietyHe thinks this is a new level of achievement for Brad Pitt. He is a big supporter of the film. Especially noted the Cinematography and Steven Price’s score. Peter Travers/ Rolling StonePeter really liked the movie. He thinks we are a lock for Logan Lerman in supporting and we should be able to get one of the Best Picture slots. He thought the film had excellent below the line chances, as well. He thought Brad Pitt was fantastic, but reminded us, the lead category is just very competitive this year. Peter felt David Ayer did a terrific job at showing the humanity in war. He loved the dinner scene and loved that the German soldier didn’t kill Logan at the end. Peter expected the movie to be much more gratuitous, but was pleased it was not. To him if felt very human, very emotional and very real. He felt you don’t leave the film feeling despondent -- you actually feel like things happened for a reason. He said the film moved at a swift pace and held his interest throughout. Dave Karger/FANDANGODave enjoyed the movie and said that it would be included in his top 15 picks of the year, but not yet in his top 10. He thought it was a B+ film if he were rating it. He thought the performances were powerful, but noted that this is a very strong year for males and it will be tough for actor nominations. Dave said that the film started a little slow for him, but once they got into the apartment with the two women, it took off and he was emotionally invested. He said that the film could have a below-the-line push for the crafts categories. Elvis Mitchell/INTERVIEWElvis thought the scene in the house is an extraordinary sequence. He said that while it seems digressive, it's completely pushing the story forward in emotional and narrative terms and we know who each of those guys are in that house. He thought it is refreshing to see a movie in which tension is subject of a movie in the most subtle way possible, and in which PTSD is illustrated as texture rather than declaimed as a story point.",Private

"Below please find a recap of the UK National Newspaper reviews. Also attached is a PDF of the full reviews. SUNDAY TELEGRAPH – 4/5 STARS – POSITIVE... an astonishing set-piece battle, gripping in its sheer orderliness...In the down-time between battles, Ayer lets the quieter moments run.......There’s no glory in this moment, but it feels strange enough to be truthful – another encounter those back home could never hope to understand. Ayer’s film, with its fearsome, steam-hammer power, brings us as close to that understanding as cinema can. EVENING STANDARD – 4/5 STARS – POSITIVE‘Brutal and unmissable depiction of the fury of war’This extraordinarily intense and focussed film...Fury sets a new standard for graphic violence and unsparing detail in war films...Fury may not be quite so overwhelming as Elem Klimov's classic Come and See, or as ambitious as Saving Private Ryan, but it's unmissable nevertheless. DAILY STAR SUNDAY – 3/5 STARS – MIXED‘Fury is one of those blood-splattered, testosterone-soaked, war-is-hell action flicks...A brilliant opening scene gives us an early indication of why the tank has earned the nickname ‘Fury’......thrillingly staged battle scenes...Sadly, director David Ayer abandons the gritty realism with a credulity-straining finale.But at least it clings to a certain truth. SUNDAY MIRROR – 4/5 STARS – POSITIVEBrad Pitt is on top form...Fury takes a smartly bleak view of the muddy, bloody and grim battlefield...It features some stunning set-pieces...Grim, gory and gut wrenching, Fury may be low-key in the sense of war-movie heroism, but it is a powerful look into the horrific, claustrophobic intensity of a tank crew just trying to survive. METRO – 4/5 STARS – POSITIVEPitt is terrific as the battle-scarred Don......it’s an impressive film that balances action and character.Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal put in equally excellent performances...David Ayer’s film has plenty of action: grimy, gritty and ultimately gripping.A claustrophobic, thoroughly involving war film with a strong cast. Consider this one a contender for the Oscars. DAILY EXPRESS – 4/5 stars – POSITIVE‘Shell shocks amid war’s hellish fury’It is a brutal, visceral piece of work that may be the best American war movie since Saving Private Ryan.Fury is about the sheer hell of war and the knowledge that every moment could be your last. It also conveys a sense that there was no alternative but to follow orders, kill the enemy and trust in God...The battle scenes are unflinching as tanks trample over bodies, mortar shells send limbs flying through the air and direct hits leave burning bodies stumbling around in torment. Fury is a celebration of the odd camaraderie that is forged in battle as a disparate group becomes a dysfunctional family.Writer/director David Ayer is well served by his lead ensemble, with a charismatic Pitt in John Wayne mode and young Logan Lerman giving the best performance of his career.Fury might not tell us anything new but it is a striking insight into what we demanded of the brave souls who fought and won the Second World War and why so many chose never to talk about it again. DAILY MAIL – 5/5 STARS – POSITIVE‘Brad Pitt is scintillating as a brutal tank commander in one of the greatest war films ever made’Every so often, a war film redefines the genre, as Apocalypse Now did 35 years ago. Fury belongs in the same exalted category, not so much through the depiction of good and bad on both sides, which we’ve seen before, but with its rivetingly tense and realistic combat scenes. Only the famous opening of Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan made me sit up in quite the same way. ...Pitt is still outstanding as a man who has found his testosterone-soaked element, and Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal and Michael Pena no less so as his comrades. The claustrophobia of tank warfare is brilliantly evoked......Ayer has made a cracking war film, one of the best I’ve seen for years. DAILY MIRROR – 3/5 STARS – MIXED‘Roll out the barrel’...while Fury, set in the dying days of the Second World War, continually stresses the horrors of combat, it ditches high-minded sentiments for a finale that absolutely wallows in guts and glory. It’s this schizophrenia – together with its American triumphalism – that makes it look like a piece of unsubtle propaganda, no matter how much mud it’s caked in.It’s the human drama, however, playing out within the tank’s claustrophobic confines that’s the film’s strongest suit....Ayer can’t resist tossing the high-mindedness out of the window for a frankly ludicrous David vs. Goliath battle at the end. THE INDEPENDENT – 2/5 STARS – MIXED/NEGATIVE‘Pitt’s war is all action, no nuance’David Ayer’s Fury...owes a very obvious debt to Fuller: Like Fuller’s The Big Red One, it is an epic with a warped and delirious feel...Ayer tries to combine a grunt-eye view of combat with poetic symbolism. There is a jarring uncertainty of tone throughout Fury. On one hand, Ayer emphasises the pity and squalor of war.... The film underlines the psychic trauma its protagonists faced. At the same time, Ayer is serving up a rip-roaring, old-fashioned Boy’s Own adventure.It’s thoroughly contradictory – an anti-war film that also wants to be an action thriller. But for all the skill with which it is made and the full-blooded commitments of all the performances, what Fury misses utterly is the psychological nuance and emotional depth you will always find in a Sam Fuller movie. THE TIMES – 2/5 STARS - NEGATIVE‘The Brad, the bad and the ugly’Even Brad Pitt’s tank commander fails to make this bloodthirsty war movie credible.There is no denying that Fury is a serviceable and gripping war movie, with a testosterone-saturated star in Brad Pitt. Its restaging of Second World War tank battles is slick, even bloodily balletic... But those expecting the intelligent character development of Band of Brothers, The Pacific and even Saving Private Ryan will find this to be little more than a display of five archetypes in a tin can. Ayer...seems keen to display war at its most meaty and graphic... Yet all the horror seems a disgusting display of bravado, disconnected from the men themselves....we expect more from our war movies. And Fury is by no means up to scratch. DAILY STAR – 4/5 STARS – POSITIVE‘Brad Ass’...Pitt is in terrific fighting form as a battle-hardened US Sherman tank commander.David Ayer’s strong, unsentimental script, and matching direction ensure that Pitt’s hard-as-nails Sergeant Wardaddy and the crew of his Sherman tank emerge as real flesh and blood characters rather than celluloid clichés. The riveting blend of human drama and nightmarishly realistic bloody wartime action never relaxes its throttling grip in one of the best war movies I’ve seen. THE GUARDIAN – 3/5 STARS – MIXED‘Rage inside the machine’Brad Pitt’s action movie about an American tank commander and his wearied crew in the final year of the second world war has topped the US box office, and is set to do the same here. I originally reviewed it during the London film festival – it is watchable and well-made, though I can’t share the saucer-eyed excitement with which it has been received by some...Pitt himself has given an interview stating that war is not a video game – although Fury is clearly influenced by games such as Call of Duty, as well as movies such as The Dirty Dozen, Inglourious Basterds and Saving Private Ryan.Ayer does well in creating the weird listless boredom of war – interspersed with sudden frenzies of violence and fear as the soldiers engage the enemy. In the end, Pitt’s men seem destined for their own Alamo or Little Bighorn in the German countryside. It’s rousing, old-fashioned film-making. THE SUN – 4/5 STARS – POSITIVE...An apt title for this wildly violent World War Two movie starring an angry Brad Pitt in charge of a battle-scarred tank crew in teh final days of the conflict.For director David Ayer, realism is the order of the day. The battles are nerve-shredding and the cast electrifying, especially Pitt and Shia LaBeouf. Yet something keeps this from the list of all-time great war movies.Although unwavering in its depiction of war’s horrors, it somehow forgets to satisfy as a movie.The final act is surprisingly devoid of emotion. That said, Fury remains a brutally efficient, furiously intense experience.",Private
"THR: Box Office: Brad Pitt's 'Fury' Conquers Competition With $23.5M Weekend By Pamela McClintockOctober 19, 2014 'Gone Girl' edges out 'The Book of Life,' while 'Best of Me' suffers the lowest opening ever for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation Thanks to an army of older males, David Ayer's Fury won the North American box office battle with $23.5 million from 3,173 theaters, toppling Gone Girl from the top spot and delivering one of the best openings of all time for a World War II war movie, not accounting for inflation. It's also another win for star Brad Pitt. Fury is a career best for Ayer. As fate would have it, the year's other high-profile WWII drama, the upcoming Unbroken, is directed by Pitt's wife, Angelina Jolie. Sony, QED International and LStar Capital spent $68 million to make Fury, featuring Pitt as a battle-hardened Army sergeant in command of a Sherman tank and its five-man crew as they attempt to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany (Sony is aggressively marketing the film to veterans). The film, earning an A- CinemaScore, also features Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal, Jason Isaacs and Scott Eastwood. While Fury played heavily to males (60 percent), Sony distribution chief Rory Bruer noted that females, likely lured in by Pitt, made up a healthy percentage. ""It's really resonating with all audiences,"" he said. Overall, 51 percent of the audience was over the age of 35. Strong reviews, along with the successful U.S. launch, should bolster Fury's showing overseas, where it begins rolling out next weekend. In 2009, Pitt starred in Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, which lays claim to the No. 2 opening of all time for a WWII war title ($38.1 million) after Pearl Harbor ($59.1 million). Fury ranks No. 4 behind those two titles and Saving Private Ryan ($30.6 million). Holdover Gone Girl — jumping the $100 million mark domestically and the $200 million mark globally — edged out new family entry Book of Life to take the No. 2 spot domesticaly (both are from 20th Century Fox). Gone Girl fell just 33 percent to $17.8 million from 3,241 theaters for a total $107.1 million. Overseas, Gone Girl took in another $20.2 million for a foreign cume of $94.7 million and worldwide haul of $201.8 million. By the end of Halloween weekend, Gone Girl will have surpassed The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ($127.5 million) to become Fincher's top film of all time in North America. Book of Life, produced by Guillermo del Toro and fueled by Hispanic moviegoers (40 percent), came in No. 3 with a solid $17 million from 3,071 theaters. Fox Animation and ReelFX co-produced the $50 million movie, voiced by Channing Tatum, Christina Applegate, Ice Cube, Hector Elizondo, Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana. The pic, set around the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead, likewise earned an A- CinemaScore. The 3D title skewed female (57 percent), while 54 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25, with many of those under the age of 10. ""The origins of the story are in Mexican folklore, so we targeted Hispanics, but we broadened the campaign to make it accessible for all audiences,"" said Fox domestic distribution president Chris Aronson. ""As for Gone Girl, it's a box office phenomenon. If you don't see the movie, you're not part of the conversation. And there is a whole lot of conversation going on."" Overseas, Book of Life debuted to $8.6 million from its first 19 markets, many of them in Latin America, for a global launch of $25.6 million. Mexico led with $3.8 million, followed by Brazil with $2 million. The weekend's third new nationwide offering was romancer The Best of Me, the latest adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel, starring Michelle Monaghan, James Marsden, Luke Bracey, Liana Liberato and Gerald McRaney. Best of Me placed No. 5 for the weekend with $10.2 million from 2,936 locations, the lowest debut for a Sparks adaptation, not accounting for inflation. The previous low was the $12.2 million debut of A Walk to Remember in 2002. Relativity partnered on the $26 million film with DiNovi Pictures and Nicholas Sparks Productions, and says its financial risk is minimal after selling off international rights and taking advantage of tax credits. Still, the $26 million budget doesn't include marketing costs. Best of Me, earning a B+ CinemaScore, came in behind Disney holdover Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, which took the No. 4 spot. ""We have had great success with Nicholas Sparks over the years and are always glad to be in business with him. We are confident the film will play well over the coming weeks given its word of mouth and strong CinemaScore,"" a Relativity spokesperson said. The company also worked with Sparks on Safe Haven and Dear John. Alejandro G. Inarritu's dark comedy Birdman soared at the specialty box office, earning $415,000 from four theaters in New York and Los Angeles for a whopping location average of $103,750, the second-best showing in two years after Wes Anderson's 2014 film The Grand Budapest Hotel ($202,792). Fox Searchlight and New Regency partnered on Birdman, starring Michael Keaton as a washed-up superhero-movie star who tries to reclaim his career by staging a play on Broadway. The awards contender also stars Edward Norton, Naomi Watts and Emma Stone. Roadside Attractions and Justin Simien's satirical dramedy Dear White People also prospered, earning $338,000 from 11 theaters in select markets for a location average of $30,702. The Wrap: Brad Pitt's ‘Fury’ Blitzes Box Office for $23.5 Million Win By Todd CunninghamOctober 19, 2014 The R-rated war saga ends “Gone Girl” streak. “Book of Life” is close third and “Best of Me” posts weakest Nicholas Sparks opening ever Brad Pitt‘s bloody war saga “Fury” rolled to a $23.5 million victory at the box office this weekend, ending the two-week run of the dark murder mystery “Gone Girl.” The Ben Affleck-starring thriller took in $17.8 million and edged another Fox release, “The Book of Life,” for second. The Guillermo del Toro-produced animated tale opened to $17 million. The weekend's other wide opener, the romance “The Best of Me,” fizzled with a $10.2 million debut — the worst-ever for a Nicholas Sparks adaptation. “Brad Pitt is a movie star,” Sony distribution chief Rory Bruer told TheWrap, “There's no doubt about that. But the camaraderie of the cast really pulled audiences in, and the story is so well told that people will be talking about this one.” Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña and Jon Bernthal co-star in the David Ayer-directed film. The opening didn't come close to that of the last film in which Pitt starred, the blockbuster “World War Z,” which debuted to $66 million last summer. And it didn't match “Inglourious Basterds,” another Pitt-starring war saga that opened to $38 million in 2009. But it topped the $22 million February opening of George Clooney's WWII tale “The Monuments Men,” and is easily Ayer's best debut. Selling a violent, R-rated tale of a U.S. tank team behind enemy lines in Nazi Germany is no small feat, and this is a solid start for the $68 million release from Sony, produced by QED International, LStar Capital, and Le Grisbi Productions/Crave Films. The audience for “Fury” included more women than might be expected — 40 percent — perhaps owing to Pitt's appeal. It also played younger than a WWII movie might be expected to, with nearly half the crowd under the age of 35. It received an “A-” CinemaScore, in line with the critics who have it at 80 percent positive on Rotten Tomatoes. “Fury” also received a big boost from Premium Large Format screens, which provided $3.5 million, or 15 percent of its grosses, an all-time high for PLF. It was a nice weekend for Fox, which had the No. 2 and 3 movies. “Gone Girl” held very strongly again – losing just 32 percent of its audience from last weekend – and is now up to $107 million. And this is a solid start for “The Book of Life.” The film from Reel FX Animation Studios, written and directed by Jorge Gutierrez , focused on Mexico's Day of the Dead, and got a big boost from Hispanic families. “This was a labor of love for Guillermo and Jorge and the voice cast (Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana, Channing Tatum and Christina Applegate), and that came through to audiences,” Fox's head of distribution Chris Aronson told TheWrap. Hispanics made up 30 percent of the audiences, which was 57 percent female and 54 percent under the age of 25. Moviegoers gave “The Best of Me,” starring Michelle Monaghan and James Marsden, a “B+” CinemaScore. That was much better than the critics, who have it at a dismal 7 percent positive on Rotten Tomatoes. But not enough Sparks fans turned out to prevent the ninth big-screen adaptation from the famed romance author to be his weakest debut ever, below the $12 million that “A Walk to Remember” opened with back in 2002. And it wasn't even half the $21 million that his last film, “Safe Haven,” opened with on Valentine's Day weekend last year. The production budget for “The Best of Me” was $26 million, but Relativity said that with pre-sales and tax credits, its exposure was limited to $5 million. It finished in fifth, behind Disney's family film “Alexander and Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day.” The comedy starring Steve Carell and Jennifer Garner held well in its second week, off just 35 percent, and brought in $12 million to up its domestic total to $38 million. Universal's “Dracula Untold” had a strong Saturday and wound up in sixth with $9.8 million, giving the monster reboot starring Luke Evans $40. 7 million after two weeks. Warner Bros.’ demon doll tale “Annabelle” scared up another $7.9 million and is now up to $74 million domestically and more than $150 million worldwide, making it the year's highest-grossing horror film. It was neck-and-neck with another Warner Bros. release, Robert Downey Jr.'s “The Judge. ” The courtroom drama co-starring Robert Duvall fell off just 39 percent in its second week, good news for the studio, which is hoping that mature audiences give it staying power. Sony's Denzel Washington action film “The Equalizer” was ninth with $5.4 million and is up to $89 million domestically after four weeks. Fox's “The Maze Runner” was tenth with $4.5 million and the young adult saga starring Dylan O'Brien has taken in more than $90 million domestically after five weeks. Deadline: Box Office Weekend: ‘Fury’ Wins War With $23M+; ‘Book Of Life,’ $16.6M to $17M; ‘Gone Girl’ $100M; ‘Best Of Me’ $10M+ By Anita BuschOctober 19, 2014 3rd UPDATE, Sunday, 8:17 AM: Fury won both the battle and the war this box office weekend while newcomers The Book of Life is sitting above ground at No. 3 with about $16.6M and The Best of Me got bested by four other films to take the fifth spot with only $10M and change. More interesting this weekend is the specialty box office where several really quality pictures found their audiences such as Birdman which flew in with a whopping $103K per screen average for Fox Searchlight and New Regency (on a roll lately as they also have the No. 2 Gone Girl which just passed $100M). It marks the second highest per screen average of the year behind another fav, Wes Anderson’s Grand Budapest Hotel ($202K), also from FSL. Writer/director Ted Melfi’s St. Vincent which is in limited release, can also boast a strong $10K for TWC and Chernin Entertainment (which is also churning out hits this year with Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). These two films are both getting some Oscar buzz. See the chart below following the Top Ten weekend’s grosses. Sony and QED can thank Brad Pitt for their weekend Fury as he boosted the attention of its war movie, written and directed well by fellow Midwesterner David Ayer (okay, we forgive you for bringing an aging Schwarzenegger back in Sabotage … on second thought, maybe not). This was a film that started out as a spec sale. Not any spec sale — QED International’s Bill Block bought it for a whopping $1M from Ayer last year and then went about getting a star to carry the film. Enter CAA who gave it to Pitt to read and viola! Lessening the weight of carrying the interest on $1M investment, this was a fast turnaround as Hollywood development goes … from the purchase in Feb. 2013, it was on the screen by Oct. 2014. Fury also gives Sony its third straight No. 1 opening this fall with The Equalizer and No Good Deed. It also was a record breaker for the PFL screens, grossing $3.5M or roughly 15% of the total that Fury has estimated to have grossed. How much this picture will perform around the world is anyone’s guess but with Pitt leading the charge of a strong supporting cast in Michael Pena, John Bernthal, Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, (to name a few), it should get some attention overseas. An A- CinemaScore usually carries with it an average of a 3.5 multiple so this could top out domestically at around $83M or better depending on the second weekend drop. They are about $150M all in with budget and marketing and distribution costs around the world. Lone Survivor made $149.2M with about 84% coming from international markets with Mark Wahlberg leading the troops. “We had some very good reviews here in the U.S., but the ones coming out of the UK have been as good if not better which I think bodes well for our openings that start, in earnest, next week,” said Sony’s president of worldwide distribution Rory Bruer. “David Ayer is a great storyteller and with this incredible cast led by Brad Pitt … they are so good together that they take you on an emotional journey through what is an action-packed story.” Fury‘s demos, not surprisingly, were 60% male and 40% female with a 49/51 split under and over 35 years of age, according to Sony. “Even though audience was more skewed to a male demo, I think the word of mouth is going to be great with the A- CinemaScore and the women will find this film,” said Bruer. The Book of Life is a very festive animated tale from Reel FX and Fox Animation set around the mythical Mexican story of the Dia de los Muertos (or Day of the Dead). It garnered a A- CinemaScore, too, on an opening of about $16.6M to $17M (we think the low end) which means his could end up around $60M domestically. We would expect a nice gross in certain territories around the globe like Mexico and Latin America based on producer Guillermo del Toro’s name alone. This one — which Fox says cost $50M — is from director Jorge Gutierrez was based on stories from his own family and came about because he had a friend who worked in the Dallas office of Reel FX who got Guillermo involved and they subsequently took it to Fox. This and Disney’s horribly long titled Alexander (etc. ad nauseum) should get some good play until Nov. 7 when Disney Animation’s Big Hero 6 bows. “It was a labor of love for Guillermo and Jorge, and I think it manifests itself in the amount of voice talent they were able to amass,” said Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution for Fox. Voice talent for this visual stunner (the detail is incredible) included Channing Tatum, Zoe Saldana, and Ice Cube, to name a few. “The themes of the movie are universal even though they are rooted in Mexican culture,” he added. The film’s demo make-up was 30% Hispanic (which is higher than the norm but very representative of the film’s story), 57% female and 43% male. Also, 54% was — not surprisingly — under 25 years old. Of the kids demo, 59% were under 10 years old. “The one constant, regardless of age or gender was that it was 4.5 stars all the way through with a very high definite recommend,” said Aronson. I saw it and concur; I would also recommend this fun film. Nicholas Sparks’ The Best of Me was originally optioned by DreamWorks before ending up at Relativity — which marks the third of the author’s work to go through the distributor (Safe Haven and Dear John). This one is said to have a budget of around $26M and due to pre-sales (both foreign and ancillary) and tax credits, Relativity’s exposure is only said to be around $5M. The film really had no big name YA stars in it — Michelle Monaghan (Source Code), James Marsden (X-Men, Enchanted), Luke Bracey (The November Man), Liana Liberato (If I Stay) and Gerald McRaney (Longmire). In their second weekends, Alexander (blah blah, etc. whatever) held well with a drop of only 34% to 37% and now sits atop a $43.5M worldwide gross while Universal’s Dracula Untold fell harder as most horror films do, down 59% but its right around $146M worldwide. The courtroom drama The Judge, which stars Robert Duvall and Robert Downey, Jr., dropped 40% and is now at a two-week cume of only about $26.8M domestically for Warner Bros. The chart follows … and I would be remiss not to thank our dilligent intern Amanda N’Duka for helping me this weekend. LA Times: 'Fury' pushes 'Gone Girl' from top spot at box office By Saba HamedyOctober 19, 2014 The new World War II film “Fury” starring Brad Pitt battled to the top of the weekend box office, pulling in an estimated $23.5 million in the U.S. and Canada and pushing “Gone Girl” out of the No. 1 spot. Strong reviews and word of mouth propelled ""Fury."" As of Sunday, the film had notched an 80% positive rating on review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes. It received an A-minus grade from audience polling firm CinemaScore. About 60% of the audience was male, and about 51% was older than 35. ""Fury,"" which was backed by Sony's Columbia Pictures with QED International and LStar Capital, cost about $68 million to make. “We’re so proud of this film…. It’s a really good start for us,” said Rory Bruer, distribution president for Sony Pictures. “It’s a film that’s going to provoke discussion, and I think people who would maybe not be the first on the list to go see a movie about war will be really blown away by it.” The David Ayer-directed film follows Sgt. Don Collier (Pitt), who leads a U.S. Army tank crew (played by Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Peña and Jon Bernthal) across Nazi-controlled Germany. Sony moved up the release date for the film, which was originally scheduled for Nov. 14, the weekend after Paramount's ""Interstellar"" and Disney's animated ""Big Hero 6"" are set to open. With its new release date, ""Fury"" topped George Clooney’s World War II film “The Monuments Men,” which opened to $22.7 million in February. But ""Fury"" lagged behind “Inglourious Basterds,” another Pitt-starring war film, which opened to about $38 million in 2009. ""It’s so important to have the emotion that goes with a war movie and the understanding that it’s not just about the action,” Bruer said. “There is a tremendous amount of action in 'Fury' -- it’s very visceral -- but on the other hand, it’s absolutely about camaraderie and family."" ""Gone Girl"" stayed strong in second place. The David Fincher thriller added $17.8 million to its gross, raising its total in the U.S. and Canada to about $107 million. Based on the novel by Gillian Flynn, the Fox drama follows Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) after his wife (Rosamund Pike) goes missing. So far, the film has wooed fans of Flynn, Fincher and Affleck as well as critics. It received a B grade from CinemaScore and an 88% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes. “It’s really become the water cooler movie,” said Chris Aronson, 20th Century Fox’s head of domestic distribution. Fox's new animated film, “The Book of Life,” opened to $17 million. The film, co-financed by Fox and Reel FX, cost about $50 million to make. The studio expected an opening weekend of $15 million to $20 million. Written and directed by Jorge Gutierrez, the animated film follows Manolo through a quest through different worlds to rescue his true love and defend his village. The PG-rated film is produced by Guillermo del Toro and voiced by a cast that includes Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube and Christina Applegate. “It was a labor of love for everyone that was involved,” Aronson said. “You could tell they really loved this project and it resonated across the board with audiences.” The film drew a 57% female audience, and about 54% of moviegoers were younger than 25. ""The Book of Life"" resonated especially well with Latino filmgoers, who made up 30% of the audience. It received an A-minus grade from CinemaScore and a 79% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes as of Sunday. In limited release, Fox Searchlight’s “Birdman” soared, grossing $415,000 in just four theaters. That per-location average of $103,750 was the second highest of the year, behind “The Grand Budapest Hotel” and ahead of “Boyhood.” The critically acclaimed film follows a washed up superhero actor (Michael Keaton) trying to get his mojo back with a Broadway play. “We are truly amazed and gratified at the reception that ‘Birdman’ has received so far,” read a statement from Frank Rodriguez, Fox Searchlight’s head of distribution. “And even though we knew people loved the film from its successful festival screenings, we still did not expect the picture to have the second highest per-screen average.” The film will expand to 18 new markets this Friday. “Dear White People,” Justin Simien's satire about race relations, also did well in limited release. It grossed $344,136 from 11 theaters for a per-screen average of $31,285. As of Sunday, the film had notched a 97% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Another new release, the adaption of the Nicholas Sparks book “The Best of Me,” didn’t fare as well as previous Sparks movies. The film, starring James Marsden and Michelle Monaghan, opened to $10.2 million. By comparison, “Dear John” starring Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried, opened in February 2010 to $32.4 million and displaced “Avatar” from the top of the charts. “Safe Haven,” which hit theaters on Valentine’s Day 2013, pocketed $34 million over a five-day holiday weekend. Though moviegoers flock to see romantic films for Valentine’s Day, had ""The Best of Me"" been slated for February, the film would have had to face competition from “Fifty Shades of Grey.” ""The Best of Me"" follows high-school sweethearts Dawson (Marsden) and Amanda (Monaghan), who reunite 20 years later for a friend's funeral. Before his death in November, Paul Walker had been cast in the role of Dawson. The film, which cost about $26 million to make, is the third Sparks adaptation for Relativity Media, which partnered with Sparks and Di Novi Pictures for this release. Because of pre-sales and tax credits, Relativity said, its exposure for the film is just $5 million. Though it notched a paltry 7% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the film did receive a B-plus grade from CinemaScore. It drew an audience that was about 70% female. ""We have had great success with Nicholas Sparks over the years and are always glad to be in business with him,” read a statement from Relativity. “We are confident the film will play well over the coming weeks given its word of mouth and strong CinemaScore.""",Private
"Memorandum To: DistributionFrom: Ileen Reich and Angela GalganiDate: October 2, 2014 RE: Fury / Screening Reactions #5Below, please find screening reactions on behalf of Fury. New reactions are in bold. Greg Ellwood/HITFIXGreg enjoyed the action scenes in the movie, but thought the script was lacking. He though that Brad made the most of his role and gave a great performance with a character that wasn’t deeply written. He thought the DP, sound and production designers all could get nominations. He felt Logan Lerman had a shot for Best Supporting Actor. David Poland/MOVIE CITY NEWSDavid said he cannot stop thinking about Fury. He said, “this movie is so incredibly current. It's about so many things that resonate right now and the best war movie in 30 years that's really about war. He can’t wait to see it again. He added, “the Oscar race is now on. There is finally a best picture. A REAL movie. Why have you been hiding this film, it's ridiculously amazing. It is better than any of the other movies I thought were the best picture (Birdman, Boyhood and definitely better than Gone Girl or the films from Toronto).I think the narrative that all the press is hoping will play out — could. If Angelina's movie lives up to the hype, it could be Brad against Angie.” Michael Cieply/THE NEW YORK TIMES“Fury is every bit as good as I figured it would be. Very tough, but really good. Best part is, my wife liked it, and she's a much tougher audience for this one. I'm pulling together a kind of reported essay on the three looming World War II movies, Fury, The Imitation Game, and Unbroken. Nothing elaborate; just trying to explain that they all have radically different takes on what prevailed: Guts, brains, spirit. Fury is guts in this equation. “ Ethan Alter/FILM JOURNALEthan said that overall he would give the film a B. He said he was mixed on the film when it comes to the story, but he thought that the visuals were quite striking. He thought the action sequences--particularly that one tank battle with the three American tanks against the one German tank--were very well executed and that David Ayer did a nice job capturing the inside-the-tank dynamics amongst the five men. Of the cast, Jon Bernthal struck him as a key standout. He did feel that the narrative dragged at times. Neil Goldman/CHARLIE ROSENeil enjoyed the film, but he did have some criticisms to share. He feels the camera shots are interesting and at 2 hours 15 minutes, the movie moves. He said the acting is great and that Jon Bernthal steals the show. Neil feels that even though the explosions get repetitive, Brad Pitt holds the film together and the film feels authentic. Two scenes that Neil thinks are incredibly gripping are Norman resisting Brad Pitt's order to kill the German officer and Norman and Brad Pitt's dinner with the German women and their drunken American tank mates crashing the meal. Neil thinks some of the shots in the movie are beautiful like “the men draped over the tank coming at us with the backdrop of a barren landscape; the neon light show of artillery fire, etc.” He said that you definitely get a sense of the camaraderie of tankers…”the banter, the horseplay, the claustrophobia, the differences of opinion and belief that bump up against each other because four men are housed so tightly together, the anger/resentment, (Norman & Brad Pitt's early beef, Norman's fighting with Jon Bernthal's character), but also the love that exists between them.” Neil is questioning what the movie is ultimately about and feels that none of the themes are fully explored. He didn't find it to be a particularly smart movie or leave much to talk about afterwards. Further, Neil thought it was unrealistic that the SS guard would allow one of them to get away at the end of the movie. But ultimately, Neil said FURY is not a bad way to spend 2 hrs 15 minutes if you're looking for some entertainment.” Lynn Hirschberg/WLynn liked the film, but wasn’t blown away by it. She said it was quite an experience and an exhausting film. Ultimately, she commented that it is really an oppressive anti-war film and by the end you end up asking “Why, why, why” which is very powerful. Brad Pitt is the best thing in the film and its heart and soul – if you take him out there would be a problem. He took what is on the page and really made it meaningful, it is clearly a very deep and personal performance and it is unlike anything he has done in previous roles – Wardaddy is a lost soul. He could get a nomination even in such a crowded year for actors. The other cast was good, though they weren’t given enough to do. It really is Brad Pitt’s show. Logan Lerman was better than he usually is in a somewhat clichéd character. Shia LaBeouf was very good. Lynn wished that there was some more back story to the characters. John Anderson/NEWSDAYJohn thought the film was fantastic and said he thinks Brad Pitt could get a nomination though it will be tough given how crowded the actor field is this year. He also said that he “wouldn’t be surprised if the film could be considered quite controversial given that virtually everyone is psychotic, the war-glory BS is completely debunked and the close to rape sequence is like nothing I’ve seen in American film.” Missy Schwartz/ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLYMissy liked the film a lot, though she did feel it was a hard movie to figure out (clearly, David Ayer is saying a lot). Everyone was really good and Brad Pitt was excellent. She really believed him as Wardaddy. Shia LaBeouf was terrific. Unfortunately, she found the pivotal role of Norman underwritten and she was not totally onboard with him. Though important, she felt the apartment scene was a bit long. It is always challenging to make a film which is almost all battle sequences but she believed everything in FURY – all the guys were in it for the long haul, how fast transform in war the do or die mentality. As an audience, people are so trained to have some sort of happy ending and Missy said the film works so well because by the end it is truly devastating with everyone dying, really showing the trials and tribulation of war. The exhaustion of the characters which wears down on the soul is felt by the audience and is very effective. Rich Turner/WALL STREET JOURNALRich liked the film and thinks it will do quite well. Michael Arbeiter/NY DAILY NEWSMichael liked the film and thought the dynamic of the five guys was especially impressive. Samantha Miller/PEOPLESamantha liked the film and commented that the acting across the board was excellent. She said it is very well-made and all the action was very clear and visceral. She thought the film was intense and she liked the Howard Hawks/Sam Peckinpah male bonding vibe. She didn’t care for the score. Kara Warner/FREELANCE/SCREENRANT.COM/PLAYBOY.COMKara thought there is a LOT of great in the movie - the visuals, the tanks, the battle sequences, the acting - all of those elements are so satisfying. She said the one thing she couldn’t wrap her head around is the story. She said it almost pulls you in enough to fall in love with the guys and their tank family, but just doesn't quite get there. She commented it is beautifully shot and acted. Krista Smith/ VANITY FAIR (additional reaction)Krista thought it was so great to see Brad Pitt carry a movie again. She thought his performance was fantastic. She said that ironically for her, the freshness from the film was Shia LaBeouf. He is the heart of the movie. She liked that God was his justification for what they’re doing. She found that part fascinating, where she wanted to see more of that from the other characters. She would have been fine with 10 or 15 more minutes added to the movie if it allowed her to become better acquainted with each character. She loved the action and the realness of the film; however, she felt the script was lacking and there wasn’t much freshness to it. For instance, she didn’t understand the “Best Job I ever had” line. While she thought Logan Lerman’s character was phenomenal, she felt that Jon Bernthal’s character was reduced to a caricature and that Michael Pen’s character felt too modern. She thought that perhaps it was the dialogue written for him, but it didn’t feel like he was from 1945. As for the ending scene, she found it rather unbelievable. While the film felt so realistic throughout its entirety, she thought that Norman should have either been killed by the German soldier or had the savvy to survive. For her, it seemed unrealistic that the German soldier was willing to spare Norman’s life after he and the four other guys mauled down almost 300 Nazis. All-in-all, she thinks the movie will do very well commercially because it’s Brad Pitt. Currently, she is undecided on a best picture nomination.. she can’t completely rule it out. For Golden Globes, she thinks Brad Pitt and the film will definitely receive nominations. She would give the film a solid B+. Krista really liked the movie. She said she “wanted more of it.” Not more of the violence, but more of the story. She thought that Shia LaBeouf’s performance was fantastic. She did think Brad Pitt was great and really liked the scene in the apartment with the girls. Elena Howe/ LA TIMESElena said she liked the film a lot. However, she said it wasn’t quite as unique of a story as she had expected. She did say it was gripping and well acted. She thinks the film is worthy of some Oscar campaigning but didn’t elaborate any further. Elena added: “I think Logan Lerman in supporting for sure, Brad Pitt for lead… picture and director might be worthwhile as well given that there’s no clear frontrunner yet.” Jane Sarkin / VANITY FAIRJane loved the film and Brad Pitt. She said all of the performances are perfect and Logan Lerman is a revelation. The battle scenes are long and intense which are very important yet unpleasant. Lisa Hintelmann / ESQUIREAlthough this is not Lisa’s favorite genre, she did like the film and thought that Brad Pitt was terrific – it is a very complex character and he does an incredible job showing all of the varying traits: he is both brutal and tender at the same time; a father figure of sorts but not in an overbearing or clichéd way. Though she liked the supporting performances none of them stood out for her. The film is very well done and David Ayer does a great job at making a very intimate film about a very big thing and it works very well. The battle scenes are extremely visceral bringing the audience right to the frontlines of the war. She said the strongest scene is the apartment scene and she loved Alicia von Rittberg as Emma saying she reminded her of Abbie Cornish and Lea Seydoux. Lisa is a huge fan of End of Watch and how real and deep the relationship between Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhaal is and hoped to see that in Fury. Unfortunately, though they speak of it throughout the film, she never truly got the feeling of camaraderie between the guys in the tank and she had hoped to. Andrea Oliveri / DETAILSAndrea liked FURY and felt that it was a solid B+/A-. In addition to the performances, the cinematography, editing and effects were all top notch. She thought though the beginning was a bit slow, the story was strong and really picked up once Logan’s character was introduced. She said at first it seemed like a varied mix with the supporting actors, but she felt they all worked really well together which cements the fact that Brad Pitt is an amazing actor. Andrea commented that Shia LaBeouf is immensely talented and she LOVED Jon Bernthal. She also felt that Logan Lerman has such a great range and was extremely believable. Logan Lerman’s first shooting scene was a favorite as was Shia LaBeouf praying with the dying soldier. She loved the scene with the women in the German house – you really understood Wardaddy’s role in the story and how protective he was of Norman. She felt the tension was great when the rest of the squad came in drunk. All of the relationships in the film are complicated and interesting especially the brotherly bond between Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena and Shia LaBeouf -- and Brad Pitt definitely inhabited the role of Wardaddy. Andrea loved that he looked older and weathered which made him even more believable in the role. Kathy Heintzelman / FREELANCEKathy said she would count herself as a David Ayer fan – she really liked End of Watch. She thought Fury was well done, overall but it wasn't her favorite film this year. She would give the film a B. She said got very mixed messages from it -- and maybe that's realistic and commendable, but it felt a little manipulative to her. For example, a lot of it sends the ""war is hell"" message, but by the final standoff, with the swelling music, it seemed like this was the greatest job and the greatest camaraderie these guys were ever going to have (they even say as much). “Maybe that's the way battle really is, I don't know; or maybe that's the way it felt to the Greatest Generation in a war where there was a much clearer sense of good and evil.” But she thought it undercut the moral dilemmas the young newbie was wrestling with in the first half of the film. To her there were two standout sequences -- the one where the two tanks are battling each other, and the one in the house in the German town with the two women. In the tank sequence, she was really engaged with the mechanics of the battle in ways she wasn't during the final sequence. And the German town scene was just... weird in an interesting way. She couldn't quite buy that the other guys from the tank would be that harassing when their chief was clearly upset by their behavior. Or why he didn't just tell them to knock it off. Kathy didn't understand the dynamics there, but it was interesting and a nice break from battle scenes. The way the gunshots were indicated with colored laser-like bursts distracted her-- she felt it seemed cartoonish or video-game-ish. Kathy did mention for all she knows that's the way it really looks on the battlefield, but again, it sent a kind of mixed message. Kathy liked the acting although thought the characters were sort of stock. What happened with the newbie seemed obvious from the beginning -- if he didn't die early on he'd end up the way he did. And, it was hard to forget that that was Brad Pitt -- no fault of his acting, but he was a figurehead or symbol more than an actual character. She wouldn't have minded learning a little more about him and some of the others, but, that's a staple of old WWII movies that Ayer avoided. Although she would have liked just a little more. Pete Hammond/Deadline HollywoodPete said he could not believe how good the film was. He mentioned he is a big David Ayer fan. He thought all the performances were great, especially Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. “Do not count out Brad Pitt this year . “ He said the film is definitely in the Best Picture race -- especially a push for all of the crafts and not to forget that the Academy loves a war movie. Roger Durling/Executive Director Santa Barbara Film FestivalRoger was visibly moved and completely shaken after the screening, and on the spot invited the film to screen at the Festival’s Cinema Society. He said the film had so much humanity and there was never a false note. He loved the authenticity and texture of the film and was very inquisitive about how it was shot. He was a fan of both Logan Lerman and Brad Pitt’s performances and noted it was career shifting role for Shia (in light of his recent press). He was incredibly enthusiastic in his reaction. Timothy Blake/President of SAG Film SocietyShe said it was an incredible ensemble performance. It was all about the work-it was all up there on the screen. Everyone one of the actors gave an amazing performance. She feels that Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman were standouts and gave Award caliber performances. Going in she felt this would skew more male, but after seeing it, and they way she personally felt, she feels women will respond to it as well. She thinks the film has a good chance to be nominated for SAG ensemble. Tim Gray/VarietyHe thinks this is a new level of achievement for Brad Pitt. He is a big supporter of the film. Especially noted the Cinematography and Steven Price’s score. Peter Travers/ Rolling StonePeter really liked the movie. He thinks we are a lock for Logan Lerman in supporting and we should be able to get one of the Best Picture slots. He thought the film had excellent below the line chances, as well. He thought Brad Pitt was fantastic, but reminded us, the lead category is just very competitive this year. Peter felt David Ayer did a terrific job at showing the humanity in war. He loved the dinner scene and loved that the German soldier didn’t kill Logan at the end. Peter expected the movie to be much more gratuitous, but was pleased it was not. To him if felt very human, very emotional and very real. He felt you don’t leave the film feeling despondent -- you actually feel like things happened for a reason. He said the film moved at a swift pace and held his interest throughout. Dave Karger/FANDANGODave enjoyed the movie and said that it would be included in his top 15 picks of the year, but not yet in his top 10. He thought it was a B+ film if he were rating it. He thought the performances were powerful, but noted that this is a very strong year for males and it will be tough for actor nominations. Dave said that the film started a little slow for him, but once they got into the apartment with the two women, it took off and he was emotionally invested. He said that the film could have a below-the-line push for the crafts categories. Elvis Mitchell/INTERVIEWElvis thought the scene in the house is an extraordinary sequence. He said that while it seems digressive, it's completely pushing the story forward in emotional and narrative terms and we know who each of those guys are in that house. He thought it is refreshing to see a movie in which tension is subject of a movie in the most subtle way possible, and in which PTSD is illustrated as texture rather than declaimed as a story point.",Private
"Memorandum To: DistributionFrom: Ileen Reich and Angela GalganiDate: October 6, 2014 RE: Fury / Screening Reactions #6Below, please find screening reactions on behalf of Fury. New reactions are in bold. Jeff Wells/HOLLYWOOD ELSEWHEREJeff said that the film is, ""Filled with a good amount of exciting, jolting verisimilitude. Otherwise forget it."" ""It's good, it's not great. It's strong when it's strong, but otherwise it's....weird?"" He did not care for the extended domestic sequence with the two German women, which he thought went on too long. Jeff said he felt like the ""Wild Bunch finale"" didn't make sense to him because in his words, ""they weren't trapped, they could have run for the trees,"" but chose not to. He said it was a case of Nihilism, pure and simple. ""Fury is very strong in some respects -- great battle verisimilitude -- but ultimately thought it was too nihilistic.” Kris Tapley/HITFIXKris said “I kind of loved a lot of it. It feels like he bit off more than he could chew but it's fascinating watching all the ideas bounce around. That scene with the German girls is kind of amazing. Reminded me of the French plantation sequence in ‘Apocalypse Now Redux.’ I wonder about Oscars. I'm not squeamish about this stuff, strangely (as in war trauma in movies), but even I thought it probably leaned too heavily on that. After a while it's sort of numbing. That could be difficult with that crowd. Opening scene is really awesome intro to the crew. I've heard of a bunch of stuff that they took out of the movie but it sounds like they stripped away exactly what they needed to. I dug it.” Greg Ellwood/HITFIXGreg enjoyed the action scenes in the movie, but thought the script was lacking. He though that Brad made the most of his role and gave a great performance with a character that wasn’t deeply written. He thought the DP, sound and production designers all could get nominations. He felt Logan Lerman had a shot for Best Supporting Actor. David Poland/MOVIE CITY NEWSDavid said he cannot stop thinking about Fury. He said, “this movie is so incredibly current. It's about so many things that resonate right now and the best war movie in 30 years that's really about war. He can’t wait to see it again. He added, “the Oscar race is now on. There is finally a best picture. A REAL movie. Why have you been hiding this film, it's ridiculously amazing. It is better than any of the other movies I thought were the best picture (Birdman, Boyhood and definitely better than Gone Girl or the films from Toronto).I think the narrative that all the press is hoping will play out — could. If Angelina's movie lives up to the hype, it could be Brad against Angie.” Michael Cieply/THE NEW YORK TIMES“Fury is every bit as good as I figured it would be. Very tough, but really good. Best part is, my wife liked it, and she's a much tougher audience for this one. I'm pulling together a kind of reported essay on the three looming World War II movies, Fury, The Imitation Game, and Unbroken. Nothing elaborate; just trying to explain that they all have radically different takes on what prevailed: Guts, brains, spirit. Fury is guts in this equation. “ Ethan Alter/FILM JOURNALEthan said that overall he would give the film a B. He said he was mixed on the film when it comes to the story, but he thought that the visuals were quite striking. He thought the action sequences--particularly that one tank battle with the three American tanks against the one German tank--were very well executed and that David Ayer did a nice job capturing the inside-the-tank dynamics amongst the five men. Of the cast, Jon Bernthal struck him as a key standout. He did feel that the narrative dragged at times. Neil Goldman/CHARLIE ROSENeil enjoyed the film, but he did have some criticisms to share. He feels the camera shots are interesting and at 2 hours 15 minutes, the movie moves. He said the acting is great and that Jon Bernthal steals the show. Neil feels that even though the explosions get repetitive, Brad Pitt holds the film together and the film feels authentic. Two scenes that Neil thinks are incredibly gripping are Norman resisting Brad Pitt's order to kill the German officer and Norman and Brad Pitt's dinner with the German women and their drunken American tank mates crashing the meal. Neil thinks some of the shots in the movie are beautiful like “the men draped over the tank coming at us with the backdrop of a barren landscape; the neon light show of artillery fire, etc.” He said that you definitely get a sense of the camaraderie of tankers…”the banter, the horseplay, the claustrophobia, the differences of opinion and belief that bump up against each other because four men are housed so tightly together, the anger/resentment, (Norman & Brad Pitt's early beef, Norman's fighting with Jon Bernthal's character), but also the love that exists between them.” Neil is questioning what the movie is ultimately about and feels that none of the themes are fully explored. He didn't find it to be a particularly smart movie or leave much to talk about afterwards. Further, Neil thought it was unrealistic that the SS guard would allow one of them to get away at the end of the movie. But ultimately, Neil said FURY is not a bad way to spend 2 hrs 15 minutes if you're looking for some entertainment.” Lynn Hirschberg/WLynn liked the film, but wasn’t blown away by it. She said it was quite an experience and an exhausting film. Ultimately, she commented that it is really an oppressive anti-war film and by the end you end up asking “Why, why, why” which is very powerful. Brad Pitt is the best thing in the film and its heart and soul – if you take him out there would be a problem. He took what is on the page and really made it meaningful, it is clearly a very deep and personal performance and it is unlike anything he has done in previous roles – Wardaddy is a lost soul. He could get a nomination even in such a crowded year for actors. The other cast was good, though they weren’t given enough to do. It really is Brad Pitt’s show. Logan Lerman was better than he usually is in a somewhat clichéd character. Shia LaBeouf was very good. Lynn wished that there was some more back story to the characters. John Anderson/NEWSDAYJohn thought the film was fantastic and said he thinks Brad Pitt could get a nomination though it will be tough given how crowded the actor field is this year. He also said that he “wouldn’t be surprised if the film could be considered quite controversial given that virtually everyone is psychotic, the war-glory BS is completely debunked and the close to rape sequence is like nothing I’ve seen in American film.” Missy Schwartz/ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLYMissy liked the film a lot, though she did feel it was a hard movie to figure out (clearly, David Ayer is saying a lot). Everyone was really good and Brad Pitt was excellent. She really believed him as Wardaddy. Shia LaBeouf was terrific. Unfortunately, she found the pivotal role of Norman underwritten and she was not totally onboard with him. Though important, she felt the apartment scene was a bit long. It is always challenging to make a film which is almost all battle sequences but she believed everything in FURY – all the guys were in it for the long haul, how fast transform in war the do or die mentality. As an audience, people are so trained to have some sort of happy ending and Missy said the film works so well because by the end it is truly devastating with everyone dying, really showing the trials and tribulation of war. The exhaustion of the characters which wears down on the soul is felt by the audience and is very effective. Rich Turner/WALL STREET JOURNALRich liked the film and thinks it will do quite well. Michael Arbeiter/NY DAILY NEWSMichael liked the film and thought the dynamic of the five guys was especially impressive. Samantha Miller/PEOPLESamantha liked the film and commented that the acting across the board was excellent. She said it is very well-made and all the action was very clear and visceral. She thought the film was intense and she liked the Howard Hawks/Sam Peckinpah male bonding vibe. She didn’t care for the score. Kara Warner/FREELANCE/SCREENRANT.COM/PLAYBOY.COMKara thought there is a LOT of great in the movie - the visuals, the tanks, the battle sequences, the acting - all of those elements are so satisfying. She said the one thing she couldn’t wrap her head around is the story. She said it almost pulls you in enough to fall in love with the guys and their tank family, but just doesn't quite get there. She commented it is beautifully shot and acted. Krista Smith/ VANITY FAIR (additional reaction)Krista thought it was so great to see Brad Pitt carry a movie again. She thought his performance was fantastic. She said that ironically for her, the freshness from the film was Shia LaBeouf. He is the heart of the movie. She liked that God was his justification for what they’re doing. She found that part fascinating, where she wanted to see more of that from the other characters. She would have been fine with 10 or 15 more minutes added to the movie if it allowed her to become better acquainted with each character. She loved the action and the realness of the film; however, she felt the script was lacking and there wasn’t much freshness to it. For instance, she didn’t understand the “Best Job I ever had” line. While she thought Logan Lerman’s character was phenomenal, she felt that Jon Bernthal’s character was reduced to a caricature and that Michael Pen’s character felt too modern. She thought that perhaps it was the dialogue written for him, but it didn’t feel like he was from 1945. As for the ending scene, she found it rather unbelievable. While the film felt so realistic throughout its entirety, she thought that Norman should have either been killed by the German soldier or had the savvy to survive. For her, it seemed unrealistic that the German soldier was willing to spare Norman’s life after he and the four other guys mauled down almost 300 Nazis. All-in-all, she thinks the movie will do very well commercially because it’s Brad Pitt. Currently, she is undecided on a best picture nomination.. she can’t completely rule it out. For Golden Globes, she thinks Brad Pitt and the film will definitely receive nominations. She would give the film a solid B+. Krista really liked the movie.

"Please find below review snapshots for Fury. The reviews average out to be in the 3-4 star range (with only one reviewer giving it a low score of 1.5 stars). The Herald Sun/Courier Mail/Daily Telegraph/Advertiser, Leigh Paatsch- 3.5 stars….a brutally basic war picture.No flashy gimmicks, no distractions, no unnecessary contrivances. If you like your military combat cut through with outlandish humour or historically verified heroics, you’ve come to the wrong movie. These narrow storytelling parameters give Fury a near-biblical simplicity that goes quaintly, yet bravely against the grain of a majority of the war movies of today.Pitt gives off both the charisma and the commitment needed to make the movie matter when it should, and his fellow cast members wisely follow his lead.Fury is a tough viewing experience. And also, a telling one. The Sydney Morning Herald/The Age Melbourne, Jake Wilson- 1.5 starsThose who dislike the use of handheld camera work to evoke the frenzy of war should be gratified by Fury ....the film has the feel of a hyper-realistic video game, with tracer bullets flashing past like lasers and tons of graphic gore; but while heads are blown off and bodies squashed in the mud, at least the camera stays on its tripod.In other respects, too, writer-director David Ayer ensures we keep our bearings. The set-up is one you've seen a million times…Little of the dramatic material is convincing, in part because Pitt – who was very funny in Quentin Tarantino's World War II burlesque Inglourious Basterds – retains a kind of preening inwardness far removed from the matter-of-fact authority associated with, say, Lee Marvin. But seemingly Ayer wants us to accept this hokey father-son stuff at face value: at most, he's content to reaffirm the traditional paradox whereby war is both a hellish experience of moral degradation and a glorious opportunity for bonding between men. At The Movies, David Stratton- 2.5 stars out of 5FURY is a rather infuriating film. Unlike, say, Quentin Tarantino who also starred Brad Pitt in a World War II movie, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, and had fun with it, you could hardly describe anything about this film as fun. It's true that many of the action scenes are very well staged, and that the scene in which Collier and Norman visit the apartment of a couple of German women is filled with tension, but the film suffers from the fact that none of the characters is given anything in the way of a back story - we know nothing about them, and so it's hard to care about them, even when they do an unlikely 300 Spartans for the film's protracted climax. In addition, much of the heavily-accented dialogue is pretty incomprehensible. At The Movies, Margaret Pomeranz- 3 stars out of 5 The Today Show, Richard Wilkins- 4 starsBrad Pitt is absolutely incredible. Filmink Magazine, Erin Free- 15 out of 20… Ayer determinedly rubs the audience’s nose in all of its sweat, blood, and viscera, as if to say, “This is what it’s really about.” That’s a worthy sentiment and a strong point of intent, but it also makes for an almost unbearably grim viewing experience. Even war films like Saving Private Ryan andFull Metal Jacket were leavened by moments of warmth, humour, or hope, but Fury has no interest in cutting anyone this sort of slack. It’s mean, nasty, and apocalyptically violent, but it also grabs you bodily and refuses to let go until it’s literally strangled and beaten the life out of you. Fury is an ingeniously and creatively mounted film, built on an admirable and rarely seen lack of compromise, but it’s a big, bloody ask. Fun? Hardly. Forgettable? Absolutely not. Online/bloggers Saltypopcorn.com, Jason KingI am glad that FURY was the first tank film I have seen, because it has set a benchmark that I will never forget. FURY is an incredibly horrific, realistic, gritty look at the horror of World War Two and the awful brutality of man. Artshub.com.au, Sarah Ward- 3 stars out of 5Maintaining the feature’s intense obsession with all things cruelly fleeting, each cycle of ruthlessness and reflection passes, though not without leaving an imprint. Fury is marked by its smattering of astute, affecting moments. They’re the glue that stops the gore-filled affronts from collapsing into the usual over-the-top war clichés…Each actor, be it Pitt in his muscular command, LeBeouf displaying uncharacteristic solemnity, or Lerman’s fearful naivety, sparkles in small showings rather than complete arcs. Select shots, specifically those favouring the point-of-view perspective, evoke the inherent sadness and senselessness of the situation. The sentiment and relationships may be obvious, just as much as its action and on-screen personalities have been seen before, but in its glimpses of resonance beyond the heightened realism, Fury achieves what its characters seek – it endures.Fliks.com.au, Steve Newall- 4 starsLed by a convincingly compelling Brad Pitt, dialling down his Inglourious Basterds performance by about 2%, they’re a believable unit, if comprising the stereotypes you’d expect. To Fury’s credit, the film rises above the obvious, particularly in the form of wide-eyed new recruit Logan Lerman, through whose eyes we’re introduced to the horrors of war.Is there a huge amount of character development? Not really. Do we come to see the Germans as characters in their own right? Nope. But with any luck you’ll be swept away like I was as Fury gives you the jitters, a superior war film that doesn’t shirk from sudden, shocking violence but still doesn’t overplay its hand when it comes to man’s inhumanity to man. Spotlightreport.net, Jorge Duran…a non-stop war drama with impressive action sequences, strong performances, flawless special effects, gripping drama, crude moments and a stunning cinematography that can be only compared with the likes of Saving Private Ryan and the magnificent TV drama, Band of Brothers.Fury manages to amaze every minute, with its perfect balance of drama and action, allowing for the development of each of the characters, as they create strong bonds and engage in minor rivalries. Brad Pitt is at his best….Thus, performance-wise the film is impeccable; and it is this, along with the marvellous cinematography that makes Fury a cinematic triumph. The subtle camera moves and great photography add to the realism. Overall, Fury is an impeccable war drama, and one of the strongest films of 2014, that is sure to be included in next year’s Academy Award nominations. A must watch film! Weekend Notes, Kevin LiepinsA World War II movie in 2014? You bet. If all action war movies are your thing - Fury is the ultimate.Set literally in the dying embers of the war, it tells the story of a war weary sergeant named Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) who commands a Sherman tank and its five-man crew. They are sent deep into enemy lines in Nazi Germany in what seems like hopeless assignments.Brad Pitt is in full glory living up to his name as the macho war daddy in charge of his crew including the young novice Norman drafted in unwillingly from the army administrative pool.It's a bleak and confronting movie that is at times harrowing with blood and gore and a body count that goes off the Richter scale. There is some fine acting and action scenes with a highlight a tank battle.It's not a movie for everyone – particularly not a romantic first date - but those that do enjoy Brad Pitt and war action movies will come away satisfied.At plus two hours in length you may feel like you come out of the cinema war weary yourself with PTWMS (Post Traumatic War Movie Syndrome)! Urban Cinefile, Louise Keller David Ayer's film succeeds in creating a claustrophobic mood….. although the characterisations might have been better described. The dialogue might have been easier to understand, too.Fury is a gritty, realistic war drama that emphases the horrors, futility and devastation of war only too well. It is almost like being there. Urban Cinefile, Andrew L. UrbanBrilliantly supported by Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal and Logan Lerman...the film strikes me as being not only derivative, with predictable encounters and the usual menu of character tensions, but also manipulative and at times shallow. Annoyingly, it also suffers from what seems to be current Hollywood sound mixing fashion - you know, the one which obliterates most of the dialogue through a combination of mumbled, accented speech of the characters and cowboy sound mixers who like to ride the M&E tracks in favour of (bass-heavy) dialogue.There is impressive cinematic craftsmanship, though, with outstanding cinematography, music and design, and if not exhausted by it, audiences will be at least partly satisfied - whether they heard what was said or not.",Private

"Steven,Please find below and attached the updated reactions to FURY. Additions since the previous chart are shown in red. These reactions are to the original DCP issued. I am currently liaising with Vince to see when a DCP of the soon-to-be-locked version will be available to send to the territories. Best,NigelFURY DCP Screening ReactionsMARKETREACTIONSArgentinaWe all really enjoyed the movie here in Argentina, we think the actors' performances were great and it has a solid plot. We expect a 16 censorship. Considering the target of the movie, we believe this censorship shouldn't be a problem.Our estimate numbers are: GBO LC 7M (US$ 850K)Revenue LC 2,748,112 (US$ 335K)ADPub LC 1.2M (US$ 146K)Print Cost: LC554K (US$ 67K) 65 ScreensAustraliaA powerful war drama….that resonated best with males in the team and to an okay-modest reaction from the female members. It was tough & raw at times, necessarily so with war films …and consequently will attract a restricted ‘MA’-15 years rating level. (It is at the top end of our MA classification…but assume some of the blood splatter effects may be toned down in the final version…and for the USA to get an R-version). All envisaged a tighter version to come…and a shorter running time.Acting & characters were top shelf….Brad & Shia were outstanding as were all of the ‘tank crew’. There was perhaps less action than expected but the critical tank engagement scenes were riveting.There was less of a storyline arc & hence emotional involvement than say, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN….but it’s commercial strength lies with Brad Pitt leading, fans of war movies and strong cast performances. Commercial up-side will depend on Award noms and very strong critic reaction.EstimatesRelease date: November 27, 2014.GBO LC$8 million / USD7.5 millionRentals LC$3.2 millionAd/Pub LC$2 millionPrints 200+ Comparable Films Title Release Date Rating G.B.O.

But we think that women, who admire especially Brad Pitt (who is obviousely the star ) , will not go see this movie with all those violent scenes and also therefore the target group is very small.BelgiumWe've seen a mighty movie. We've admired the acting of Brat Pitt, Shea LeBeouf, Logan Lerman…the movie drags one along into mud, through a journey of violence and madness of war. Probably 1 of the most realistic war movies ever made who will leave audiences with many questions. Impossible to not talk about it afterwards._War and it's atrocities become a daily topic on every news these days, with conflicts in the middle East etc., as a result audiences might want to avoid 'war again' in cinemas.FURY is set at the end of WW2; this year the whole of Europe remembers (100 years) WW1 (14-18) with all year round large scale memory happenings aired on t.v. etc. The subject is likely to attract older audiences and mostly men. +Brad Pitt in a leading role supported by a great cast and director. The movie will probably be well reviewed. Print nbr : +/- 45 (expect best results in urban locations)Ad/pub : 350.000€BOG : 1.200.000€Brazil DenmarkFury 2 WW drama could be compared with the German Das Boot intense, good drama and no happy end.Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers are also good comps. The reaction from the team was good , with the girls feeling a little sad at the end. When it comes to estimate I added numbers in interplan and our estimate is kr. 7.mill.FranceVery well made movie. The war scenes which represent 90% of the movie are very powerful and captivating. Filming into the tank really gives the measure and the intensity of what the crew is experiencing. The last battle is great but maybe too long and a little unrealistic, but I’m sure it will be a fantastic scene if it is shortened a little bit.Our biggest concern is about the scene with the German ladies. It is a very important scene as it is the only one which doesn’t happen on the battlefield, and we didn’t find it very realistic and very well made. The girl singing while the soldier is playing piano, and everybody’s behavior when the rest of the crew arrives in the apartment, seemed odd to everyone attending the screening.Otherwise, actors are very good and the relationship between the soldiers is excellent, and , again the war scenes are very well made.GBO estimate: 5.6M€GermanyNo doubt, FURY is a film with 5 excellent actors who perform absolutely compelling, headed by a brilliant Brad Pitt in an unusual role. However, we are facing some challenges with this film. The target group is hard to define – we won´t get the young males (they see films like TF4 or Guardians of the Galaxy), very likely no females as it is very / too violent (which might get us the 16) – and for the older audience it doesn´t really have a new approach to the darkest part of our history as e.g. INGL. BASTERDS had which made this film so special, even for Germans. Apart from this, it is definitely too long. This is the reason we drastically had to reduce our original Estimates which was given us from Home Office last year in London – and we would also suggest to reduce our Ad/Pub. GERMANY: B.O.: 2.625.000 Euro Rev.: 1.050.000 Euro Prints: 250Ad/pub: 1.200.000 Euro (instead of 2.2 !!)MexicoA very graphically explicit incredibly well made world war II movie. Very reminiscent of past Hollywood war movies. The acting was superb and all accounts.Possible Oscar alley potential. Hence we recommend release date of January 09.GBO Estimate: $40,000,000Ad/Pub Estimate: $4,500,000No. Prints: 200No. Screens: 230NetherlandsWe screened FURY today. It is an impressive, raw and ultra-violent war movie. Brad Pitt is strong, we were pleasantly surprised by the performance of Shia LaBeouf, supporting cast all good. The acts of war, the way it has been photographed, it felt so realistic and gruesome that we sometimes thought we were watching a documentary. As we were already informed there will be some things edited out, we think that this would make sense, the scene in the house with the two women, the scene in the tank, near the confrontation with the SS division, it all felt very long. It is tempting to compare FURY with movies like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or PEARL HARBOUR, but these two, in our opinion were more epic and large scale and had a more interesting story. With hardly any female involvement and/or love interest (the scene in the house is not enough) and with all the terrible violence in the movie, we feel that it will be limited to younger and older men only, combined with an age rating of 16 the movie will have its limit with regards to box-office potential. If we look at comps there is a huge difference between the low and the high performers. Taking pedigree of the makers and the talent into account we will enter the following numbers into Interplan: GBO 1 millionRENTAL 400kAdpub 250kNo. of prints 70.New ZealandWe are very happy to report that the film met our high expectations. It was gritty, full of tension and the time flew by. It was tough in parts and will probably get an R16 certificate here. The finale was good and the tone was in keeping with the rest of the film i.e. the cavalry didn’t arrive at the last minute to save all the team. It had a number of softer more human moments in between all the tension. Very good performances all round from the cast. We have a HQ target of $1.1M which we feel is very achievable. $2M might be a struggle given the R16 but we are happy to go with an estimate of $1.6M. That was our number for Black Hawk Down. Advertising would be $225K-$250K and prints would be in the 45 to 50 range.NorwayNorway has screened Fury, and we are excited about the movie. The movie is strong, and with marketing material focusing on the Brad Pit character, this will be a success. GBO LC 20 m/ US$ 3,244 mRevenue LC 7.407m/ US$ 1,201mAdPub LC 1.5m/ US$ 1,5mPrints LC 658k/ US$ 107k Censorship 15 Years/PG 12 Years NoteWe have a special situation with the largest exhibitor chain in Norway and for the time being, they do not play our movies. If this is the matter when we release Fury, we will have to reduce the estimated GBO by 30%.RussiaWe screened the movie and enjoyed the very charismatic characters and strong realistic feel of the epoch. I’m quite sure the film will have positive reactions from critics and industry press.There are some challenges which don’t let me be so optimistic about movie’s commercial potential here as I was a year ago when we initially discussed it. I was happy to realize that the number of very violent/tough scenes looked somewhat softer than I could imagine them from reading the script.We still couldn’t feel much empathy to the character of Wardaddy. I believe it might cause a serious issue for general audience to receive the film well. I guess technically the main character is Norman but due to charisma of Brad Pitt (and his superstar status) much more attention is focused on him who’s personage in the story is too controversial.War drama is pretty challenging genre for Russia. In case of WW2 there are two factors those make it particularly complicated for our market in current political situation. - Huge anti-American buzz in Russian press and social media due to sanctions and situation in Ukraine - Specific view of classical Soviet/Russian history on the role of US in WW2. It was criticizing F.D.Roosevelt for waiting so long before starting ground operation against Nazis in Europe. Due of general downturn in political relationship this factor is getting stronger in very negative way.I believe we can minimize negative effect of factors above by focusing our campaign on several major selling points Obviously Brad is the most powerful asset for selling the film to broad audience Several battle scenes look very impressive (we will need pure action trailer as well )The key characters look brutal but attractiveI would suggest To position the movie more like a war action starring Brad rather than a war drama To avoid/conceal most tragic realities of the war (dead bodies in the mud, kids in Nazi’s uniform)To focus on battles, violent scenes where we see war daddy as a “badass guy” rather than a tragic character To include scenes when the guys talk about having sex with German girls including the one when Wardaddy insists Norman to have sex with young girl in the apartment. It will help us to present the characters in most realistic way not like “angels worriers” To emphasize Russian producer and director of photography The earliest test screening will be very helpful to understand if we are wrong in this approach I think we can make 200m (85m in revenue) from 650 screens with ad/pub of 35m.We need to be aggressive enough in our marketing to make people talk about the film to have strong opening. I believe the movie will be a strong debates generator. Even with mixed WOM we can expect strong hold on second weekend and further due to controversial theme. South KoreaAlthough this is not for the females film and war genre, this is anticipated and decent film to the male audience with high quality in almost every elements including Bred Pitt’s attraction. If we have a Bred Pitt’s junket and remove a few cruel scenes or cuts in order to get 15+ such as -Wardaddy stabs the eye of German soldier who rode white horse with knife.-Torn part of the face splattered when Norman cleans the bloodstain in FURY tank -Head of the American tank operator is blown away by attack of German soldiers my estimates are; Gross box office 15 billion KW/14.6 million USDRental estimate 6.9 billion KW/6.7 million USDReleasing cost/450 screens 540 million KW/.5 million USDAdpub including junket 2.2 billion KW/2.1 million USDNet contribution 4.16 billion KW/4 million USD I presume the most similar recent comparable title is 300 which hit 18.7 billion KW/18 million USD as their gbo.Also we want to release this film in November depending on BP’s visiting schedule.Besides shorter running time is very appreciated.SpainWe have just seen the movie and we like it a lot. It has really good mix of action, emotion, romance and smart dialogues. The tanks battles are just fantastic and make you feel you are inside the tank fighting along with Wardaddy and his team! Intense and claustrophobic movie at times in a good way. Happy with our date in Jan because we have no doubt this movie really is an epic and Oscar contender and we really have to make the most of it! The only handicap is that the movie gets too violent at times with explicit scenes that will reduce our mainstream target mainly hitting on the female segment who is interested in Brad Pitt. Also, the running time is just too long and ideally we´d like to cut down a bit. The sequence in the apartment with the 2 German ladies is far too long. Our projection is: BO estimate 6MAd/Pub: 1.4MPrints: 450Date: Jan 16th. Same pattern as Django ( 11M) and Wolf of Wall Street (12m) Comps:Inglorious Bastards: 11M ( here the violence was an benefit given the natural target of Tarantino)Saving Private Ryan: 10MLincoln: 5MBlack Hawk Down: 2.4MSwedenWe screened Fury yesterday and it is very well crafted, thrilling gritty war drama. We considered the dialogue, acting and the whole film really strong and commercial. We expect that reviews will be great, probably mostly 4 out of 5. We are still hoping for a visit from director David Ayer + one talent in Stockholm for a Scandinavian junket, as we are still very much PR driven territory and this would certainly gain very good coverage in press and media. When looking on all comps, we are having much higher estimate on this one, compared to other war movies:(All in SEK)Valkyria ; 14.1 MEnemy at the gates; 7,6 MWindtalkers: 2,5 MFlags of our Fathers; 1,2 MMonuments Men; 8,1 MLone Survivor; 1,5 M On top of these, we have the Quentin Tarantino movies. QT is a huge star in this country, almost to be compared as an A-list rock star. He visits Sweden frequently and is communicating this country as a big influence for his new script(s). QT movies plays in own league here: Django; 36,8 MInglorious Bastards; 36 M We have putting an estimate of 23 M which is very high level, but also includes the great outcome value from David’s visit to Sweden. The challenge to reach these high levels is how to reach the girls and women, to be able to communicate this is a drama, not just a war film.SwitzerlandWe really were impressed by the high quality of the movie – a very solid production and a great job from a great director! Great cast (brilliant performances by Brad Pitt as well as Logan Lerman), a lot of action and thrilling moments. no ground breaking story of course and there were moments of thinking “seen that before”, but with this pedigree it is definitely something outstanding and we should be happy to have it in our line-up! all our numbers are in interplan as followingBO: 2,9 mio LCREV: 1,2 mio LCAD/PUB: 500k LCPRINTS: 120CR: 16 yrs (no issues expected) Quite ambitious goals (right in the middle of what inglorious basterds and Valkyrie did), but we strongly believe in this title and we will be able to set up a great campaign with this ad/pub budget. We have to do our homework in order to bring it out of the “war movie genre” and make it a “High-profile must-see action spectacle”. The difference between the release dates in French and German part is in our favor, because we would have enough time to react if it doesn’t perform as expected.UKDrama of the highest quality with a truly authentic and captivating backdrop. The strength lies particularly in the performances all of which convince and engage. Understandably difficult to watch at times it does not veer away for the complexities and horror of its subject, that may be difficult for some audiences to take. It is hugely marketable with a true A list star giving marquee value and every opportunity to launch successfully. Reviews should be in the 4 star range.Perhaps a little long with trimming only improving the whole experience. The spend below assumes the agreement to closing night of LFF and therefore premiere costs at a minimum. Should we need to fund and event ourselves another £200k would be required.BO £10mRental £3.7mScreen 500Other £150kSpend £2.6mRating 15Mark Braddel MarketsI think the film-makers really delivered on the script that we read and we have a quality movie in our hands. The main problem I have is that as good as the film is it really doesn’t add much to the genre. The characters and situations are very familiar and the director’s attempts to inject a little Tarantino edginess to the proceedings don’t really work in my opinion. We’ve become accustomed to this style of filming war dramas from Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers right through to War Horse and Lone Survivor more recently. For most of my territories I do agree that we need to focus more on the action and less on the drama. I also think we need to identify more clearly that their ultimate mission is to hold off a whole battalion on their own. That should help along with positioning Brad Pitt at the centre of the story and contrasting his perspective on the war with that of Norman’s. I also think we need to see more of that final battle in the trailer. Older males definitely the target and should be easy to get in Scandinavia, Greece and Portugal. Younger males less easy and will need the action material to get them. I can’t really see the film being that attractive to women despite the presence of Brad Pitt. I think nominations are a given but awards are probably a bridge too far. I have seen your response to Anton’s comments and even though they have not seen the film Ukraine is very much of the same opinion. Given their political situation they definitely need materials that position this as a classic Hollywood war movie. They are already having problems with exhibitors being reluctant to play anything serious in certain parts of the country so this might ultimately affect their ability to hit a target. Were the GBO targets revised after we acquired Russia and Ukraine as there are none in Interplan ? Looking at the Scandinavia screened numbers both Sweden and Norway are pretty aggressive and you have seen their comments. I spoke with Denmark today and he thinks he should just about be able to get to his target. Norway is on target, Sweden and Denmark 20% less. Finland – Pre Plan coming in at 40% of Target – Target 80% of Django so very toughGreece – Pre-Plan coming in at 85% of Target - Target is the same as Django – we did this gross on Captain Phillips but the hostage/shipping company aspects of that story were familiar to everyone – can get close but I think they are very optimistic and will focus more on the drama hereIceland – Pre-Plan coming in at 40% of Traget - Target is 70% of Django – Iceland not big on drama or period films – need to focus on action and star sell herePortugal – Pre=Plan coming in at 60% of Target - Target is 22% more than Django and only Smurfs and ASM have exceeded 1m GBO there for us – probably similar to Greece in that they would like to stress the drama Based on the screened numbers submitted by Denmark, Norway and Sweden plus the Pre-Plans for the balance, my group (ex Russia) comes in somewhere around $10.5m compared to the Home Office Target of $12.3m which does not include Ukraine. I honestly think that $10.5m is likely to be closer to $9m at the end of the day.",Private

"Dear all, Please find below updated reviews for Fury which average out at about 3 stars. The document attached has the partial and full reviews to date. The Sunday Telegraph, Sunday Herald Sun, Sunday Mail – MIXED / POSITIVE3.5 / 5 starsThere’s a nail- ­biting duel between the tank and a bigger, deadlier German one. A break from the mayhem comes in a tense, lengthy scene involving two German women that gives Pitt a chance to stretch out and exercise his acting chops. The film’s climactic showdown borrows a little too heavily from Private Ryan and threatens to take the film into gung-ho Rambo territory.But ultimately we’re left in no doubt of Ayer’s anti-war intentions. It’s not the heroism of his characters that stays with you but the mud, blood and tears. Sun Herald/Sunday Age, Craig Mathieson - MIXED / POSITIVE3 / 5 stars… excruciatingly bloody. Mass graves, executions, heads turned to a fine pink mist and shredded bodies are all quickly prominent in David Ayer's movie. Light relief? Try corpses glowing around the shrapnel wounds of phosphorus rounds. Ayer has been writing and then directing about men in various forms of combat for almost 15 years. He understands the destructive faith of camaraderie, and the ritual of confinement. Like Pena and Jake Gyllenhaal in a police car in 2012's End of Watch, the lumbering tank's grizzled crew enact their favourite conversations as a way of keeping it together. The actors, especially LaBeouf, are solid. It becomes a simpler film the further it goes on… It may be the most capably directed of Ayer's five feature films, and has a shuddering physicality, but it's also the most predictable. 3AW, Jim Schembri - MIXED / POSITIVE3.5 / 5 starsFor the most part, Fury is a grittily realistic, punishing, often compelling film about the realities of war and what it can do to the souls of ordinary men. Thankfully, Pitt, one of the film's producers, is now clearly more interested in pushing himself as an actor than ever. The only real letdown in Fury is the finale. Having worked so hard to establish the harsh reality of close quarters combat, Ayer then stages an improbable, way over-long battle sequence that stars some of the politest German grenades in war movie history. With that one major quibble aside, Fury is a richly detailed, exciting, sometimes harrowing war film. In support as the tank crew are Michael Pena, Logan Lerman and Jon Bernthal, who deserves an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of the tank's most stressed-out member.Of special note is the excellent performance by Shia LaBeouf, who proves here just how good he can be when he just shuts up and acts. The Today Show, Richard Wilkins - POSITIVE4 / 5 starsBrad Pitt is absolutely sensational.Logan Lerman is terrific as Norman… … the cinematography is quite superb, the production and direction incredible, the scale of the whole film impressive and compelling. It’s a movie not a documentary and it’s called FURY. It’s not a date movie. Weekend Sunrise, Jason “Jabba” Davis - MIXED / POSITIVE3 / 5 stars..So when a film like Fury comes along, it can be difficult to determine what it could be trying to say that hasn’t been said before. Turns out, not much.Extremely serious, deeply disturbed and with accents that can be difficult to understandThe storyline is sparse, if existent at allLacking any of the usual banter and camaraderie we’ve come to expect from virtually all previous war productions….Fury is a bleak picture of the realities of how low men can go when pitted against each other in a life or death struggle. The one aspect I kept coming back to was the involvement of Brad Pitt. Given his penchant recently for more political films – World War Z and 12 Years a Slave, it makes me think there is more to this film than meets the eye. RN (Radio National), Jason Di Rosso - MIXED..a brutal and gruesome film. …colloquial, masculine and bordering on comic—but it is also a grotesque parody of family. The relentless momentum of the army's advance is something Ayer communicates through beautiful, dynamic images, including a glowing tracer fire cutting through the sky. Cameras mounted on tanks also transform the lumbering machines into graceful carriages, until you notice they’ve driven over a corpse or crushed a man alive. …Ayer underestimates the audience with this saccharine moment of doomed puppy love. He’s ramming home a point that the film has already made clear—innocence gets crushed in war. You feel like fist-pumping, therefore, when Fury returns to its more brutal, perverse register and goes back to focusing on men inside a tin can being shaken by the hand of some merciless God. OK Magazine - MIXEDBrad Pitt plays Norman’s sergeant, Don ‘Wardaddy’ Collier, who becomes a twisted sort of father-figure to the young recruit. The relationship between the two drives the movie towards a stunning climax and is the reason to watch Fury, even if you’re not a fan of war films. The LennoX Files, Dwayne Lennox - MIXED.. Fury excels in its action sequences…but splutters somewhat when it stops to focus on the men inside the war machine....at-times indecipherable dialogue. While the highly effective sound design has you rattled by shell fire and jumping at exploding land mines, it's often a struggle to understand Grady's thick Southern accent or Boyd's recitation of Bible verses when the men are at rest. ..intermittently tension-filled, Fury succeeds when in the midst of battle but fails to win hearts and minds when a ceasefire is called to focus on the less than convincing human drama. ABC Radio, Brisbane, Matthew Toomey - POSITIVEGrade: B+A few parts feel over-dramatised, over-scripted but it's still a strong drama with Logan Lerman stealing the show in the later stages. Moustache Magazine, Jo McTavishDavid Ayer presents a film that captures the horror of war but reflects the unity in humanity and the things we do to survive. Fury is not going to be for everyone, but if you do appreciate a film that represents the history of war without glorifying it, then make sure you ride along with the lads this week. Super Quick Reviews, Casey - POSITIVE4/5 starsGraphic, confronting, revolting, and touching all at the same time, Fury shows the worst and the best of the people thrust unwillingly into war. I left the cinema thinking about what war has the capacity to do to people… Reel Gospel, Mark Woodhouse - NEGATIVE2.5/5 starsFury is very well filmed and put together...on the one hand, the film very successfully and skillfully elicited a deep emotional response from me as a viewer. But on the other hand, I didn’t enjoy that emotional response – it was a deeply unsettling and distinctly unenjoyable experience.Women are treated awfully, as prizes of war and not as people..Where the film fails is its portrayal of the American soldiers as heroes. This is a patriotic American WW2 film…Boyd ‘Bible’ Swan (LeBeouf), preaches unashamedly to his tank-mates. It’s an interesting version of Christianity..I can’t recommend seeing this film, as well made as it is.. if you do see it, there are heaps of great conversations about the love of God that can flow from it. Daily Review, Crikey, Luke Buckmaster - NEGATIVE1.5 / 5 starsIt begins as a stylised, even gamified look at the soullessness of war and eventually disintegrates, as so many of them do, into gung-ho parochialism and excitable rants about winning at all costs. The film paints itself into a moral mess. Ayers wants it both ways, arguing war makes monsters out of men but that his subject is in essence better than the others for reasons he cannot explain — and which, amid the thunder, roar and stink of the battle field, no longer seem relevant. Ayers impresses on a technical level. But despite the chest-beating, and despite all the cries about what is bad and good and just and what is not, it’s pretty soulless stuff. Gold 104.3FM, Pete the Movie Guy –MIXED Score: 6.75 out of 10.. for the most part Fury is a solid-but-let-down-by-a-few-key-moments WW2 flick.. ..there’s not so much of a story, as rather a series of episodic violent encounters.. We swing from total moments of seemingly-zero logic to some of the tensest battle scenes ever to appear on the big screen.. ultimately sees Fury as good, without being a stand out. Performances are all solid.. Reel Good, John Roebuck –MIXED6/10 starsThe strength of Fury is its acknowledgement that this camaraderie may not always be born out of brotherhood, but out of the need for solidarity. Ayer’s strength is atmosphere and the film does an admirable job at evoking what the final months of the Second World War might have felt like. Unfortunately, the weaknesses of Fury don’t do its strengths justice, and the film slowly degenerates into a far more mindless film than the opening act would have you expect. With every turn, Ayer looses sight of his assets, until ultimately Fury resembles any of the endless number of the minor action films that have predated it.. for the most part, it does offer a compelling insight into a more bleak perspective of wartime intimacy. If Ayer had curbed his inclination for action, it might have been a much finer film.",Private

"Dear All, Please find below - and attached - the reactions received to date to the FURY temp DCPs. The version screened was the same version that screened in Huntington Beach a couple of weeks ago. Please feel free to share with your teams who are working on this title. Regards,Nigel FURY DCP Screening ReactionsMARKETREACTIONSArgentinaWe all really enjoyed the movie here in Argentina, we think the actors' performances were great and it has a solid plot. We expect a 16 censorship. Considering the target of the movie, we believe this censorship shouldn't be a problem.Our estimate numbers are: GBO LC 7M (US$ 850K)Revenue LC 2,748,112 (US$ 335K)ADPub LC 1.2M (US$ 146K)Print Cost: LC554K (US$ 67K) 65 ScreensAustraliaA powerful war drama….that resonated best with males in the team and to an okay-modest reaction from the female members. It was tough & raw at times, necessarily so with war films …and consequently will attract a restricted ‘MA’-15 years rating level. (It is at the top end of our MA classification…but assume some of the blood splatter effects may be toned down in the final version…and for the USA to get an R-version). All envisaged a tighter version to come…and a shorter running time.Acting & characters were top shelf….Brad & Shia were outstanding as were all of the ‘tank crew’. There was perhaps less action than expected but the critical tank engagement scenes were riveting.There was less of a storyline arc & hence emotional involvement than say, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN….but it’s commercial strength lies with Brad Pitt leading, fans of war movies and strong cast performances. Commercial up-side will depend on Award noms and very strong critic reaction.EstimatesRelease date: November 27, 2014.GBO LC$8 million / USD7.5 millionRentals LC$3.2 millionAd/Pub LC$2 millionPrints 200+ Comparable Films Title Release Date Rating G.B.O. FLAGS OF OUR FATHER 2 Nov ’06 MA 1,848,000 GREEN ZONE 11 Mar ’10 M 6,630,000 SAVING PRIVATE RYAN 19 Nov ’98 MA 24,172,000 LONE SURVIVOR 20 Feb ’14 MA 4,018,000 BLACK HAWK DOWN 21 Feb ‘02 MA 10,609,000 THE HURT LOCKER 18 Feb ’10 MA 5,828,000 Austria Belgium Brazil Denmark FranceVery well made movie. The war scenes which represent 90% of the movie are very powerful and captivating. Filming into the tank really gives the measure and the intensity of what the crew is experiencing. The last battle is great but maybe too long and a little unrealistic, but I’m sure it will be a fantastic scene if it is shortened a little bit.Our biggest concern is about the scene with the German ladies. It is a very important scene as it is the only one which doesn’t happen on the battlefield, and we didn’t find it very realistic and very well made. The girl singing while the soldier is playing piano, and everybody’s behavior when the rest of the crew arrives in the apartment, seemed odd to everyone attending the screening.Otherwise, actors are very good and the relationship between the soldiers is excellent, and , again the war scenes are very well made.GBO estimate: 5.6M€GermanyNo doubt, FURY is a film with 5 excellent actors who perform absolutely compelling, headed by a brilliant Brad Pitt in an unusual role. However, we are facing some challenges with this film. The target group is hard to define – we won´t get the young males (they see films like TF4 or Guardians of the Galaxy), very likely no females as it is very / too violent (which might get us the 16) – and for the older audience it doesn´t really have a new approach to the darkest part of our history as e.g. INGL. BASTERDS had which made this film so special, even for Germans. Apart from this, it is definitely too long. This is the reason we drastically had to reduce our original Estimates which was given us from Home Office last year in London – and we would also suggest to reduce our Ad/Pub. GERMANY: B.O.: 2.625.000 Euro Rev.: 1.050.000 Euro Prints: 250Ad/pub: 1.200.000 Euro (instead of 2.2 !!)Mexico NetherlandsWe screened FURY today. It is an impressive, raw and ultra-violent war movie. Brad Pitt is strong, we were pleasantly surprised by the performance of Shia LaBeouf, supporting cast all good. The acts of war, the way it has been photographed, it felt so realistic and gruesome that we sometimes thought we were watching a documentary. As we were already informed there will be some things edited out, we think that this would make sense, the scene in the house with the two women, the scene in the tank, near the confrontation with the SS division, it all felt very long. It is tempting to compare FURY with movies like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or PEARL HARBOUR, but these two, in our opinion were more epic and large scale and had a more interesting story. With hardly any female involvement and/or love interest (the scene in the house is not enough) and with all the terrible violence in the movie, we feel that it will be limited to younger and older men only, combined with an age rating of 16 the movie will have its limit with regards to box-office potential. If we look at comps there is a huge difference between the low and the high performers. Taking pedigree of the makers and the talent into account we will enter the following numbers into Interplan: GBO 1 millionRENTAL 400kAdpub 250kNo. of prints 70.New ZealandWe are very happy to report that the film met our high expectations. It was gritty, full of tension and the time flew by. It was tough in parts and will probably get an R16 certificate here. The finale was good and the tone was in keeping with the rest of the film i.e. the cavalry didn’t arrive at the last minute to save all the team. It had a number of softer more human moments in between all the tension. Very good performances all round from the cast. We have a HQ target of $1.1M which we feel is very achievable. $2M might be a struggle given the R16 but we are happy to go with an estimate of $1.6M. That was our number for Black Hawk Down. Advertising would be $225K-$250K and prints would be in the 45 to 50 range.NorwayNorway has screened Fury, and we are excited about the movie. The movie is strong, and with marketing material focusing on the Brad Pit character, this will be a success. GBO LC 20 m/ US$ 3,244 mRevenue LC 7.407m/ US$ 1,201mAdPub LC 1.5m/ US$ 1,5mPrints LC 658k/ US$ 107k Censorship 15 Years/PG 12 Years NoteWe have a special situation with the largest exhibitor chain in Norway and for the time being, they do not play our movies. If this is the matter when we release Fury, we will have to reduce the estimated GBO by 30%.RussiaWe screened the movie and enjoyed the very charismatic characters and strong realistic feel of the epoch. I’m quite sure the film will have positive reactions from critics and industry press.There are some challenges which don’t let me be so optimistic about movie’s commercial potential here as I was a year ago when we initially discussed it. I was happy to realize that the number of very violent/tough scenes looked somewhat softer than I could imagine them from reading the script.We still couldn’t feel much empathy to the character of Wardaddy. I believe it might cause a serious issue for general audience to receive the film well. I guess technically the main character is Norman but due to charisma of Brad Pitt (and his superstar status) much more attention is focused on him who’s personage in the story is too controversial.War drama is pretty challenging genre for Russia. In case of WW2 there are two factors those make it particularly complicated for our market in current political situation. - Huge anti-American buzz in Russian press and social media due to sanctions and situation in Ukraine - Specific view of classical Soviet/Russian history on the role of US in WW2. It was criticizing F.D.Roosevelt for waiting so long before starting ground operation against Nazis in Europe. Due of general downturn in political relationship this factor is getting stronger in very negative way.I believe we can minimize negative effect of factors above by focusing our campaign on several major selling points Obviously Brad is the most powerful asset for selling the film to broad audience Several battle scenes look very impressive (we will need pure action trailer as well )The key characters look brutal but attractiveI would suggest To position the movie more like a war action starring Brad rather than a war drama To avoid/conceal most tragic realities of the war (dead bodies in the mud, kids in Nazi’s uniform)To focus on battles, violent scenes where we see war daddy as a “badass guy” rather than a tragic character To include scenes when the guys talk about having sex with German girls including the one when Wardaddy insists Norman to have sex with young girl in the apartment. It will help us to present the characters in most realistic way not like “angels worriers” To emphasize Russian producer and director of photography The earliest test screening will be very helpful to understand if we are wrong in this approach I think we can make 200m (85m in revenue) from 650 screens with ad/pub of 35m.We need to be aggressive enough in our marketing to make people talk about the film to have strong opening. I believe the movie will be a strong debates generator. Even with mixed WOM we can expect strong hold on second weekend and further due to controversial theme. South KoreaAlthough this is not for the females film and war genre, this is anticipated and decent film to the male audience with high quality in almost every elements including Bred Pitt’s attraction. If we have a Bred Pitt’s junket and remove a few cruel scenes or cuts in order to get 15+ such as -Wardaddy stabs the eye of German soldier who rode white horse with knife.-Torn part of the face splattered when Norman cleans the bloodstain in FURY tank -Head of the American tank operator is blown away by attack of German soldiers my estimates are; Gross box office 15 billion KW/14.6 million USDRental estimate 6.9 billion KW/6.7 million USDReleasing cost/450 screens 540 million KW/.5 million USDAdpub including junket 2.2 billion KW/2.1 million USDNet contribution 4.16 billion KW/4 million USD I presume the most similar recent comparable title is 300 which hit 18.7 billion KW/18 million USD as their gbo.Also we want to release this film in November depending on BP’s visiting schedule.Besides shorter running time is very appreciated.SpainWe have just seen the movie and we like it a lot. It has really good mix of action, emotion, romance and smart dialogues. The tanks battles are just fantastic and make you feel you are inside the tank fighting along with Wardaddy and his team! Intense and claustrophobic movie at times in a good way. Happy with our date in Jan because we have no doubt this movie really is an epic and Oscar contender and we really have to make the most of it! The only handicap is that the movie gets too violent at times with explicit scenes that will reduce our mainstream target mainly hitting on the female segment who is interested in Brad Pitt. Also, the running time is just too long and ideally we´d like to cut down a bit. The sequence in the apartment with the 2 German ladies is far too long. Our projection is: BO estimate 6MAd/Pub: 1.4MPrints: 450Date: Jan 16th. Same pattern as Django ( 11M) and Wolf of Wall Street (12m) Comps:Inglorious Bastards: 11M ( here the violence was an benefit given the natural target of Tarantino)Saving Private Ryan: 10MLincoln: 5MBlack Hawk Down: 2.4MSwedenWe screened Fury yesterday and it is very well crafted, thrilling gritty war drama. We considered the dialogue, acting and the whole film really strong and commercial. We expect that reviews will be great, probably mostly 4 out of 5. We are still hoping for a visit from director David Ayer + one talent in Stockholm for a Scandinavian junket, as we are still very much PR driven territory and this would certainly gain very good coverage in press and media. When looking on all comps, we are having much higher estimate on this one, compared to other war movies:(All in SEK)Valkyria ; 14.1 MEnemy at the gates; 7,6 MWindtalkers: 2,5 MFlags of our Fathers; 1,2 MMonuments Men; 8,1 MLone Survivor; 1,5 M On top of these, we have the Quentin Tarantino movies. QT is a huge star in this country, almost to be compared as an A-list rock star. He visits Sweden frequently and is communicating this country as a big influence for his new script(s). QT movies plays in own league here: Django; 36,8 MInglorious Bastards; 36 M We have putting an estimate of 23 M which is very high level, but also includes the great outcome value from David’s visit to Sweden. The challenge to reach these high levels is how to reach the girls and women, to be able to communicate this is a drama, not just a war film.Switzerland UKDrama of the highest quality with a truly authentic and captivating backdrop. The strength lies particularly in the performances all of which convince and engage. Understandably difficult to watch at times it does not veer away for the complexities and horror of its subject, that may be difficult for some audiences to take. It is hugely marketable with a true A list star giving marquee value and every opportunity to launch successfully. Reviews should be in the 4 star range.Perhaps a little long with trimming only improving the whole experience. The spend below assumes the agreement to closing night of LFF and therefore premiere costs at a minimum.

"Please find below an overview of the weekend UK national newspaper reviews for FURY – pdfs of the full reviews are attached. THE INDEPENDENT ON SATURDAY – 4/5 STARS – POSITIVE...Fury is bayonet-to-the-face, grenade-in-the-stomach violent......Fury wants to rub your face in mud and guts. It isn’t entertaining, exactly, but it is intensely, joltingly visceral. It hasn’t got much plot, but exists instead in an endless nightmarish present.....this isn’t normal Hollywood filmmaking. It is brutally ugly, and if we are going to tell ourselves war stories, then this is just what they should look like. GUARDIAN GUIDE – NO STAR RATINGS GIVEN – MIXEDSomewhere near the crossroads of Saving Private Ryan and Inglourious Basterds, this second world war movies lumbers over some tricky terrain, complicating the clear-cu heroism of Pit and his tank crew, conveying the combat action in thrilling and authentic detail, but failing to avoid all the clichés that litter this landscape like landmines. THE SUNDAY TIMES – 3/5 STARS – MIXED...Pitt clearly signed up to Fury in order to pee on Germany, and royally pee on Germany he does, mindlessly hogging the screen for 134 minutes, smouldering in mirrors and crashing through fields and hedgerows...And why tanks you ask? ...Because, obviously, the outfits look great. Oh God, this is a clumping, silly, unsophisticated film, and oh God, I quite loved it. The cast reads like some kind of drunk wish list for Life of Pi......This is a movie not about fury or even passion, but the opposite – it is about the drudgery and dull horror of war, the piles of bodies and mindless loss of lives, the quotidian angst and anger and panic about survival, the sense that there is only one thing to hang on to, and that thing is their terrible work....Does Fury say anything about war that hasn’t been covered before? There’s a feeling that its writer-director, David Ayer, had almost given up before he started...the only lesson is that there is no lesson. THE OBSERVER – NO STAR RATING GIVEN – MIXEDThe spirit of Sam Peckinpah hangs over this surprisingly grim, macho tank drama, which marries the tough-men-in-peril thrills of an old-fashioned war movie with the post-Saving Private Ryan viscera of a modern ‘war is hell’ parable. With its trench-mud palette and limb-mangling splatter aesthetic, Fury takes no prisoners in terms of graphic detail... character remains an adjunct to the action, which is Ayer’s true forte....this is still undeniably stirring stuff, buoyed by Steven Price’s boisterous score... MAIL ON SUNDAY – 2/5 STARS – MIXED / NEGATIVE...this is a brutal, uncompromisingly violent film that is definitely going to divide audiences and, as the camera pulled out at the end to reveal an ever-growing number of Nazi corpses, my over-riding sense was of disappointment. Somewhere along the muddy, bloody, body-splattered way, Brad and I had parted company......Fury comes across as a strangely old-fashioned picture.... Fury eventually becomes war pornography, each death needing to be a little more explicit, a little nastier than the one before. And, also, Fury ignores the fact that the kind of war it depicts doesn’t exist any more...so I struggle to see why this particular story is being told now.Fury isn’t terrible, although it does suffer occasionally from mumbled dialogue and glib lines...The explosive pyrotechnics are impressive, as is the production design...this mix of gore, heroism and noble sacrifice will do well. But it wasn’t for me and I’m confident I won’t be alone. SUNDAY EXPRESS – 3/5 STARS – MIXEDFury is a Second World War movie full of earth-shattering sound and, yes, plenty of fury...signifying, what exactly? Shot in grey, muted colours, this is a Second World War movie without a sense of righteousness. War is much too mucky for that, even a conflict with such a clear-cut cause. ..That is the picture’s Big Idea: take the most noble of conflicts and portray the grim, dehumanising reality of it. All in explicit, often disturbing detail... The impression of senseless slaughter is heightened by the fact that the war is almost over... It is a valid approach that plunges us into the bloody conclusion of a just war and shows us the reality: not just the sickening violence but the blurred dividing line between right and wrong, heroism and craziness. There are some exciting, tense battle sequences... the problem is that Ayer wants to have his cake and eat it: the realism and the Hollywood war movie thrills so the story is increasingly hard to credit, culminating in an extended climax that feels false from start to finish......Nevertheless, Fury is a muscular, well-made war film. It pulls no punches and boasts strong work from the cast, led by a commanding Pitt. THE PEOPLE – 5/5 STARS – POSITIVE...this mud and guts war epic that takes no prisoners.Riveted together with excellent acting and direction, the phenomenal fight sequences leave you battered and bruised. Macho down to its army boots, this is an awesome war movie that magnificently depicts war as hell.",Private

I don't think we have the same risk here, so I'm sure we can put a few days between the two moves, but all's I'm saying is that by doing it in one official announcement we look smart and strategic.

Even if Brad has to be in the US during the week leading up to 10/17, as far as I can see there are no impediments to him being in London for that Sunday evening for the closing night of the festival. We appreciate that he may have to depart immediately after the red carpet in order to be back in Malta to commence filming on Monday morning. To reiterate, other than the US, no territory should release prior to 10/19*, and under no circumstances can the film play in another festival prior to 10/19.

He really wants us to commit to the LFF. As he sees it, regardless of whether we move the US date or not, LFF is a prestigious platform for the international launch, and will secure as much publicity as we could hope for in a one-stop environment. I agree with him. The bottom line is that regardless of the on-going negotiation over Brad’s travel to the US, the LFF closing night is happening on 10/19, and we have that weekend (the 18th and 19th) cleared in his diary. As Brad was not due to be working those two days, I’m assuming there’s no cost involved in closing the set. If we ultimately lose the Monday and forego the Paris premiere, so be it.

Have you been able to speak with production to see of they can build in a hiatus or otherwise minimize the cost if we need Brad the full week of October 13-20. I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity. In that scenario maybe we would try to tack on a few hours of work at the end of August when he's at Bovington for long lead euro press. How",Private

I agree with him. The bottom line is that regardless of the on-going negotiation over Brad’s travel to the US, the LFF closing night is happening on 10/19, and we have that weekend (the 18th and 19th) cleared in his diary. As Brad was not due to be working those two days, I’m assuming there’s no cost involved in closing the set. If we ultimately lose the Monday and forego the Paris premiere, so be it.

Have you been able to speak with production to see of they can build in a hiatus or otherwise minimize the cost if we need Brad the full week of October 13-20. I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity. In that scenario maybe we would try to tack on a few hours of work at the end of August when he's at Bovington for long lead euro p",Private

You are correct regarding the opening/closing for 2013. Captain Phillips went on to gross a terrific £16.2m, our biggest film of the year. Saving Mr Banks delivered £4.4m, a disappointing gross as much a result of the release date as the campaign. Fury is certainly closer to the first movie here, not just in style but in its fit for the UK market. The reviews for our movie were very good indeed and those for Disney were good without being exceptional overall. For Fury we think we are in 4 star territory and the prestige of the closing night will surely position the film in exactly the way we would hope.

We would of course be happy to go back with a yes please however we do need to confirm talent access and whether we intend to pursue other festivals. Last year on Captain Phillips we found ourselves in a very compromising position where goal posts kept moving and our relationship with the LFF became untenable. We do need to go back to them with a clear remit of our intention, whatever it may be, however a world premiere of a movie shot in the UK with such a universal message must surely be a convincing argument. For the Festival we are pretty much close to the wire on deadline and would love to confirm asap. It is a marvellous opportunity to be embraced in every way. Regards Peter",Private

"RE: Fury - Spain Hola Steven, got it! I just wanted to get as much information as possible before sending a formal proposal to move the date back to Jan 1st for the following reasons: - January has much less competition than Nov or Dec, and Jan has always been really good month for adults films: Wolf of wall Street (12M euros), Django ( 10.8M), Sherlock Holmes (10.1M), Hereafter (9.5M), etc.. - Jan is a really good date if we expect any Oscar nominations to really boost the BO when the movie still plays strong enough. Silver Limning Jan 25th and 9.3M Euros, Descendants, Jan 20th and 8.5M… - We have no any major release since Dec 25th – Annie- until Chappie - March 27th Just a quick brief regarding big contenders during Oct , Nov and Dec: Oct 3rd : very likely to set Torrente 5 Oct 17th: likely to set Equalizer so that we can hardlock the trailer with Torrente and also take advantage of La Fiesta del cine ( 2 M admissions expected in 3 days) during Oct 20, 21 and 22 Nov 7th: Interstellar ( Inception grossed 16M euros) Nov 21st. Hunger Games: ( the previous chapter grossed more than 11M euros) Nov 28th : Home. And Mortadelo y Filemon ( very popular local characters. Animated for teens, Young adults and families). Director is Javier Fesser and his first chapter grossed 22M euros. This one should gross more at least 10M euros Dic 5th Exodus ( Prometheus grossed 10M euros) Dic 17th : Hobbit: previous movie grossed 17M euros Best De: ODell, Steven Enviado el: viernes, 09 de mayo de 2014 0:45 Para: Losada, Ivan CC: Alexander, Ralph Asunto: FW: Fury - Spain Hola Ivan, Ralph will be in touch early next week, but decision has been made to get out by early December latest.

You are correct regarding the opening/closing for 2013. Captain Phillips went on to gross a terrific £16.2m, our biggest film of the year. Saving Mr Banks delivered £4.4m, a disappointing gross as much a result of the release date as the campaign. Fury is certainly closer to the first movie here, not just in style but in its fit for the UK market. The reviews for our movie were very good indeed and those for Disney were good without being exceptional overall. For Fury we think we are in 4 star territory and the prestige of the closing night will surely position the film in exactly the way we would hope. As it falls within our opening week the issue of early reviews is not a concern.

Can this decision wait til then or must we make it sooner? To refresh my memory, Cap P opened the Fest last year and Saving Mr. Banks closed, correct? How did each film perform in the UK? While I know both were reviewed well, were they good or great?

This will be the first time we screen the film, press will see it there and imagine a few online reviews will appear that night and in print on Monday.

Just reminding everyone that this would be the world premiere. Is everyone comfortable with that? We do happen to have this weekend blocked on Brad’s calendar for international travel.

Suffice to say they loved its integrity, human involvement and its straight forward intent to appeal to a broad audience. We would of course be happy to go back with a yes please however we do need to confirm talent access and whether we intend to pursue other festivals. Last year on Captain Phillips we found ourselves in a very compromising position where goal posts kept moving and our relationship with the LFF became untenable. We do need to go back to them with a clear remit of our intention, whatever it may be, however a world premiere of a movie shot in the UK with such a universal message must surely be a convincing argument. For the Festival we are pretty much close to the wire on deadline and would love to confirm asap. It is a marvellous opportunity to be embraced in every way. Regards Peter",Private

"Please find below additional screening reactions from the UK. BAUER MEDIA / Jo Parkerson – POSITIVEWow! What a great film. All consuming, harrowing, thought provoking ... Such an excellent reminder of what actually went on in WW2. Logan Lerman stood out as a huge star in the making. They're all excellent - but he really stands out. HELLO! / Michelle Johnson – POSITIVEAbsolutely loved Fury. Highlight of the LFF offerings so far by a mile. Thought it was tense, complex and very gripping. Loved that it abstained from moral judgement on the rights and wrongs of the war itself. Loved the pacing and plot and the intelligence of the film as a whole. We'll definitely be reviewing for the issue out ahead of weekend release. We're currently debating between four and five stars. FREELANCE / Olly Richards – POSITIVEAbsolutely terrific. Couldn't tell you a single shot that didn't deserve to be there. Had me from beginning to end and told so much about those men and about war without resorting to spelling it out. What a superb director David Ayer has turned into. BBC RADIO 4 TODAY SHOW / Alan Cumiskey – POSITIVEThought it was great. A few Hollywood moments stopped it being five star but it was compelling brutal thoughtful and very well executed THE GUARDIAN / Caroline Hunter – MIXED / POSITIVEThis isn't the usual film that I would go to see as am not a huge fan of war re-enactments but I was curious about this one which is set towards the end, and not the middle, of the war. I found the war scenes relentless and disturbing at times, which I'm guessing was the point - this wasn't a film made for you to relax through. The acting was effective, the battle scenes - expertly realistic. I would have welcomed more of a plot and perhaps some respite from the relentless of the shelling and carnage, which at times felt a bit too much to watch. It's a powerful film and seeing Brad Pitt in a meaty, more mature role was interesting. It's a shame that there weren't more strong female characters in this film - the only two notable women actors felt incidental. THE LADY / Matt Warren – POSITIVELoved it, Zoe. Although I'm now deaf and in need of a cup of herb tea. Great characters, vivid action sequences. The only wobble in my view was the central scene with the two German women. Vital for pace of the film but didn't quite ring true. Definitely a winner though. BBC iPlayer / Sam Bailey – POSITIVEReally enjoyed it, but it was definitely challenging! I don’t think we’re really used to “gung ho” depictions of WW2 soldiers, more a reluctant virtuous soldier that would really rather be back home. It’s quite brave. FREELANCE / Karen Krizanovich – POSITIVEI hid under my jacket for at least 3 minutes during the last hurrah of Fury. I don’t even know about Gordo was killed, and I don’t want to know! This was an unexpectedly exciting and emotional film. Yes, a bit colour-by-numbers formulaic, but it’s a war movie and everyone likes tanks and Brad Pitt. Tracer bullets made it even more exciting, along with the overhead shots, just enough information to get us involved and quite a lot of shocking horror of war imagery. It is beautifully made, heartfelt and exciting. Mostly exciting! FREELANCE / Alan Jones – POSITIVEI liked FURY, even though it essentially boils down to just the 'War Is Hell' mantra. Action all good, but for me the best sequence was the one with the meal and the two German women - edgy, suspenseful, upsetting. Logan Lerman worked, Pitt can do this sort of role in his sleep, nice and gory too. Overall a winner. BBC / Alice Bruggen – POSITIVEI enjoyed the film. It’s definitely one that will be popular with the boys. I gasped out loud in the opening scene where Pitt stabs the soldier in the eye – but this set the tone for the rest of the film, which portrayed well the horrors of war. NME / Dan Brightmore – POSITIVE4* review. In David 'Training Day' Ayer's visceral WWII drama Brad Pitt is tank captain Wardaddy deployed behind enemy lines as the Allies push through Germany in April 1945. We experience ambushes and bone-snapping firefights through the eyes of rookie recruit Norman (Logan Lerman) who joins Wardaddy's crew. Shia LaBeouf puts in a memorable method acting shift as God-fearing gunner 'Bible' while Pitt's motley crew (also featuring Michael Pena and The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal) lurch from one suicide mission to the next. We've seen the rites of passage tale of an innocent young man turned killing machine before with Oliver Stone's Platoon. And the painstaking recreation of the hell of war is reminiscent of Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Wardaddy sagely states: ""Ideas are peaceful. History is violent"" as orchestral swells bookend scenes of mud, blood and pain that stray into war porn. Fury bluntly underlines the dehumanising terror of conflict. DAZED & CONFUSED / Owen Myers – POSITIVEI really liked the film. The real revelation was the excellent Logan Lerman, it felt like a career-making moment for him. I also found it very moving and a great subtle performance from Pitt.

THE SUN / Grant Rollings – POSITIVEI loved Fury. Better than Saving Private Ryan in my opinion. BBC RADIO 1 / Andy Taylor – POSITIVEI thought it was very good. Strong performances from Brad, Shia and Logan. Gruesomely real, very intense and gripping to watch. GLOBAL RADIO / Charlie Girling – POSITIVEI thought it was brilliant – absolutely gripping and Brad was amazing. BBC WORLD SERVICE RADIO – ARTS / Vincent Dowd – POSITIVE / MIXEDI didn’t know much about the film in advance, other than having seen the trailer. Though the movie’s a bit formulaic and holds few surprises, I nonetheless enjoyed it. The central cast are all strong and Logan Lerman (who I’ve never seen before) made his role believable… although his character arc is obvious from the moment he appears on screen. It’s very well made and gives, I would guess, a pretty accurate feel for how hellish being in a tank in the middle of battle must be like. The shoot-out in the last half-hour is pretty ridiculous if you think about it but has enough visceral power that you just go with it. It’ll be a hit, partly because of Brad Pitt’s presence but also because there have been few really strong WW2 movies for a while. EMPIRE ONLINE / Phil de Semlyen – POSITIVEIt was a properly bleak, post-Private Ryan war movie. Glad Ayer didn't go with the handheld approach because it might have been overwhelming: the violence and savagery of war has never been so terrifying. Some of the set pieces worked better than others - the tank duel was nerve-shredding - but it felt very committed to getting the subject right, and I really liked that about it. FREELANCE / TOTAL FILM / Jamie Graham – POSITIVEVery strong. Couple of niggles aside (felt the score was a tad overused & the climax veered towards Schwarzenegger territory, though with a human cost) it was exceptional. The terrible violence was treated in such a matter-of-fact manner that it really hit home, and the soiled palette of the film (dirt and desperation) gave a muddy reality to the war-is-hell inferno they trundle through. The performances were all top drawer. The dinner scene that forms the centrepiece of the movie was quite brilliant - reminded me of a couple of the best scenes in Inglorious Basterds but without QT's arch dialogue, meaning it was far more powerful & affecting. Likewise, the themes were adult & complex, with heroics shrouded in ambiguity. No simplistic flag-waving here. Sure it will be in the mix come awards season, and deservedly so. DAILY TELEGRAPH / Alice Vincent – POSITIVEAlthough I found it unrelentingly grim, it was a good, gripping, harrowing watch which has stuck with me. RADIO TIMES / Stella Papamichael - POSITIVEI thought the film had huge visceral impact, great performances inc. Logan Lerman. A bit 'Hollywood' in parts, but this will be getting a solid 4 stars for Radio Times. THE LIST / Emma Simmonds – POSITIVEI thought the film was great, appropriately brutal, moving and exciting.

TOTAL FILM / Richard Jordan – POSITIVEThanks for having me along to the screening last night. I thought the film was great – super-intense and authentic, it was kind of an assault on the senses (in a good way), the story and script were tight and the performances were fantastic across the board. In my opinion it's the best film David Ayer has made yet and I reckon it's going to be up there with some of the best war movies. DAZED & CONFUSED / DAZED DIGITAL / Trey Taylor – POSITIVEI absolutely loved it - Logan is an undisputed star! THE GUARDIAN / Catherine Shoard – POSITIVEI thought it was really interesting! Loads of fodder for stories, v gripping and well played (Pitt esp) tho sometimes seemed to slip slightly into cliche. Four stars I reckon. THE GUARDIAN / Henry Barnes – POSITIVE / MIXEDI liked it. Pitt was great. The atmosphere was believably miserable and I am glad it wasn't sanitised. Lerman did a decent job with a slight part. On the other hand: the depiction of the Germans was over-worked to the point of being insulting, the supporting characters were too broad, the ending strayed from the gritty realism we'd been given up to that point. Edging on a 4 star. SHORTLIST / Andrew Dickens – POSITIVEI was going to say I really enjoyed it, but that's definitely the wrong verb. I thought it was very good. Ambitious, honest and as brutal, intense portrayal of WW2 as I have ever seen. There were a couple of cheesy moments and I'd question the pace and distance of Norman's descent into lusting killer, but maybe that happened. Also, I was slightly disappointed that, having been shot four times (which didn't seem to affect him much), then inside a tank with two exploding grenades, then left dead for several hours, Brad Pitt looked like he was having a nap, with perfect hair and a slight skin rash. Considering the gore levels elsewhere, I think it was a bit of a cop out and more realism would've served to make a more impactful final scene. That aside, great performances all round, particular Shia L and Jon B, in what really felt like an old-fashioned war film with 21st century levels of realism. GOOD MORNING BRITAIN (ITV1) / Nick Rylance - POSITIVEIt's incredible I loved it. Tense, gripping, moving, jumpy, compelling to watch. Terrific performances.Probably the best war film I've seen in many years - opens up a whole area I knew nothing about, and a story well worth telling. Edge of my seat. A great cinematic experience. HEAT / THE GUARDIAN / Charles Gant – POSITIVEI liked it, strong performances, nicely delineated characters and effectively plunges you into the battle, ie very evocatively filmed. Scene with the two women was a nice counterpoint.I've always thought Logan Lerman was an underrated actor, so nice to see him being entrusted with this role.The depiction of the final heroic act (one Sherman tank v an entire SS battalion) seems so specific, you want it to be based on something that actually happened in reality, otherwise you feel like it's a Boy's Own fantasy, and I'm not sure what exactly the film is saying.The overall setting -- the SS forcing women and children to fight in the dying weeks of the war or face being strung up as a coward -- does give it a firm anchor. FREELANCE / THE INDEPENDENT / METRO – James Mottram – POSITIVEI have to say, I thought it was pretty amazing. Brutal, gritty, terrifying - quite a watch really. One of Brad's best. Even Shia wasn't annoying! And Logan L. was excellent...it's his film really. FREELANCE / SUNDAY TIMES CULTURE – Ryan Gilbey – MIXEDI wasn't nuts about it. It was spectacularly shot, especially the final battle. The cinematography was really rich and vivid. But I think there was a personality crisis in the film between two types of filmmaking. I couldn;t understand why David Ayer went to all that considerable trouble to make it authentic and explicit - from the horrible first scene to various icky details like the bodies being flattened by tanks - only to then smother the movie in the most awful corny syrupy score, which basically undermined the gritty effect. It's like it wanted to be both Come & See AND The Dirty Dozen (Saving Private Ryan had the same problem but not as bad). And it was a bit of a Nazi-killing wet-dream videogame. The only German soldier who came close to being an actual character was the conveniently nice one who spares Norman. Inglourious Basterds may have been a fantasy but even that showed that there were brave Germans too. Anyway, that's my take. LITTLE WHITE LIES / Adam Woodward – MIXEDI must say I thought the action sequences were incredible, some of the best I've seen since Band of Brothers. But story wise I felt it laid it on a little thick. METRO / ELLE / FREELANCE / Anna Smith – POSITIVE/MIXEDI thought it was a very interesting film, powerful and a brave perspective on the inhumanity of war and its affect on men. Visually very strong. Good performances.I had an issue with the scene with the women, however. It felt as if potentially non consensual sex was being presented in a positive and even humorous light.Aside from that, great FREELANCE / Joe Utichi – POSITIVEI absolutely loved it. Pitt and especially Lerman were terrific and the film did what I haven’t seen a WW2 picture do since Saving Private Ryan: give me a new perspective on that conflict. It wasn’t so dour as to be inaccessible either, but boy did it not shirk in being honest about the horror. Brilliantly executed and so gripping. I am desperate to see it again!!! DAILY TELEGRAPH / Ross Jones - POSITIVEsorry for delayed reaction – I’m still recovering. It was possibly the most intense WW2 film I’ve seen, which I mean as a compliment. Logan is incredible, as you all said he was, and all the grime and dirt just oozed off the screen. And I still have a knot in my stomach thinking about the battle with the Tiger. And last 20 minutes. And even the dinner table scene, for that matter, so, an awesome achievement really.",Private

Have you been able to speak with production to see of they can build in a hiatus or otherwise minimize the cost if we need Brad the full week of October 13-20. I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity. In that scenario maybe we would try to tack on a few hours of work at the end of August when he's at Bovington for long lead euro press. How",Private
"Please find below a brief summary of the Ukrainian reviews for FURY: Alexei Pershko, Kino-teatr.ua, POSITIVE 7/10“Fury” is simple, as the angle of the house, harsh, and pretty bloody.http://kino-teatr.ua/review/Fury-II-2752.phtml Vitaly Vaschuk, Kino-teatr.ua, POSITIVE 7/10Of course, despite all the praises, the film doesn’t cease to be a Hollywood craft, and we fully partake of pathos, and a tear just yet be obliged to roll after the fallen American soldiers. But even this doesn’t change anything, the film is simply required for viewing.http://kino-teatr.ua/review/Fury-II-2755.phtml Tania Tuka, blogger, POSITIVE 9/10If in the beginning, ""Fury"" resembles a typical predictable Hollywood movie, even though the theme, then at the end you realize that it is a realistic historical thriller.http://taniatuka.blogspot.com/2014/10/blog-post_23.html Tetiana Narozhna, Pulse of Kiev, POSITIVE 8/10Despite the abundance of the battle scenes, the sea of blood and death, the film is not about the war. The film is about life.http://leisure.puls.kiev.ua/showbiz/288618.html Elena Strelbitskaya, kinofilms.ua, MIXED 6/10David Ayre made a pretty strong, but heavy enough movie. This is not the best, but the outspoken film about the war. And it is unlikely to want to watch it for a second time.http://www.kinofilms.ua/movie/59645_Fury/review/?review=738 Katerina Lebedeva, sutki.net, POSITIVE 7/10Difficult but very interesting movie.http://sutki.net/films/58784-bred_pitt_v_tanke_ne_schitaya_labafa.html Irina Yuschenko, blogger, POSITIVE 8/10Impressive realism, and military advisers did their best. Of course, there are elements of a purely American movies, but in general all is very authentic. A sense of humor to defuse - was simply escape. And there will be no ""happy ending"", because ""the war has no winners.""http://8zelenoglazaya8.livejournal.com/439398.html Mariya Nazarenko, 7buttons.kiev.ua, MIXED 6/10I would describe it as ""anatomy of war"".

It doesn’t have usual “lacquer”, but there is blood, dirt, pain and tears. And drunken rough tankers.http://carabaas.livejournal.com/14298087.html Irina Pestova, blogger, POSITIVE 7/10This movie will forever change your view of the war.http://irinalexa.livejournal.com/69974.html",Private
"Memorandum To: DistributionFrom: Ileen Reich and Angela GalganiDate: September 26, 2014 RE: Fury / Screening Reactions #4Below, please find screening reactions on behalf of Fury. New reactions are in bold. Krista Smith/ VANITY FAIR (additional reaction)Krista thought it was so great to see Brad Pitt carry a movie again. She thought his performance was fantastic. She said that ironically for her, the freshness from the film was Shia LaBeouf. He is the heart of the movie. She liked that God was his justification for what they’re doing. She found that part fascinating, where she wanted to see more of that from the other characters. She would have been fine with 10 or 15 more minutes added to the movie if it allowed her to become better acquainted with each character. She loved the action and the realness of the film; however, she felt the script was lacking and there wasn’t much freshness to it. For instance, she didn’t understand the “Best Job I ever had” line. While she thought Logan Lerman’s character was phenomenal, she felt that Jon Bernthal’s character was reduced to a caricature and that Michael Pen’s character felt too modern. She thought that perhaps it was the dialogue written for him, but it didn’t feel like he was from 1945. As for the ending scene, she found it rather unbelievable. While the film felt so realistic throughout its entirety, she thought that Norman should have either been killed by the German soldier or had the savvy to survive. For her, it seemed unrealistic that the German soldier was willing to spare Norman’s life after he and the four other guys mauled down almost 300 Nazis. All-in-all, she thinks the movie will do very well commercially because it’s Brad Pitt. Currently, she is undecided on a best picture nomination.. she can’t completely rule it out. For Golden Globes, she thinks Brad Pitt and the film will definitely receive nominations. She would give the film a solid B+. Krista really liked the movie. She said she “wanted more of it.” Not more of the violence, but more of the story. She thought that Shia LaBeouf’s performance was fantastic. She did think Brad Pitt was great and really liked the scene in the apartment with the girls. Elena Howe/ LA TIMESElena said she liked the film a lot. However, she said it wasn’t quite as unique of a story as she had expected. She did say it was gripping and well acted. She thinks the film is worthy of some Oscar campaigning but didn’t elaborate any further. Elena added: “I think Logan Lerman in supporting for sure, Brad Pitt for lead… picture and director might be worthwhile as well given that there’s no clear frontrunner yet.” Jane Sarkin / VANITY FAIRJane loved the film and Brad Pitt. She said all of the performances are perfect and Logan Lerman is a revelation. The battle scenes are long and intense which are very important yet unpleasant. Lisa Hintelmann / ESQUIREAlthough this is not Lisa’s favorite genre, she did like the film and thought that Brad Pitt was terrific – it is a very complex character and he does an incredible job showing all of the varying traits: he is both brutal and tender at the same time; a father figure of sorts but not in an overbearing or clichéd way. Though she liked the supporting performances none of them stood out for her. The film is very well done and David Ayer does a great job at making a very intimate film about a very big thing and it works very well. The battle scenes are extremely visceral bringing the audience right to the frontlines of the war. She said the strongest scene is the apartment scene and she loved Alicia von Rittberg as Emma saying she reminded her of Abbie Cornish and Lea Seydoux. Lisa is a huge fan of End of Watch and how real and deep the relationship between Michael Pena and Jake Gyllenhaal is and hoped to see that in Fury. Unfortunately, though they speak of it throughout the film, she never truly got the feeling of camaraderie between the guys in the tank and she had hoped to. Andrea Oliveri / DETAILSAndrea liked FURY and felt that it was a solid B+/A-. In addition to the performances, the cinematography, editing and effects were all top notch. She thought though the beginning was a bit slow, the story was strong and really picked up once Logan’s character was introduced. She said at first it seemed like a varied mix with the supporting actors, but she felt they all worked really well together which cements the fact that Brad Pitt is an amazing actor. Andrea commented that Shia LaBeouf is immensely talented and she LOVED Jon Bernthal. She also felt that Logan Lerman has such a great range and was extremely believable. Logan Lerman’s first shooting scene was a favorite as was Shia LaBeouf praying with the dying soldier. She loved the scene with the women in the German house – you really understood Wardaddy’s role in the story and how protective he was of Norman. She felt the tension was great when the rest of the squad came in drunk. All of the relationships in the film are complicated and interesting especially the brotherly bond between Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena and Shia LaBeouf -- and Brad Pitt definitely inhabited the role of Wardaddy. Andrea loved that he looked older and weathered which made him even more believable in the role. Kathy Heintzelman / FREELANCEKathy said she would count herself as a David Ayer fan – she really liked End of Watch. She thought Fury was well done, overall but it wasn't her favorite film this year. She would give the film a B. She said got very mixed messages from it -- and maybe that's realistic and commendable, but it felt a little manipulative to her. For example, a lot of it sends the ""war is hell"" message, but by the final standoff, with the swelling music, it seemed like this was the greatest job and the greatest camaraderie these guys were ever going to have (they even say as much). “Maybe that's the way battle really is, I don't know; or maybe that's the way it felt to the Greatest Generation in a war where there was a much clearer sense of good and evil.” But she thought it undercut the moral dilemmas the young newbie was wrestling with in the first half of the film. To her there were two standout sequences -- the one where the two tanks are battling each other, and the one in the house in the German town with the two women. In the tank sequence, she was really engaged with the mechanics of the battle in ways she wasn't during the final sequence. And the German town scene was just... weird in an interesting way. She couldn't quite buy that the other guys from the tank would be that harassing when their chief was clearly upset by their behavior. Or why he didn't just tell them to knock it off. Kathy didn't understand the dynamics there, but it was interesting and a nice break from battle scenes. The way the gunshots were indicated with colored laser-like bursts distracted her-- she felt it seemed cartoonish or video-game-ish. Kathy did mention for all she knows that's the way it really looks on the battlefield, but again, it sent a kind of mixed message. Kathy liked the acting although thought the characters were sort of stock. What happened with the newbie seemed obvious from the beginning -- if he didn't die early on he'd end up the way he did. And, it was hard to forget that that was Brad Pitt -- no fault of his acting, but he was a figurehead or symbol more than an actual character. She wouldn't have minded learning a little more about him and some of the others, but, that's a staple of old WWII movies that Ayer avoided. Although she would have liked just a little more. Pete Hammond/Deadline HollywoodPete said he could not believe how good the film was. He mentioned he is a big David Ayer fan. He thought all the performances were great, especially Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. “Do not count out Brad Pitt this year . “ He said the film is definitely in the Best Picture race -- especially a push for all of the crafts and not to forget that the Academy loves a war movie. Roger Durling/Executive Director Santa Barbara Film FestivalRoger was visibly moved and completely shaken after the screening, and on the spot invited the film to screen at the Festival’s Cinema Society. He said the film had so much humanity and there was never a false note. He loved the authenticity and texture of the film and was very inquisitive about how it was shot. He was a fan of both Logan Lerman and Brad Pitt’s performances and noted it was career shifting role for Shia (in light of his recent press). He was incredibly enthusiastic in his reaction. Timothy Blake/President of SAG Film SocietyShe said it was an incredible ensemble performance. It was all about the work-it was all up there on the screen. Everyone one of the actors gave an amazing performance. She feels that Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman were standouts and gave Award caliber performances. Going in she felt this would skew more male, but after seeing it, and they way she personally felt, she feels women will respond to it as well. She thinks the film has a good chance to be nominated for SAG ensemble. Tim Gray/VarietyHe thinks this is a new level of achievement for Brad Pitt. He is a big supporter of the film. Especially noted the Cinematography and Steven Price’s score. Peter Travers/ Rolling StonePeter really liked the movie. He thinks we are a lock for Logan Lerman in supporting and we should be able to get one of the Best Picture slots. He thought the film had excellent below the line chances, as well. He thought Brad Pitt was fantastic, but reminded us, the lead category is just very competitive this year. Peter felt David Ayer did a terrific job at showing the humanity in war. He loved the dinner scene and loved that the German soldier didn’t kill Logan at the end. Peter expected the movie to be much more gratuitous, but was pleased it was not. To him if felt very human, very emotional and very real. He felt you don’t leave the film feeling despondent -- you actually feel like things happened for a reason. He said the film moved at a swift pace and held his interest throughout. Dave Karger/FANDANGODave enjoyed the movie and said that it would be included in his top 15 picks of the year, but not yet in his top 10. He thought it was a B+ film if he were rating it. He thought the performances were powerful, but noted that this is a very strong year for males and it will be tough for actor nominations. Dave said that the film started a little slow for him, but once they got into the apartment with the two women, it took off and he was emotionally invested. He said that the film could have a below-the-line push for the crafts categories. Elvis Mitchell/INTERVIEWElvis thought the scene in the house is an extraordinary sequence. He said that while it seems digressive, it's completely pushing the story forward in emotional and narrative terms and we know who each of those guys are in that house. He thought it is refreshing to see a movie in which tension is subject of a movie in the most subtle way possible, and in which PTSD is illustrated as texture rather than declaimed as a story point.",Private
"Re: Fury - Urgent have you seen the movie On Jul 28, 2014, at 9:52 AM, Taylor, Peter wrote: Dear Doug We do need to go back to the Festival in a day or so. You are correct regarding the opening/closing for 2013. Captain Phillips went on to gross a terrific £16.2m, our biggest film of the year. Saving Mr Banks delivered £4.4m, a disappointing gross as much a result of the release date as the campaign. Fury is certainly closer to the first movie here, not just in style but in its fit for the UK market. The reviews for our movie were very good indeed and those for Disney were good without being exceptional overall. For Fury we think we are in 4 star territory and the prestige of the closing night will surely position the film in exactly the way we would hope. As it falls within our opening week the issue of early reviews is not a concern.

Suffice to say they loved its integrity, human involvement and its straight forward intent to appeal to a broad audience. We would of course be happy to go back with a yes please however we do need to confirm talent access and whether we intend to pursue other festivals. Last year on Captain Phillips we found ourselves in a very compromising position where goal posts kept moving and our relationship with the LFF became untenable. We do need to go back to them with a clear remit of our intention, whatever it may be, however a world premiere of a movie shot in the UK with such a universal message must surely be a convincing argument. For the Festival we are pretty much close to the wire on deadline and would love to confirm asap. It is a marvellous opportunity to be embraced in every way. Regards Peter",Private

There are some comments from the internet movie-forums: · All is in the high level. And the feeling of the participation effect at the champ of battle is with you during whole the movie. And the real tanks - that’s something incredible. Will advise this movie to all for watching! · It is very strong movie and up to date for all the Ukrainians, parallel guides of the battle between the truth and the Evil Empire.

"Re: Fury publicity Of course I'm not suggesting that we tell Seth that we want to move Interview so we can put Fury on 10/17. But we just did a similar thing when we moved ASM3 out of June, put S Six in Nov '16 and took the open date for Uncharted. No one was tweaked. I don't think we have the same risk here, so I'm sure we can put a few days between the two moves, but all's I'm saying is that by doing it in one official announcement we look smart and strategic.

I agree with him. The bottom line is that regardless of the on-going negotiation over Brad’s travel to the US, the LFF closing night is happening on 10/19, and we have that weekend (the 18th and 19th) cleared in his diary.

Have you been able to speak with production to see of they can build in a hiatus or otherwise minimize the cost if we need Brad the full week of October 13-20. I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity. In that scenario maybe we would try to tack on a few hours of work at the end of August when he's at Bovington f",Private
"RE: Fury - Urgent Dear Doug We do need to go back to the Festival in a day or so. You are correct regarding the opening/closing for 2013. Captain Phillips went on to gross a terrific £16.2m, our biggest film of the year. Saving Mr Banks delivered £4.4m, a disappointing gross as much a result of the release date as the campaign. Fury is certainly closer to the first movie here, not just in style but in its fit for the UK market. The reviews for our movie were very good indeed and those for Disney were good without being exceptional overall. For Fury we think we are in 4 star territory and the prestige of the closing night will surely position the film in exactly the way we would hope. As it falls within our opening week the issue of early reviews is not a concern.

Suffice to say they loved its integrity, human involvement and its straight forward intent to appeal to a broad audience. We would of course be happy to go back with a yes please however we do need to confirm talent access and whether we intend to pursue other festivals. Last year on Captain Phillips we found ourselves in a very compromising position where goal posts kept moving and our relationship with the LFF became untenable. We do need to go back to them with a clear remit of our intention, whatever it may be, however a world premiere of a movie shot in the UK with such a universal message must surely be a convincing argument. For the Festival we are pretty much close to the wire on deadline and would love to confirm asap. It is a marvellous opportunity to be embraced in every way. Regards Peter",Private

His response below raises a number of key points of concern for the business in general along with his belief that with the lead time between the local date and the US date, the activities are not sufficient.

If the US date is Nov 14, Friday, and Pioneer is going on Nov 12, 2 days earlier Than USA, the anti cam plan would seem adequate provided that they cover Wed to Sun, to protect the USA market. The extent of coverage seem to be at par with what we would do, to protect for anticam for 5 days. But this plan seem inadequate for 21 days. I am also equally concerned with the message we are sending Exhibitors by letting Pioneer pay SM for anticam operation. It is a bad precedent. It will just monetize exhibitor anticam operations which is against our thrust---ANTICAM IS AN EXHIBITOR RESPONSIBILTY AND NOT OURs (DISTRIBUTOR'S or PRODUCERS). Pioneer's and SM's interest will be mainly opportunistic. They will never have the same intent to protect the property like we do. I will oppose going ahead and insist to go day and date, or 2 days earlier than USA at best. My comments on this overall anticam plans as follows: Krisnha of SM sent a letter listing their participation- A. SM will use the same anticam resources and procedures they have developed with us and mpa. THIS SHOULD BE GOOD. SM is set up and uses its own resources. We should re-enforce this and NOT ENCOURAGE them to demand payment for anticam operations like a service they render to protect our property. B. SM will work with Optical Media Board, National Cinema Association, Anti Piracy Council, phil Natl Police, etc. We always try to work with these Agencies. The anti film piracy council have participated when they can but the others dont have funding or are waiting for funding or a political Agenda. C. SM will work with Genric Holding Limited, the MPA representative in the Philippines, who will use night vision goggles during screening sessions to prevent any occurrence of illegal camcording in our theatres across metro Manila and the surrounding provinces. We work with Genric all the time but their coverage is very limited and not significant due to their cost. We only use what is on retainer or what is Free. GENRIC covers 2 to 3 days and only 2 to 3 locations in Metro-Manila, they dont cover out of city limits because Genric rates are in US Dollars based. If we had FURY, we'd be out in 132 locations and in 150 to 200 screens. Genric will cover only 3 to 4 locations 3 days of the 5 day weekend and we will cover up to 20+ Locations for 5 days. I would question the scope of Genric's participation which, in my experience have been very limited and more of a ""must use"" because its part of the deal and already paid for. We rarely expand their scope and instead use our own checking/anti-camcord team which will cover more for the same money Genric charges. Wilson says they will contribute $30k to $50k to SM or is Pioneer funding the other gov't and semi gov't Agencies to participate? If so, it will a bad precedent if Pioneer will be paying cash SM or the funds for anticam efforts. And this is the amount typically spent for 5 days, definitely NOT Adequate for 21 days, as they are proposing.

To site a recent example, we recently released Maleficent for Sony Pictures as well as Transformers: Age of Extinction, several weeks before the United States, and no camcording incidents were reported. Furthermore, the Philippines was recently removed from the 2014 Special 301 Watch List, which is a testament to the efforts that we as a community are making in preventing camcording occurrences. SM Supermalls is working closely with the Optical Media Board, the Philippine National Police, the National Cinema Association of the Philippines, and the Motion Picture Anti-Film Piracy Council in a combined effort to prevent camcording occurrences. We have discussed Sony’s concerns internally and SM Supermalls, in conjunction with Pioneer, are prepared to utlizie the following anti-camcording prevention techniques in our theatres to ensure that camcording does not occur: · We will engage Genric Holding Limited, the MPA representative in the Philippines, who will use night vision goggles during screening sessions to prevent any occurrence of illegal camcording in our theatres across metro Manila and the surrounding provinces. Sony should be familiar with Genric as we have used them to prevent camcording on recent Sony films. · We will have 2 guards and 1 usher wearing clearly marked anti-piracy security vests for every theatre in our cinemas screening the movie. · We will inform our cinema employees to be on high alert and reiterate our standard protocol for reporting camcording incidents including notifying the appropriate cinema manager, calling the police, and stopping the movie in session. · We always have 2 civilian guards who roam around our cinemas and take seats beside those individuals suspected of potential camcording. · We will have signs located at all the entrances to the cinemas, outside the ticket booth, and in front of the specific theatres playing the movie with anti-camcording warning messages. · We will have an anti-camcording video being played in every theatre. This video is through the help of our anti-film piracy council. Overall, our annual budget for security measures used to fight camcording has increased by 400%. We have been receiving intel from the MPAA regarding the releases, which helps us to be on high alert. Attached are some of the photos taken at the Mall of Asia.

"Fwd: Fury - camcording Steven - I shared this with Victor to get his local perspective. His response below raises a number of key points of concern for the business in general along with his belief that with the lead time between the local date and the US date, the activities are not sufficient. Victor feels that the coverage considered would be ok for a release two days before the US but nothing longer. Definitely not enough for 3 weeks before the US. I support his recommendation. It will be a significant risk for this OV market. Brett. Begin forwarded message: From: ""Cabrera, Vic"" <Vic.Cabrera@disney.com> Date: 15 July, 2014 12:05:39 am GMT+8 To: ""Hogg, Brett"" <Brett_Hogg@spe.sony.com> Subject: Re: Fury - camcording Brett, This is a different Wilson (YuloQue) of Pioneer from Wilson(Tieng) of Solar. If the US date is Nov 14, Friday, and Pioneer is going on Nov 12, 2 days earlier Than USA, the anti cam plan would seem adequate provided that they cover Wed to Sun, to protect the USA market. The extent of coverage seem to be at par with what we would do, to protect for anticam for 5 days. But this plan seem inadequate for 21 days. I am also equally concerned with the message we are sending Exhibitors by letting Pioneer pay SM for anticam operation. It is a bad precedent. It will just monetize exhibitor anticam operations which is against our thrust---ANTICAM IS AN EXHIBITOR RESPONSIBILTY AND NOT OURs (DISTRIBUTOR'S or PRODUCERS). Pioneer's and SM's interest will be mainly opportunistic. They will never have the same intent to protect the property like we do. I will oppose going ahead and insist to go day and date, or 2 days earlier than USA at best. My comments on this overall anticam plans as follows: Krisnha of SM sent a letter listing their participation- A. SM will use the same anticam resources and procedures they have developed with us and mpa. THIS SHOULD BE GOOD. SM is set up and uses its own resources. We should re-enforce this and NOT ENCOURAGE them to demand payment for anticam operations like a service they render to protect our property. B. SM will work with Optical Media Board, National Cinema Association, Anti Piracy Council, phil Natl Police, etc. We always try to work with these Agencies. The anti film piracy council have participated when they can but the others dont have funding or are waiting for funding or a political Agenda. C. SM will work with Genric Holding Limited, the MPA representative in the Philippines, who will use night vision goggles during screening sessions to prevent any occurrence of illegal camcording in our theatres across metro Manila and the surrounding provinces. We work with Genric all the time but their coverage is very limited and not significant due to their cost. We only use what is on retainer or what is Free. GENRIC covers 2 to 3 days and only 2 to 3 locations in Metro-Manila, they dont cover out of city limits because Genric rates are in US Dollars based. If we had FURY, we'd be out in 132 locations and in 150 to 200 screens. Genric will cover only 3 to 4 locations 3 days of the 5 day weekend and we will cover up to 20+ Locations for 5 days. I would question the scope of Genric's participation which, in my experience have been very limited and more of a ""must use"" because its part of the deal and already paid for. We rarely expand their scope and instead use our own checking/anti-camcord team which will cover more for the same money Genric charges. Wilson says they will contribute $30k to $50k to SM or is Pioneer funding the other gov't and semi gov't Agencies to participate? If so, it will a bad precedent if Pioneer will be paying cash SM or the funds for anticam efforts. And this is the amount typically spent for 5 days, definitely NOT Adequate for 21 days, as they are proposing.

LE FIGARO – François Menia / POSITIVE The film is excellent. Brad Pitt and all the other actors act very well. There isn’t one acting better than another. The directing is perfect. I think David Ayer’s directing is really on the mark, and he achieved exactly what he wanted to.” JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE/Stephanie Belpeche/ POSITIVEWe just screened a grand film. I even preferred it to Saving Private Ryan. No sentimentalism a la spielberg; no close ups; just raw, dry, mud and , urine, the film is organic. I was very moved. I love David Ayer’s approach to films ; I was expecting another war film and this one is a great surprise. Even the way they die takes us by surprise. France 2 TV / Cultural editor/ POSITIVEI liked it alot. A pretty astounding piece of directing work played by very good actors POSITIF/ Philippe Rouyer/ POSITIVEI really loved this film. It’s like a Samuel Fuller film TELERAMA. Fr , Cultural weekly website / POSITIVEI rather liked it. It’s a solid classic war film. OUI FM radio/ MIXED POSITIVEI found the film uneven. The beginning is great but the end goes in all directions. In the 1st part there is a real tension, a real ‘behind the scenes’ of the war which I find really very good, but the sequence at the local’s home and the epic-apocalyptic ending made me disconnect. I need to think about it to mature my judgment. Les INROCKUPTIBLES trendy cultural weekly / MIXED NEGATIVE I’m a little mixed, I found the film remarkably well directed. I’m bothered by the forced patriotism (that’s not really an issue) but especially by all the references to Christ, portrayed by Shia Labeouf whose performance isn’t good. I have trouble with the Bible verses and heroism at the end; that said, David Ayer is a talented director, but we already knew that.

Michel Ciment, key opinion maker, director of respected institutional movie magazine” POSITIF”/POSITIVE “An excellent film, the best war movie I’ve seen since a very long time. One of the most authentic films on the war. A terrific directing job by David Ayer; the scene with the 2 German women is simply remarkable, a commanding scene. The 3 rd quality of the film is that one does not find any pleasure in the scenes where men are killed, it’s the message that war is terrible. For me, this film is on the same level as Full Metal Jacket.”Aurélien Allin and Spadacenta, movie journalists from movie monthly « CINEMATEASER »/POSITIVE“Good, really good. We were expecting even more violence as in David Ayer’s previous films” Marylin Letertre / METRO FREE DAILY/POSITIVE“A great film. Some expected scenes (suicide mission) or surprises (the lunch scene at the German’s house – all the guys are bastards without exception) there is a real tension in that scene”Sylvestre Picard/ PREMIERE movie monthly /POSITIVE“I really like it; a lot of dead on screen, a lot of tension ...""Xavier le Harpeur – STUDIO CINE LIVE/POSITIVE Great!""Thomas Colpaert / TELE 2 SEMAINE/POSITIVE/MIXED “A good film, maybe too talkative” From: Tesser-Marquez, Amy Sent: Monday, September 29, 2014 10:00 AMTo: Pascal, Amy; Belgrad, Doug; Minghella, Hannah; DeLuca, Michael; Clark, Nigel; van der Werff, Susan; ODell, Steven; Alexander, Ralph; Bruer, Rory; Caines, Dwight; Kaminow, David; Plishner, Elias; Napoli, Stefanie; Renz, Sandro; Caraco, Andre; Reich, Ileen; 'bblock@qedintl.com'; 'jl@grisbiprod.com'; 'jhegeman@qedintl.com'; 'alex@cravefilms.com'; 'jbing@bingcommunications.net'Cc: Mandrell, AjaSubject: FURY / FRENCH Screening Reactions Below please find a couple of reactions from this morning’s first press screening in Paris. Samuel Blumenfeld, LE MONDE daily (like NY Times) / POSITIVE “I found the film extremely well directed. All the cast are excellent. Especially Logan Lerman who I find even better than BP. But BP is always excellent. It’s very fluid in terms of directing. I didn’t see the 2 hours go by at all. Just the end is a little like “Fort Alamo” but the qualities of the film by far surpass my mixed feeling at the end” Pierre Rissient, Producer, and talent discoverer , very influential within the critic’s sphere in Paris /POSITIVE – mixed just for the end“a film much more ballsy than any other, one couldn’t have done that in the 50’s (Samuel Fuller “The Big red one”, or “The Bold and the Brave); David Ayer’s directing is excellent. The film has great qualities. Besides being realistic, actually the end is not so realistic. The end is ambivalent. So except for the last 20 minutes which are ambivalent, I liked it a lot. It’s surprising that BP’s character is so cultivated and should have been implemented at the beginning of the film. When he declares that ideals are peaceful, history is violent. Logan Lerman is even better than BP. All the actors are excellent.”",Private
"Re: Fury publicity I know that we want to make the decision on Interview and notify those filmmakers first without linking it to the Fury decision. But if we announce Interview separately, won't that create an opportunity for a reshuffling of dates and allow another picture to move into 10/10 potentially disrupting the logic behind the 10.17 date? (although maybe any reshuffle will benefit us…I guess two possibilities are that Gone Girl goes a week later or Dracula goes a week earlier) Should we hold an official announcement until we're ready to make both moves and announce them simultaneously.

I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity. In that scenario maybe we would try to tack on a few hours of work at the end of August when he's",Private

To site a recent example, we recently released Maleficent for Sony Pictures as well as Transformers: Age of Extinction, several weeks before the United States, and no camcording incidents were reported. Furthermore, the Philippines was recently removed from the 2014 Special 301 Watch List, which is a testament to the efforts that we as a community are making in preventing camcording occurrences.

We have discussed Sony’s concerns internally and SM Supermalls, in conjunction with Pioneer, are prepared to utlizie the following anti-camcording prevention techniques in our theatres to ensure that camcording does not occur: · We will engage Genric Holding Limited, the MPA representative in the Philippines, who will use night vision goggles during screening sessions to prevent any occurrence of illegal camcording in our theatres across metro Manila and the surrounding provinces. Sony should be familiar with Genric as we have used them to prevent camcording on recent Sony films. · We will have 2 guards and 1 usher wearing clearly marked anti-piracy security vests for every theatre in our cinemas screening the movie. · We will inform our cinema employees to be on high alert and reiterate our standard protocol for reporting camcording incidents including notifying the appropriate cinema manager, calling the police, and stopping the movie in session. · We always have 2 civilian guards who roam around our cinemas and take seats beside those individuals suspected of potential camcording. · We will have signs located at all the entrances to the cinemas, outside the ticket booth, and in front of the specific theatres playing the movie with anti-camcording warning messages. · We will have an anti-camcording video being played in every theatre. This video is through the help of our anti-film piracy council. Overall, our annual budget for security measures used to fight camcording has increased by 400%. We have been receiving intel from the MPAA regarding the releases, which helps us to be on high alert. Attached are some of the photos taken at the Mall of Asia.

"Re: Fury publicity I have spoken to Clare at the LFF who is delighted with the news. Nigel - per your other email he would not be expected to sit through or attend the closing party. It's all about the red carpet and their admiration of the film itself. Steven - the Festival would understand if a couple of territories in Asia went Oct 17 however they would of course prefer to be the first outside of the US (or world premiere should the Domestic date not come forward). With their patience and understanding this year,and more so last year, I do feel it might be a worthy gesture if those territories could hold back.

"Memorandum To: DistributionFrom: Ileen Reich and Angela GalganiDate: September 24, 2014 RE: Fury / Screening Reactions #3Below, please find screening reactions on behalf of Fury. New reactions are in bold. Elena Howe/ LA TIMESElena said she liked the film a lot. However, she said it wasn’t quite as unique of a story as she had expected. She did say it was gripping and well acted. She thinks the film is worthy of some Oscar campaigning but didn’t elaborate any further. Andrea Oliveri / DETAILSAndrea liked FURY and felt that it was a solid B+/A-. In addition to the performances, the cinematography, editing and effects were all top notch. She thought though the beginning was a bit slow, the story was strong and really picked up once Logan’s character was introduced. She said at first it seemed like a varied mix with the supporting actors, but she felt they all worked really well together which cements the fact that Brad Pitt is an amazing actor. Andrea commented that Shia LaBeouf is immensely talented and she LOVED Jon Bernthal. She also felt that Logan Lerman has such a great range and was extremely believable. Logan Lerman’s first shooting scene was a favorite as was Shia LaBeouf praying with the dying soldier. She loved the scene with the women in the German house – you really understood Wardaddy’s role in the story and how protective he was of Norman. She felt the tension was great when the rest of the squad came in drunk. All of the relationships in the film are complicated and interesting especially the brotherly bond between Jon Bernthal, Michael Pena and Shia LaBeouf -- and Brad Pitt definitely inhabited the role of Wardaddy. Andrea loved that he looked older and weathered which made him even more believable in the role. Kathy Heintzelman / FREELANCEKathy said she would count herself as a David Ayer fan – she really liked End of Watch. She thought Fury was well done, overall but it wasn't her favorite film this year. She would give the film a B. She said got very mixed messages from it -- and maybe that's realistic and commendable, but it felt a little manipulative to her. For example, a lot of it sends the ""war is hell"" message, but by the final standoff, with the swelling music, it seemed like this was the greatest job and the greatest camaraderie these guys were ever going to have (they even say as much). “Maybe that's the way battle really is, I don't know; or maybe that's the way it felt to the Greatest Generation in a war where there was a much clearer sense of good and evil.” But she thought it undercut the moral dilemmas the young newbie was wrestling with in the first half of the film. To her there were two standout sequences -- the one where the two tanks are battling each other, and the one in the house in the German town with the two women. In the tank sequence, she was really engaged with the mechanics of the battle in ways she wasn't during the final sequence. And the German town scene was just... weird in an interesting way. She couldn't quite buy that the other guys from the tank would be that harassing when their chief was clearly upset by their behavior. Or why he didn't just tell them to knock it off. Kathy didn't understand the dynamics there, but it was interesting and a nice break from battle scenes. The way the gunshots were indicated with colored laser-like bursts distracted her-- she felt it seemed cartoonish or video-game-ish. Kathy did mention for all she knows that's the way it really looks on the battlefield, but again, it sent a kind of mixed message. Kathy liked the acting although thought the characters were sort of stock. What happened with the newbie seemed obvious from the beginning -- if he didn't die early on he'd end up the way he did. And, it was hard to forget that that was Brad Pitt -- no fault of his acting, but he was a figurehead or symbol more than an actual character. She wouldn't have minded learning a little more about him and some of the others, but, that's a staple of old WWII movies that Ayer avoided. Although she would have liked just a little more. Pete Hammond/Deadline HollywoodPete said he could not believe how good the film was. He mentioned he is a big David Ayer fan. He thought all the performances were great, especially Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. “Do not count out Brad Pitt this year . “ He said the film is definitely in the Best Picture race -- especially a push for all of the crafts and not to forget that the Academy loves a war movie. Roger Durling/Executive Director Santa Barbara Film FestivalRoger was visibly moved and completely shaken after the screening, and on the spot invited the film to screen at the Festival’s Cinema Society. He said the film had so much humanity and there was never a false note. He loved the authenticity and texture of the film and was very inquisitive about how it was shot. He was a fan of both Logan Lerman and Brad Pitt’s performances and noted it was career shifting role for Shia (in light of his recent press). He was incredibly enthusiastic in his reaction. Timothy Blake/President of SAG Film SocietyShe said it was an incredible ensemble performance. It was all about the work-it was all up there on the screen. Everyone one of the actors gave an amazing performance. She feels that Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman were standouts and gave Award caliber performances. Going in she felt this would skew more male, but after seeing it, and they way she personally felt, she feels women will respond to it as well. She thinks the film has a good chance to be nominated for SAG ensemble. Tim Gray/VarietyHe thinks this is a new level of achievement for Brad Pitt. He is a big supporter of the film. Especially noted the Cinematography and Steven Price’s score. Peter Travers/ Rolling StonePeter really liked the movie. He thinks we are a lock for Logan Lerman in supporting and we should be able to get one of the Best Picture slots. He thought the film had excellent below the line chances, as well. He thought Brad Pitt was fantastic, but reminded us, the lead category is just very competitive this year. Peter felt David Ayer did a terrific job at showing the humanity in war. He loved the dinner scene and loved that the German soldier didn’t kill Logan at the end. Peter expected the movie to be much more gratuitous, but was pleased it was not. To him if felt very human, very emotional and very real. He felt you don’t leave the film feeling despondent -- you actually feel like things happened for a reason. He said the film moved at a swift pace and held his interest throughout. Dave Karger/FANDANGODave enjoyed the movie and said that it would be included in his top 15 picks of the year, but not yet in his top 10. He thought it was a B+ film if he were rating it. He thought the performances were powerful, but noted that this is a very strong year for males and it will be tough for actor nominations. Dave said that the film started a little slow for him, but once they got into the apartment with the two women, it took off and he was emotionally invested. He said that the film could have a below-the-line push for the crafts categories. Krista Smith/ Vanity FairKrista really liked the movie. She said she “wanted more of it.” Not more of the violence, but more of the story. She thought that Shia LaBeouf’s performance was fantastic. She did think Brad Pitt was great and really liked the scene in the apartment with the girls. Elvis Mitchell/INTERVIEWElvis thought the scene in the house is an extraordinary sequence. He said that while it seems digressive, it's completely pushing the story forward in emotional and narrative terms and we know who each of those guys are in that house. He thought it is refreshing to see a movie in which tension is subject of a movie in the most subtle way possible, and in which PTSD is illustrated as texture rather than declaimed as a story point.",Private

I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th.

"Brett,1. The Genre, War's (WWII) natural market is older male (senior citizens). Philippine movie market is young. Seniors also get free access to movies. I saw the movie Sunday. Had to bribe the wife to accompany me. Fury was playing in the smallest hall. Less than 20% of the hall was sold and the audience was very old. The movie was quite depressing and heavy. Brad Pitt dying will not sit well with our audience. I anticipate WOM will be poor.2. There was no effort to market the pic to a broader audience. Younger male first person shooter gamers like counter-strike and their girlfriends could be interested in war. An effective online campaign could help broaden the market. Trailering was thin. Our in-theater trailer monitoring the week before its release tells us that Fury share of voice is only 5%, however, the number one pic Nic Sparks' Best of Me was only 3%, but Spark's books and movies based on his books does have more relevance and interest to the bigger young female market.3. Retrictive rating of R16 rating for violence further narrowed the market. Competition had lesser restrictive rating. 4. Booking coverage of the market was also narrow. Booking footprint was only 70 screens. We have over 130 locations. Dracula Untold, on its 2nd week, held over 120 locations.Regards,VictorOn Oct 27, 2014, at 8:34 PM, ""Hogg, Brett"" <Brett_Hogg@spe.sony.com> wrote: Dear Victor,Tough opening of FURY by the local distributor, any thoughts as to why it came in at #4 versus competition?Regards,Brett.From: <Erquiaga>, Andra <Andra.Erquiaga@disney.com>Date: Monday, 27 October, 2014 9:53 pmTo: ""ODell, Steven"" <Steven_ODell@spe.sony.com>, ""Bruer, Rory"" <Rory_Bruer@spe.sony.com>, ""Sands, Jay"" <Jay_Sands@spe.sony.com>, ""Shigemura, Dane"" <Dane_Shigemura@spe.sony.com>, Brett Hogg <Brett_Hogg@spe.sony.com>Cc: Victor Cabrera <Vic.Cabrera@disney.com>, Doris Torres <Doris.Torres@disney.com>, Ronilo Domingo <Ronilo.Domingo@disney.com>, Bernadette Gaffud <Bernadette.Gaffud@disney.com>, ""Oflash, Henry R."" <Henry.R.Oflash@disney.com>Subject: THE EQUALIZER 4TH WEEKEND REPORT - PHILIPPINESDear all, THE EQUALIZER grossed an additional US$ 2,093 / LC 93,858 on 2 screens in 2 locations, for a cume of US$ 1,043,893 / LC 46,818,588.Rental estimate remains at US $ 471,572 / LC 21.15M.

Movie was rated R16 by censors board, only movie-goers age 16 and above are admitted.Rental estimate has now been increased to LC 11.25M from LC4.5M. In spite of the restrictive rating, it is the 4th biggest Sony title opening day for the year, just closely behind 22 Jump Street’s LC 4.5M. In addition, this opening has exceeded theFriday to Sunday gross of a similar title released 2 weeks ago, WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES, with 3-day estimated weekend gross of LC 3.8 million. We note the movie’s strong evening performance, apparently due to stormy afternoon weather and flash flooding around Metro Manila. This helped elevate our receipts, with people opting to wait for flooding to subside and traffic congestion to thin out by watching a movie.

To site a recent example, we recently released Maleficent for Sony Pictures as well as Transformers: Age of Extinction, several weeks before the United States, and no camcording incidents were reported. Furthermore, the Philippines was recently removed from the 2014 Special 301 Watch List, which is a testament to the efforts that we as a community are making in preventing camcording occurrences. SM Supermalls is working closely with the Optical Media Board, the Philippine National Police, the National Cinema Association of the Philippines, and the Motion Picture Anti-Film Piracy Council in a combined effort to prevent camcording occurrences. We have discussed Sony’s concerns internally and SM Supermalls, in conjunction with Pioneer, are prepared to utlizie the following anti-camcording prevention techniques in our theatres to ensure that camcording does not occur: · We will engage Genric Holding Limited, the MPA representative in the Philippines, who will use night vision goggles during screening sessions to prevent any occurrence of illegal camcording in our theatres across metro Manila and the surrounding provinces. Sony should be familiar with Genric as we have used them to prevent camcording on recent Sony films. · We will have 2 guards and 1 usher wearing clearly marked anti-piracy security vests for every theatre in our cinemas screening the movie. · We will inform our cinema employees to be on high alert and reiterate our standard protocol for reporting camcording incidents including notifying the appropriate cinema manager, calling the police, and stopping the movie in session. · We always have 2 civilian guards who roam around our cinemas and take seats beside those individuals suspected of potential camcording. · We will have signs located at all the entrances to the cinemas, outside the ticket booth, and in front of the specific theatres playing the movie with anti-camcording warning messages. · We will have an anti-camcording video being played in every theatre. This video is through the help of our anti-film piracy council. Overall, our annual budget for security measures used to fight camcording has increased by 400%. We have been receiving intel from the MPAA regarding the releases, which helps us to be on high alert. Attached are some of the photos taken at the Mall of Asia. Our branches will accommodate any additional security that Sony or Pioneer would like use to bring in to help ensure that FURY is not camcorded in the Philippines. Thank you, Christiana N.

"That Korea number is crazy high compared to any comps I could think of, whether Brad Pitt or war movie. For FURY, Korea BO estimate at $14.5M is 15% of IBO. Most comps show Korea at 1% or less of IBO (Ing Basterds, Ocean's 11, Mon Men, Capt P, Lincoln). Even the higher grossing films were only 4 - 10%: 10% WWZ, 7% for M/M Smith, and 4% for Ben Button. I know you have to manage to a $100M target, but my vote is definitely to take some of the air out of Korea and maybe put more pressure on Germany/Austria, Netherlands, Belgium and France. Thanks.

A couple of key factors here..as having spoken to him last week about this film I can advise the following. 1. He is going to submit his final estimate after viewing the final version....late September. He is going to get a shorter film...with edits but final rating is important to him. Can he revise /be a little more conservative or is he locked in now ? 2. The tour for Brad Pitt is now confirmed...Nov.12 & 13....but we are in a more competitive November release period....and right now...am checking that he is OK for a Nov.20 release given HUNGER GAMES 3 is on that date...and checking on how strong that franchise is . Maybe Nov. 13 is a possibility ? Speak later when I get more updates from him. Dear Steven Although this is not for the females film and war genre, this is anticipated and decent film to the male audience with high quality in almost every elements including Bred Pitt’s attraction. If we have a Brad Pitt’s junket and remove a few cruel scenes or cuts in order to get 15+ such as -Wardaddy stabs the eye of German soldier who rode white horse with knife. -Torn part of the face splattered when Norman cleans the bloodstain in FURY tank -Head of the American tank operator is blown away by attack of German soldiers my estimates are; Gross box office 15 billion KW/14.6 million USD Rental estimate 6.9 billion KW/6.7 million USD Releasing cost/450 screens 540 million KW/.5 million USD Adpub including junket 2.2 billion KW/2.1 million USD Net contribution 4.16 billion KW/4 million USD I presume the most similar recent comparable title is 300 which hit 18.7 billion KW/18 million USD as their gbo.

S. Korea thinks that by being less stylized and more real and gritty, film has more potential.

Even if Brad has to be in the US during the week leading up to 10/17, as far as I can see there are no impediments to him being in London for that Sunday evening for the closing night of the festival. We appreciate that he may have to depart immediately after the red carpet in order to be back in Malta to commence filming on Monday morning. To reiterate, other than the US, no territory should release prior to 10/19*, and under no circumstances can the film play in another festival prior to 10/19.

Have you been able to speak with production to see of they can build in a hiatus or otherwise minimize the cost if we need Brad the full week of October 13-20. I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity. In that scenario maybe we would try to tack on a few",Private

FURY [FOUR STARS] out of 5 There are some films that don’t just stimulate your eyes and ears. Take Fury, David Ayer’s grim, grimy but utterly gripping movie, set in April 1945 at the fag-end of World War 2. You can feel the mud squelching in your toes. You can taste the blood in your mouth. And, boy, can you smell the stench of rotting corpses, burning flesh and unwashed men. This is a film that puts its boot on the back of your neck, and pushes you face-down into the shit and the scum of wartime conflict. A former member of the US Navy, Ayer has always seasoned his scripts with real-life grit. Corrupt-cop dramas Training Day and Dark Blue and last year’s vérité-style LAPD drama End Of Watch, which he also directed, all boast a lived-it authenticity. Same goes for Fury, a film that captures the ragged, desperate hysteria at the end of WW2 – not to mention the “fanatical resistance” faced by the Allies as the troops push for victory across a broken, war-torn Germany. The vehicle, as it were, for Ayer’s film is a battle-scarred Sherman tank – nicknamed ‘Fury’. In charge of this hulking beast is a US Army Sergeant named ‘Wardaddy’ (Brad Pitt), a veteran who has already fought his way through North Africa. From the moment he knifes a Nazi in the eye, you realize why he’s survived this far; he immediately recalls Robert Duvall’s Lt. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now – the sort who knows he’s not going to get so much as a scratch out there. Forget that Nazi-scalping, Swastika-carving Lt. Aldo Raine Pitt played in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds. With an attitude as severe as his sides-shaved haircut, the star's never been so brutal. Ayer reinforces this from the outset, in a shocking scene where the tank’s rookie recruit Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is given a baptism by fire(arms), when he’s handed a pistol and told by the Sarge to “put a big fat hole” in the back of a captured German, who otherwise would’ve done the same to him. Never having killed before, Norman, a former pencil-pusher who has been thrown into the maelstrom, refuses to bloody his hands, only for Pitt’s character to practically force him to pull the trigger. Such is the sheer gale-force of this it’ll leave you trembling almost as much as Norman (finely acted by Noah star Logan Lerman). But in the words of Wardaddy, “Ideals are peaceful, history is violent” – a phrase that haunts Fury as the blood and guts of war spill out onto the screen. Much of this is left for Norman to witness; it’s his gradual transition from innocence to experience that powers the film, acting as our way into the conflict, and Ayer doesn’t spare him (or us). One sequence sees a soldier set on fire right in front of Norman; rather than burn, the luckless grunt takes a gun and shoots himself in the head – the sort of sight that will scar a man for life. Yet it would be easy for Ayer to simply slather this story with violence and flag-waving patriotism – something he carefully avoids. As much as Wardaddy is a fighter, he’s not a monster. Witness the crucial scene where he shows kindness to two German girls he and Norman encounter (even if Ayer shamefully squeezes in a blatant shirt-off scene for Pitt, as he washes up in time for eggs and tea). Certainly, there’s humanity under the bravado – even as ‘Bible’ (Shia LaBeouf), ‘Gordo’ (Ayer’s End Of Watch star Michael Peña) and Travis (Jon Bernthal), their fellow operators in the tank, show their baser instincts. Really, Fury recalls Wolfgang Petersen’s Das Boot: like that submarine classic, it shows how being in such a confined wartime space can generate both camaraderie /and/ claustrophobia. The film rolls along at a thundering pace, danger hangs in the air like the shrouds of mist that DP Roman Vasyanov beautifully captures. Credit also the work of production designer Andrew Menzies, evocatively recreating wartime Germany in the English countryside (Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire). In a way, there isn’t much more to Fury – stripped of subplots and intrigue, it offers a grunt’s-eye view of the war, with Pitt only occasionally stopping off to talk tactics with Jason Isaacs’ captain. Detractors may claim that, emotionally, Ayer never really brings out the heavy artillery, but there’s enough here for audiences to get thoroughly involved with these spit’n’sawdust characters. Like Norman, Ayer straps us into the front seat and doesn’t let up until the last shell is fired of the final act – a breathless all-guns-blazing sequence that gives Pitt one of the most heroic moments he’s ever played on film. In the end, though, it’s Lerman who leaves the most lasting impression. It’s his film, really, and he grabs his chance with both hands. The result is highly memorable. THE VERDICT Loud, intense, violent, relentless, Fury doesn’t stop until the credits roll, thanks to Ayer’s cracking direction and a committed cast. The best WW2 movie in some time.

FURY [FOUR STARS] out of 5 There are some films that don’t just stimulate your eyes and ears. Take Fury, David Ayer’s grim, grimy but utterly gripping movie, set in April 1945 at the fag-end of World War 2. You can feel the mud squelching in your toes. You can taste the blood in your mouth. And, boy, can you smell the stench of rotting corpses, burning flesh and unwashed men. This is a film that puts its boot on the back of your neck, and pushes you face-down into the shit and the scum of wartime conflict. A former member of the US Navy, Ayer has always seasoned his scripts with real-life grit. Corrupt-cop dramas Training Day and Dark Blue and last year’s vérité-style LAPD drama End Of Watch, which he also directed, all boast a lived-it authenticity. Same goes for Fury, a film that captures the ragged, desperate hysteria at the end of WW2 – not to mention the “fanatical resistance” faced by the Allies as the troops push for victory across a broken, war-torn Germany. The vehicle, as it were, for Ayer’s film is a battle-scarred Sherman tank – nicknamed ‘Fury’. In charge of this hulking beast is a US Army Sergeant named ‘Wardaddy’ (Brad Pitt), a veteran who has already fought his way through North Africa. From the moment he knifes a Nazi in the eye, you realize why he’s survived this far; he immediately recalls Robert Duvall’s Lt. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now – the sort who knows he’s not going to get so much as a scratch out there. Forget that Nazi-scalping, Swastika-carving Lt. Aldo Raine Pitt played in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds. With an attitude as severe as his sides-shaved haircut, the star's never been so brutal. Ayer reinforces this from the outset, in a shocking scene where the tank’s rookie recruit Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is given a baptism by fire(arms), when he’s handed a pistol and told by the Sarge to “put a big fat hole” in the back of a captured German, who otherwise would’ve done the same to him. Never having killed before, Norman, a former pencil-pusher who has been thrown into the maelstrom, refuses to bloody his hands, only for Pitt’s character to practically force him to pull the trigger. Such is the sheer gale-force of this it’ll leave you trembling almost as much as Norman (finely acted by Noah star Logan Lerman). But in the words of Wardaddy, “Ideals are peaceful, history is violent” – a phrase that haunts Fury as the blood and guts of war spill out onto the screen. Much of this is left for Norman to witness; it’s his gradual transition from innocence to experience that powers the film, acting as our way into the conflict, and Ayer doesn’t spare him (or us). One sequence sees a soldier set on fire right in front of Norman; rather than burn, the luckless grunt takes a gun and shoots himself in the head – the sort of sight that will scar a man for life. Yet it would be easy for Ayer to simply slather this story with violence and flag-waving patriotism – something he carefully avoids. As much as Wardaddy is a fighter, he’s not a monster. Witness the crucial scene where he shows kindness to two German girls he and Norman encounter (even if Ayer shamefully squeezes in a blatant shirt-off scene for Pitt, as he washes up in time for eggs and tea). Certainly, there’s humanity under the bravado – even as ‘Bible’ (Shia LaBeouf), ‘Gordo’ (Ayer’s End Of Watch star Michael Peña) and Travis (Jon Bernthal), their fellow operators in the tank, show their baser instincts. Really, Fury recalls Wolfgang Petersen’s Das Boot: like that submarine classic, it shows how being in such a confined wartime space can generate both camaraderie /and/ claustrophobia. The film rolls along at a thundering pace, danger hangs in the air like the shrouds of mist that DP Roman Vasyanov beautifully captures. Credit also the work of production designer Andrew Menzies, evocatively recreating wartime Germany in the English countryside (Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire). In a way, there isn’t much more to Fury – stripped of subplots and intrigue, it offers a grunt’s-eye view of the war, with Pitt only occasionally stopping off to talk tactics with Jason Isaacs’ captain. Detractors may claim that, emotionally, Ayer never really brings out the heavy artillery, but there’s enough here for audiences to get thoroughly involved with these spit’n’sawdust characters. Like Norman, Ayer straps us into the front seat and doesn’t let up until the last shell is fired of the final act – a breathless all-guns-blazing sequence that gives Pitt one of the most heroic moments he’s ever played on film. In the end, though, it’s Lerman who leaves the most lasting impression. It’s his film, really, and he grabs his chance with both hands. The result is highly memorable. THE VERDICT Loud, intense, violent, relentless, Fury doesn’t stop until the credits roll, thanks to Ayer’s cracking direction and a committed cast. The best WW2 movie in some time.

I agree with him. The bottom line is that regardless of the on-going negotiation over Brad’s travel to the US, the LFF closing night is happening on 10/19, and we have that weekend (the 18th and 19th) cleared in his diary. As Brad was not due to be working those two days, I’m assuming there’s no cost involved in closing the set. If we ultimately lose the Monday and forego the Paris premiere, so be it.

Have you been able to speak with production to see of they can build in a hiatus or otherwise minimize the cost if we need Brad the full week of October 13-20. I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity. In that scenario maybe we would try to tack on a few hours of work",Private
"No Sony territories will go ahead of the LFF. Have spoken with QED to make sure they don’t have any of their European markets go out ahead of it either. Have asked them to fight to make sure they don’t let Asia go out before LFF either and they will try to make this happen but in pre-selling the rights (including China) they had basically given an OK to allow markets to go after the US (but no festivals). I believe for LFF this would be a frown but not a deal breaker. Will speak to Bill and Co. at the screening tonight.

(LFF/Bafta/J Ross) Dear AmyIn response to your questions below: LFF Announcement - Press Release TimingsThey are very keen (and under some pressure) to issue the Closing Film announcement as soon as possible. However until we can confirm the wider US/International plan, they cannot announce whether it will be a World or International/European Premiere. The LFF will definitely share the release with us for approval before issuing and we will ask them to start working up a draft in the meantime. Great, thank you! LFF Announcement - MaterialsIdeally the press release would be issued alongside 1 or 2 unseen stills. I’ve asked the photo editor to pull some selects and route for approvals.They will also be keen to have quotes from Brad Pitt and David Ayer if possible. A BP quote could certainly help the release travel. Noted – more likely to get quote from David Ayer and / or filmmakers than Brad, but we will try. UK All Media/Screening strategyWe would like to propose a screening strategy very similar to the plan we implemented for Captain Phillips. Like CP, Fury is an emotionally charged and character-driven piece and we feel best suited to a series of intimate and exclusive previews that culminate in the Premiere screening at the LFF . We are not proposing an all-media but instead a strategic roll out of carefully targeted media screenings, starting as early as we are permitted. Given the stand-out performances of some cast members, early positive word of mouth would really help us in our editorial pitches. We are also looking to nurture wider editorial and promotional partnerships with high profile partners like The Telegraph so they would benefit hugely from seeing the movie early to help maximise their plans. FYI for Captain Phillips, our first screening was August 14 for an October 18 release. Some of our longest lead deadlines are actually in August, so really we would like to start screening selectively in early September under embargo. When would your reviews break? BAFTA Q & AObviously we would love to include BP in a Bafta Q & A and if that’s an option, we could probably schedule this at any point over the weekend. If BP not an option then, yes, we could schedule this Monday night (subject to cinema availability) with David and the rest of the cast. This may also open up opportunities for additional cast to go into radio/TV studios on the Monday morning. Jonathan Ross ShowJust to update you, we had a call with them yesterday to discuss BP and all possible options. They know BP is a long shot and we have asked them to consider every combination (with and without him) including having the full cast on the show together. All theory for now but obviously this would be quite a coup and an amazing mainstream hit for the film. FYI they already have a studio held on Friday 17th October and we have also asked if they could also get a studio on October 18. They are discussing all this with Jonathan and we will pass on feedback from him when we have it.

What other materials do you need for them and what are the deadlines?· UK all media – what is the current date you are targeting? · BAFTA – although there is no official word on an awards campaign, might there be time to accomplish a BAFTA q&a with the cast (likely minus Brad) when they are in town for LFF?

(LFF/Bafta/J Ross) Dear AmyIn response to your questions below: LFF Announcement - Press Release TimingsThey are very keen (and under some pressure) to issue the Closing Film announcement as soon as possible. However until we can confirm the wider US/International plan, they cannot announce whether it will be a World or International/European Premiere. The LFF will definitely share the release with us for approval before issuing and we will ask them to start working up a draft in the meantime. Great, thank you! LFF Announcement - MaterialsIdeally the press release would be issued alongside 1 or 2 unseen stills. I’ve asked the photo editor to pull some selects and route for approvals.They will also be keen to have quotes from Brad Pitt and David Ayer if possible. A BP quote could certainly help the release travel. Noted – more likely to get quote from David Ayer and / or filmmakers than Brad, but we will try. UK All Media/Screening strategyWe would like to propose a screening strategy very similar to the plan we implemented for Captain Phillips. Like CP, Fury is an emotionally charged and character-driven piece and we feel best suited to a series of intimate and exclusive previews that culminate in the Premiere screening at the LFF . We are not proposing an all-media but instead a strategic roll out of carefully targeted media screenings, starting as early as we are permitted. Given the stand-out performances of some cast members, early positive word of mouth would really help us in our editorial pitches. We are also looking to nurture wider editorial and promotional partnerships with high profile partners like The Telegraph so they would benefit hugely from seeing the movie early to help maximise their plans. FYI for Captain Phillips, our first screening was August 14 for an October 18 release. Some of our longest lead deadlines are actually in August, so really we would like to start screening selectively in early September under embargo. When would your reviews break? BAFTA Q & AObviously we would love to include BP in a Bafta Q & A and if that’s an option, we could probably schedule this at any point over the weekend. If BP not an option then, yes, we could schedule this Monday night (subject to cinema availability) with David and the rest of the cast. This may also open up opportunities for additional cast to go into radio/TV studios on the Monday morning. Jonathan Ross ShowJust to update you, we had a call with them yesterday to discuss BP and all possible options. They know BP is a long shot and we have asked them to consider every combination (with and without him) including having the full cast on the show together. All theory for now but obviously this would be quite a coup and an amazing mainstream hit for the film. FYI they already have a studio held on Friday 17th October and we have also asked if they could also get a studio on October 18. They are discussing all this with Jonathan and we will pass on feedback from him when we have it.

What other materials do you need for them and what are the deadlines?· UK all media – what is the current date you are targeting? · BAFTA – although there is no official word on an awards campaign, might there be time to accomplish a BAFTA q&a with the cast (likely minus Brad) when they are in town for LFF?

"Hello steven, We’ve now screened it and though it was more dialogue-driven than we had expected in the first act, we found it to be an authentic portrayal that was well balanced in terms of character development & action. the leader in brad pitt who is scarred and haunted by what he has witnessed was well received by the women members of the team and the depiction of tank battles was certainly a visceral one, as faced at infantry’s level (the fast trajectory of bullets, shells and ricochet) which I haven’t seen in recent years that had a major Hollywood star as the lead. The tone felt BAND OF BROTHERS and ENEMY AT THE GATES like with realistic depictions of battle & hand-to-hand combat feeling very similar to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Though the arc is from the perspective of a rookie who in short time is able to accept the role that he must take, it is a film nonetheless that is carried by Pitt from start to finish. NOV 20 presents the right opportunity as we anticipate screens opening up for that weekend as follows: (SCREEN AVAILABILITY) Week Date Title Dist. Genre opening screen # est. week -2 Nov. 6 THE BOXTROLLS UPI animation 200 1,600 WOLVES Indy horror/action 250 FASHION KING (local) NEW comedy 450 INTERSTELLAR WB SF/adventure 700 week -1 Nov. 13 THE DROP FOX crime/drama 250 1,150 THE CART (local) Indy drama 350 CRIMINAL DESIGNER (local) LOT crime 550 week 0 Nov. 20 MURDER BY CONTRACT (local) Indy crime/thriller 350 1,400 HUNGER GAMES : MOCKINGJAY LOT adventure 450 DAD FOR RENT (local) MEGA comedy/romance 250 FURY SPR war/action 350 week +1 Nov. 27 THE OTHER WOMAN FOX comedy 200 600 GOOD PEOPLE Indy action/crime 150 THE TENOR (local) Indy drama 250 The exhibitors’ anticipation towards INTERSTELLAR is very high yet with a 2 week gap between it and FURY, the natural screen decay by all films from week -2 & -1 will allow for FURY to cross the threshold screen count of 350 to establish itself as an event. And hosting Brad Pitt in mid-november will most certainly help tip the balance. Please bear in mind that the above is only an estimate, but nonetheless a starting point that I rely on for my visualization of strength in holdover screens. (COMPS) Our recent experience with LONE SURVIVOR has taught us that in spite the favourable reaction that it did receive from older males, there was no getting around the perceived American political statement that the film was associated with. A war movie set in WW2 from the POV of allied powers after D-day to eliminate Hitler on german soil will not have any political issues in korea. What will matter most we believe is whether a) the story moves quickly enough from one battle scene to another, b) how empathetic the audience will be of the crew & its leader and c) how valorous they are. I didn’t add SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as comps before 2001 would only paint a distorted picture of a marketplace that was once dictated by the MPAs. I only added DJANGO as a reference as this was chased via a DiCaprio tour. (L-M-H) Adm.

And finally the second trailer by the team was found to be a little easier to identify with the crew’s camaraderie and therefore interpreted as being more heroic as it clearly delivers why the crew must listen to the B Pitt character to hold their ground inside of an immobile ‘Fury’ not only for themselves, but more importantly for a cause greater than themselves. As earlier advised, this is a movie I’d pay to go and see, which also means that the accuracy of historical backdrop is likely to appeal to older males (not saying that there are a lot of us, but it is a defined market nevertheless). Now that we’ve seen the film and with the 20/20 hindsight debate of day & date with the US with less local competition versus nov 20 with increased local competition + the tour, there is no debate here on the current date as the tour would most definitely be needed to push the needle towards being perceived as a brad pitt movie event. We are fully prepared to work with your current publicist as a project manager to maintain continuity and I will ensure that the various agencies & event companies that are already attached to the tour are properly encouraged to power through. Please let me know steven how you would like to proceed. This is a well-made movie. Either way, it’ll require a close watch on cost. Thank you. douglas",Private

To site a recent example, we recently released Maleficent for Sony Pictures as well as Transformers: Age of Extinction, several weeks before the United States, and no camcording incidents were reported. Furthermore, the Philippines was recently removed from the 2014 Special 301 Watch List, which is a testament to the efforts that we as a community are making in preventing camcording occurrences. SM Supermalls is working closely with the Optical Media Board, the Philippine National Police, the National Cinema Association of the Philippines, and the Motion Picture Anti-Film Piracy Council in a combined effort to prevent camcording occurrences. We have discussed Sony’s concerns internally and SM Supermalls, in conjunction with Pioneer, are prepared to utlizie the following anti-camcording prevention techniques in our theatres to ensure that camcording does not occur: · We will engage Genric Holding Limited, the MPA representative in the Philippines, who will use night vision goggles during screening sessions to prevent any occurrence of illegal camcording in our theatres across metro Manila and the surrounding provinces. Sony should be familiar with Genric as we have used them to prevent camcording on recent Sony films. · We will have 2 guards and 1 usher wearing clearly marked anti-piracy security vests for every theatre in our cinemas screening the movie. · We will inform our cinema employees to be on high alert and reiterate our standard protocol for reporting camcording incidents including notifying the appropriate cinema manager, calling the police, and stopping the movie in session. · We always have 2 civilian guards who roam around our cinemas and take seats beside those individuals suspected of potential camcording. · We will have signs located at all the entrances to the cinemas, outside the ticket booth, and in front of the specific theatres playing the movie with anti-camcording warning messages. · We will have an anti-camcording video being played in every theatre. This video is through the help of our anti-film piracy council. Overall, our annual budget for security measures used to fight camcording has increased by 400%. We have been receiving intel from the MPAA regarding the releases, which helps us to be on high alert. Attached are some of the photos taken at the Mall of Asia. Our branches will accommodate any additional security that Sony or Pioneer would like use to bring in to help ensure that FURY is not camcorded in the Philippines. Thank you, Christiana N.

"Memorandum To: DistributionFrom: Ileen Reich and Angela GalganiDate: September 24, 2014 RE: Fury / Screening Reactions #2Below, please find screening reactions on behalf of Fury. We will continue to update this document as reactions come in. New reactions in bold. Kathy Heintzelman / FREELANCEKathy said she would count herself as a David Ayer fan – she really liked End of Watch. She thought Fury was well done, overall but it wasn't her favorite film this year. She would give the film a B. She said got very mixed messages from it -- and maybe that's realistic and commendable, but it felt a little manipulative to her. For example, a lot of it sends the ""war is hell"" message, but by the final standoff, with the swelling music, it seemed like this was the greatest job and the greatest camaraderie these guys were ever going to have (they even say as much). “Maybe that's the way battle really is, I don't know; or maybe that's the way it felt to the Greatest Generation in a war where there was a much clearer sense of good and evil.” But she thought it undercut the moral dilemmas the young newbie was wrestling with in the first half of the film. To her there were two standout sequences -- the one where the two tanks are battling each other, and the one in the house in the German town with the two women. In the tank sequence, she was really engaged with the mechanics of the battle in ways she wasn't during the final sequence. And the German town scene was just... weird in an interesting way. She couldn't quite buy that the other guys from the tank would be that harassing when their chief was clearly upset by their behavior. Or why he didn't just tell them to knock it off. Kathy didn't understand the dynamics there, but it was interesting and a nice break from battle scenes. The way the gunshots were indicated with colored laser-like bursts distracted her-- she felt it seemed cartoonish or video-game-ish. Kathy did mention for all she knows that's the way it really looks on the battlefield, but again, it sent a kind of mixed message. Kathy liked the acting although thought the characters were sort of stock. What happened with the newbie seemed obvious from the beginning -- if he didn't die early on he'd end up the way he did. And, it was hard to forget that that was Brad Pitt -- no fault of his acting, but he was a figurehead or symbol more than an actual character. She wouldn't have minded learning a little more about him and some of the others, but, that's a staple of old WWII movies that Ayer avoided. Although she would have liked just a little more.Pete Hammond/Deadline HollywoodPete said he could not believe how good the film was. He mentioned he is a big David Ayer fan. He thought all the performances were great, especially Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman. “Do not count out Brad Pitt this year . “ He said the film is definitely in the Best Picture race -- especially a push for all of the crafts and not to forget that the Academy loves a war movie. Roger Durling/Executive Director Santa Barbara Film FestivalRoger was visibly moved and completely shaken after the screening, and on the spot invited the film to screen at the Festival’s Cinema Society. He said the film had so much humanity and there was never a false note. He loved the authenticity and texture of the film and was very inquisitive about how it was shot. He was a fan of both Logan Lerman and Brad Pitt’s performances and noted it was career shifting role for Shia (in light of his recent press). He was incredibly enthusiastic in his reaction. Timothy Blake/President of SAG Film SocietyShe said it was an incredible ensemble performance. It was all about the work-it was all up there on the screen. Everyone one of the actors gave an amazing performance. She feels that Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman were standouts and gave Award caliber performances. Going in she felt this would skew more male, but after seeing it, and they way she personally felt, she feels women will respond to it as well. She thinks the film has a good chance to be nominated for SAG ensemble. Tim Gray/VarietyHe thinks this is a new level of achievement for Brad Pitt. He is a big supporter of the film. Especially noted the Cinematography and Steven Price’s score. Peter Travers/ Rolling StonePeter really liked the movie. He thinks we are a lock for Logan Lerman in supporting and we should be able to get one of the Best Picture slots. He thought the film had excellent below the line chances, as well. He thought Brad Pitt was fantastic, but reminded us, the lead category is just very competitive this year. Peter felt David Ayer did a terrific job at showing the humanity in war. He loved the dinner scene and loved that the German soldier didn’t kill Logan at the end. Peter expected the movie to be much more gratuitous, but was pleased it was not. To him if felt very human, very emotional and very real. He felt you don’t leave the film feeling despondent -- you actually feel like things happened for a reason. He said the film moved at a swift pace and held his interest throughout. Dave Karger/FANDANGODave enjoyed the movie and said that it would be included in his top 15 picks of the year, but not yet in his top 10. He thought it was a B+ film if he were rating it. He thought the performances were powerful, but noted that this is a very strong year for males and it will be tough for actor nominations. Dave said that the film started a little slow for him, but once they got into the apartment with the two women, it took off and he was emotionally invested. He said that the film could have a below-the-line push for the crafts categories. Krista Smith/ Vanity FairKrista really liked the movie. She said she “wanted more of it.” Not more of the violence, but more of the story. She thought that Shia LaBeouf’s performance was fantastic. She did think Brad Pitt was great and really liked the scene in the apartment with the girls. Elvis Mitchell/INTERVIEWElvis thought the scene in the house is an extraordinary sequence. He said that while it seems digressive, it's completely pushing the story forward in emotional and narrative terms and we know who each of those guys are in that house. He thought it is refreshing to see a movie in which tension is subject of a movie in the most subtle way possible, and in which PTSD is illustrated as texture rather than declaimed as a story point.",Private
"Great!

THE SUN / Grant Rollings – POSITIVEI loved Fury. Better than Saving Private Ryan in my opinion. BBC RADIO 1 / Andy Taylor – POSITIVEI thought it was very good. Strong performances from Brad, Shia and Logan. Gruesomely real, very intense and gripping to watch. GLOBAL RADIO / Charlie Girling – POSITIVEI thought it was brilliant – absolutely gripping and Brad was amazing. BBC WORLD SERVICE RADIO – ARTS / Vincent Dowd – POSITIVE / MIXEDI didn’t know much about the film in advance, other than having seen the trailer. Though the movie’s a bit formulaic and holds few surprises, I nonetheless enjoyed it. The central cast are all strong and Logan Lerman (who I’ve never seen before) made his role believable… although his character arc is obvious from the moment he appears on screen. It’s very well made and gives, I would guess, a pretty accurate feel for how hellish being in a tank in the middle of battle must be like. The shoot-out in the last half-hour is pretty ridiculous if you think about it but has enough visceral power that you just go with it. It’ll be a hit, partly because of Brad Pitt’s presence but also because there have been few really strong WW2 movies for a while. EMPIRE ONLINE / Phil de Semlyen – POSITIVEIt was a properly bleak, post-Private Ryan war movie. Glad Ayer didn't go with the handheld approach because it might have been overwhelming: the violence and savagery of war has never been so terrifying. Some of the set pieces worked better than others - the tank duel was nerve-shredding - but it felt very committed to getting the subject right, and I really liked that about it. FREELANCE / TOTAL FILM / Jamie Graham – POSITIVEVery strong. Couple of niggles aside (felt the score was a tad overused & the climax veered towards Schwarzenegger territory, though with a human cost) it was exceptional. The terrible violence was treated in such a matter-of-fact manner that it really hit home, and the soiled palette of the film (dirt and desperation) gave a muddy reality to the war-is-hell inferno they trundle through. The performances were all top drawer. The dinner scene that forms the centrepiece of the movie was quite brilliant - reminded me of a couple of the best scenes in Inglorious Basterds but without QT's arch dialogue, meaning it was far more powerful & affecting. Likewise, the themes were adult & complex, with heroics shrouded in ambiguity. No simplistic flag-waving here. Sure it will be in the mix come awards season, and deservedly so. DAILY TELEGRAPH / Alice Vincent – POSITIVEAlthough I found it unrelentingly grim, it was a good, gripping, harrowing watch which has stuck with me. RADIO TIMES / Stella Papamichael - POSITIVEI thought the film had huge visceral impact, great performances inc. Logan Lerman. A bit 'Hollywood' in parts, but this will be getting a solid 4 stars for Radio Times. THE LIST / Emma Simmonds – POSITIVEI thought the film was great, appropriately brutal, moving and exciting.

TOTAL FILM / Richard Jordan – POSITIVEThanks for having me along to the screening last night. I thought the film was great – super-intense and authentic, it was kind of an assault on the senses (in a good way), the story and script were tight and the performances were fantastic across the board. In my opinion it's the best film David Ayer has made yet and I reckon it's going to be up there with some of the best war movies. DAZED & CONFUSED / DAZED DIGITAL / Trey Taylor – POSITIVEI absolutely loved it - Logan is an undisputed star! THE GUARDIAN / Catherine Shoard – POSITIVEI thought it was really interesting! Loads of fodder for stories, v gripping and well played (Pitt esp) tho sometimes seemed to slip slightly into cliche. Four stars I reckon. THE GUARDIAN / Henry Barnes – POSITIVE / MIXEDI liked it. Pitt was great. The atmosphere was believably miserable and I am glad it wasn't sanitised. Lerman did a decent job with a slight part. On the other hand: the depiction of the Germans was over-worked to the point of being insulting, the supporting characters were too broad, the ending strayed from the gritty realism we'd been given up to that point. Edging on a 4 star. SHORTLIST / Andrew Dickens – POSITIVEI was going to say I really enjoyed it, but that's definitely the wrong verb. I thought it was very good. Ambitious, honest and as brutal, intense portrayal of WW2 as I have ever seen. There were a couple of cheesy moments and I'd question the pace and distance of Norman's descent into lusting killer, but maybe that happened. Also, I was slightly disappointed that, having been shot four times (which didn't seem to affect him much), then inside a tank with two exploding grenades, then left dead for several hours, Brad Pitt looked like he was having a nap, with perfect hair and a slight skin rash. Considering the gore levels elsewhere, I think it was a bit of a cop out and more realism would've served to make a more impactful final scene. That aside, great performances all round, particular Shia L and Jon B, in what really felt like an old-fashioned war film with 21st century levels of realism. GOOD MORNING BRITAIN (ITV1) / Nick Rylance - POSITIVEIt's incredible I loved it. Tense, gripping, moving, jumpy, compelling to watch. Terrific performances.Probably the best war film I've seen in many years - opens up a whole area I knew nothing about, and a story well worth telling. Edge of my seat. A great cinematic experience. HEAT / THE GUARDIAN / Charles Gant – POSITIVEI liked it, strong performances, nicely delineated characters and effectively plunges you into the battle, ie very evocatively filmed. Scene with the two women was a nice counterpoint.I've always thought Logan Lerman was an underrated actor, so nice to see him being entrusted with this role.The depiction of the final heroic act (one Sherman tank v an entire SS battalion) seems so specific, you want it to be based on something that actually happened in reality, otherwise you feel like it's a Boy's Own fantasy, and I'm not sure what exactly the film is saying.The overall setting -- the SS forcing women and children to fight in the dying weeks of the war or face being strung up as a coward -- does give it a firm anchor. FREELANCE / THE INDEPENDENT / METRO – James Mottram – POSITIVEI have to say, I thought it was pretty amazing. Brutal, gritty, terrifying - quite a watch really. One of Brad's best. Even Shia wasn't annoying! And Logan L. was excellent...it's his film really. FREELANCE / SUNDAY TIMES CULTURE – Ryan Gilbey – MIXEDI wasn't nuts about it. It was spectacularly shot, especially the final battle. The cinematography was really rich and vivid. But I think there was a personality crisis in the film between two types of filmmaking. I couldn;t understand why David Ayer went to all that considerable trouble to make it authentic and explicit - from the horrible first scene to various icky details like the bodies being flattened by tanks - only to then smother the movie in the most awful corny syrupy score, which basically undermined the gritty effect. It's like it wanted to be both Come & See AND The Dirty Dozen (Saving Private Ryan had the same problem but not as bad). And it was a bit of a Nazi-killing wet-dream videogame. The only German soldier who came close to being an actual character was the conveniently nice one who spares Norman. Inglourious Basterds may have been a fantasy but even that showed that there were brave Germans too. Anyway, that's my take. LITTLE WHITE LIES / Adam Woodward – MIXEDI must say I thought the action sequences were incredible, some of the best I've seen since Band of Brothers. But story wise I felt it laid it on a little thick. METRO / ELLE / FREELANCE / Anna Smith – POSITIVE/MIXEDI thought it was a very interesting film, powerful and a brave perspective on the inhumanity of war and its affect on men. Visually very strong. Good performances.I had an issue with the scene with the women, however. It felt as if potentially non consensual sex was being presented in a positive and even humorous light.Aside from that, great FREELANCE / Joe Utichi – POSITIVEI absolutely loved it. Pitt and especially Lerman were terrific and the film did what I haven’t seen a WW2 picture do since Saving Private Ryan: give me a new perspective on that conflict. It wasn’t so dour as to be inaccessible either, but boy did it not shirk in being honest about the horror. Brilliantly executed and so gripping. I am desperate to see it again!!! DAILY TELEGRAPH / Ross Jones - POSITIVEsorry for delayed reaction – I’m still recovering. It was possibly the most intense WW2 film I’ve seen, which I mean as a compliment. Logan is incredible, as you all said he was, and all the grime and dirt just oozed off the screen. And I still have a knot in my stomach thinking about the battle with the Tiger. And last 20 minutes. And even the dinner table scene, for that matter, so, an awesome achievement really.",Private

"Below is an advance copy of the review that is set to run POST EMBARGO in the UK publication TOTAL FILM. FURY[FOUR STARS] out of 5There are some films that don’t just stimulate your eyes and ears. Take Fury, David Ayer’s grim, grimy but utterly gripping movie, set in April 1945 at the fag-end of World War 2. You can feel the mud squelching in your toes. You can taste the blood in your mouth. And, boy, can you smell the stench of rotting corpses, burning flesh and unwashed men. This is a film that puts its boot on the back of your neck, and pushes you face-down into the shit and the scum of wartime conflict. A former member of the US Navy, Ayer has always seasoned his scripts with real-life grit. Corrupt-cop dramas Training Day and Dark Blue and last year’s vérité-style LAPD drama End Of Watch, which he also directed, all boast a lived-it authenticity. Same goes for Fury, a film that captures the ragged, desperate hysteria at the end of WW2 – not to mention the “fanatical resistance” faced by the Allies as the troops push for victory across a broken, war-torn Germany. The vehicle, as it were, for Ayer’s film is a battle-scarred Sherman tank – nicknamed ‘Fury’. In charge of this hulking beast is a US Army Sergeant named ‘Wardaddy’ (Brad Pitt), a veteran who has already fought his way through North Africa. From the moment he knifes a Nazi in the eye, you realize why he’s survived this far; he immediately recalls Robert Duvall’s Lt. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now – the sort who knows he’s not going to get so much as a scratch out there. Forget that Nazi-scalping, Swastika-carving Lt. Aldo Raine Pitt played in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds. With an attitude as severe as his sides-shaved haircut, the star's never been so brutal. Ayer reinforces this from the outset, in a shocking scene where the tank’s rookie recruit Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is given a baptism by fire(arms), when he’s handed a pistol and told by the Sarge to “put a big fat hole” in the back of a captured German, who otherwise would’ve done the same to him. Never having killed before, Norman, a former pencil-pusher who has been thrown into the maelstrom, refuses to bloody his hands, only for Pitt’s character to practically force him to pull the trigger. Such is the sheer gale-force of this it’ll leave you trembling almost as much as Norman (finely acted by Noah star Logan Lerman). But in the words of Wardaddy, “Ideals are peaceful, history is violent” – a phrase that haunts Fury as the blood and guts of war spill out onto the screen. Much of this is left for Norman to witness; it’s his gradual transition from innocence to experience that powers the film, acting as our way into the conflict, and Ayer doesn’t spare him (or us). One sequence sees a soldier set on fire right in front of Norman; rather than burn, the luckless grunt takes a gun and shoots himself in the head – the sort of sight that will scar a man for life. Yet it would be easy for Ayer to simply slather this story with violence and flag-waving patriotism – something he carefully avoids.As much as Wardaddy is a fighter, he’s not a monster. Witness the crucial scene where he shows kindness to two German girls he and Norman encounter (even if Ayer shamefully squeezes in a blatant shirt-off scene for Pitt, as he washes up in time for eggs and tea). Certainly, there’s humanity under the bravado – even as ‘Bible’ (Shia LaBeouf), ‘Gordo’ (Ayer’s End Of Watch star Michael Peña) and Travis (Jon Bernthal), their fellow operators in the tank, show their baser instincts. Really, Fury recalls Wolfgang Petersen’s Das Boot: like that submarine classic, it shows how being in such a confined wartime space can generate both camaraderie /and/ claustrophobia. The film rolls along at a thundering pace, danger hangs in the air like the shrouds of mist that DP Roman Vasyanov beautifully captures. Credit also the work of production designer Andrew Menzies, evocatively recreating wartime Germany in the English countryside (Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire).In a way, there isn’t much more to Fury – stripped of subplots and intrigue, it offers a grunt’s-eye view of the war, with Pitt only occasionally stopping off to talk tactics with Jason Isaacs’ captain. Detractors may claim that, emotionally, Ayer never really brings out the heavy artillery, but there’s enough here for audiences to get thoroughly involved with these spit’n’sawdust characters. Like Norman, Ayer straps us into the front seat and doesn’t let up until the last shell is fired of the final act – a breathless all-guns-blazing sequence that gives Pitt one of the most heroic moments he’s ever played on film. In the end, though, it’s Lerman who leaves the most lasting impression. It’s his film, really, and he grabs his chance with both hands. The result is highly memorable. THE VERDICT Loud, intense, violent, relentless, Fury doesn’t stop until the credits roll, thanks to Ayer’s cracking direction and a committed cast. The best WW2 movie in some time.",Private

"Below please find the reactions from our 2nd press screening of FURY in London. THE SUN / Grant Rollings – POSITIVEI loved Fury. Better than Saving Private Ryan in my opinion. BBC RADIO 1 / Andy Taylor – POSITIVEI thought it was very good. Strong performances from Brad, Shia and Logan. Gruesomely real, very intense and gripping to watch. GLOBAL RADIO / Charlie Girling – POSITIVEI thought it was brilliant – absolutely gripping and Brad was amazing. BBC WORLD SERVICE RADIO – ARTS / Vincent Dowd – POSITIVE / MIXEDI didn’t know much about the film in advance, other than having seen the trailer. Though the movie’s a bit formulaic and holds few surprises, I nonetheless enjoyed it. The central cast are all strong and Logan Lerman (who I’ve never seen before) made his role believable… although his character arc is obvious from the moment he appears on screen. It’s very well made and gives, I would guess, a pretty accurate feel for how hellish being in a tank in the middle of battle must be like. The shoot-out in the last half-hour is pretty ridiculous if you think about it but has enough visceral power that you just go with it. It’ll be a hit, partly because of Brad Pitt’s presence but also because there have been few really strong WW2 movies for a while. EMPIRE ONLINE / Phil de Semlyen – POSITIVEIt was a properly bleak, post-Private Ryan war movie. Glad Ayer didn't go with the handheld approach because it might have been overwhelming: the violence and savagery of war has never been so terrifying. Some of the set pieces worked better than others - the tank duel was nerve-shredding - but it felt very committed to getting the subject right, and I really liked that about it. FREELANCE / TOTAL FILM / Jamie Graham – POSITIVEVery strong. Couple of niggles aside (felt the score was a tad overused & the climax veered towards Schwarzenegger territory, though with a human cost) it was exceptional. The terrible violence was treated in such a matter-of-fact manner that it really hit home, and the soiled palette of the film (dirt and desperation) gave a muddy reality to the war-is-hell inferno they trundle through. The performances were all top drawer. The dinner scene that forms the centrepiece of the movie was quite brilliant - reminded me of a couple of the best scenes in Inglorious Basterds but without QT's arch dialogue, meaning it was far more powerful & affecting. Likewise, the themes were adult & complex, with heroics shrouded in ambiguity. No simplistic flag-waving here. Sure it will be in the mix come awards season, and deservedly so. DAILY TELEGRAPH / Alice Vincent – POSITIVEAlthough I found it unrelentingly grim, it was a good, gripping, harrowing watch which has stuck with me. RADIO TIMES / Stella Papamichael - POSITIVEI thought the film had huge visceral impact, great performances inc. Logan Lerman. A bit 'Hollywood' in parts, but this will be getting a solid 4 stars for Radio Times. THE LIST / Emma Simmonds – POSITIVEI thought the film was great, appropriately brutal, moving and exciting.

TOTAL FILM / Richard Jordan – POSITIVEThanks for having me along to the screening last night. I thought the film was great – super-intense and authentic, it was kind of an assault on the senses (in a good way), the story and script were tight and the performances were fantastic across the board. In my opinion it's the best film David Ayer has made yet and I reckon it's going to be up there with some of the best war movies. DAZED & CONFUSED / DAZED DIGITAL / Trey Taylor – POSITIVEI absolutely loved it - Logan is an undisputed star! THE GUARDIAN / Catherine Shoard – POSITIVEI thought it was really interesting! Loads of fodder for stories, v gripping and well played (Pitt esp) tho sometimes seemed to slip slightly into cliche. Four stars I reckon. THE GUARDIAN / Henry Barnes – POSITIVE / MIXEDI liked it. Pitt was great. The atmosphere was believably miserable and I am glad it wasn't sanitised. Lerman did a decent job with a slight part. On the other hand: the depiction of the Germans was over-worked to the point of being insulting, the supporting characters were too broad, the ending strayed from the gritty realism we'd been given up to that point. Edging on a 4 star. SHORTLIST / Andrew Dickens – POSITIVEI was going to say I really enjoyed it, but that's definitely the wrong verb. I thought it was very good. Ambitious, honest and as brutal, intense portrayal of WW2 as I have ever seen. There were a couple of cheesy moments and I'd question the pace and distance of Norman's descent into lusting killer, but maybe that happened. Also, I was slightly disappointed that, having been shot four times (which didn't seem to affect him much), then inside a tank with two exploding grenades, then left dead for several hours, Brad Pitt looked like he was having a nap, with perfect hair and a slight skin rash. Considering the gore levels elsewhere, I think it was a bit of a cop out and more realism would've served to make a more impactful final scene. That aside, great performances all round, particular Shia L and Jon B, in what really felt like an old-fashioned war film with 21st century levels of realism. GOOD MORNING BRITAIN (ITV1) / Nick Rylance - POSITIVEIt's incredible I loved it. Tense, gripping, moving, jumpy, compelling to watch. Terrific performances.Probably the best war film I've seen in many years - opens up a whole area I knew nothing about, and a story well worth telling. Edge of my seat. A great cinematic experience. HEAT / THE GUARDIAN / Charles Gant – POSITIVEI liked it, strong performances, nicely delineated characters and effectively plunges you into the battle, ie very evocatively filmed. Scene with the two women was a nice counterpoint.I've always thought Logan Lerman was an underrated actor, so nice to see him being entrusted with this role.The depiction of the final heroic act (one Sherman tank v an entire SS battalion) seems so specific, you want it to be based on something that actually happened in reality, otherwise you feel like it's a Boy's Own fantasy, and I'm not sure what exactly the film is saying.The overall setting -- the SS forcing women and children to fight in the dying weeks of the war or face being strung up as a coward -- does give it a firm anchor. FREELANCE / THE INDEPENDENT / METRO – James Mottram – POSITIVEI have to say, I thought it was pretty amazing. Brutal, gritty, terrifying - quite a watch really. One of Brad's best. Even Shia wasn't annoying! And Logan L. was excellent...it's his film really. FREELANCE / SUNDAY TIMES CULTURE – Ryan Gilbey – MIXEDI wasn't nuts about it. It was spectacularly shot, especially the final battle. The cinematography was really rich and vivid. But I think there was a personality crisis in the film between two types of filmmaking. I couldn;t understand why David Ayer went to all that considerable trouble to make it authentic and explicit - from the horrible first scene to various icky details like the bodies being flattened by tanks - only to then smother the movie in the most awful corny syrupy score, which basically undermined the gritty effect. It's like it wanted to be both Come & See AND The Dirty Dozen (Saving Private Ryan had the same problem but not as bad). And it was a bit of a Nazi-killing wet-dream videogame. The only German soldier who came close to being an actual character was the conveniently nice one who spares Norman. Inglourious Basterds may have been a fantasy but even that showed that there were brave Germans too. Anyway, that's my take. LITTLE WHITE LIES / Adam Woodward – MIXEDI must say I thought the action sequences were incredible, some of the best I've seen since Band of Brothers. But story wise I felt it laid it on a little thick. METRO / ELLE / FREELANCE / Anna Smith – POSITIVE/MIXEDI thought it was a very interesting film, powerful and a brave perspective on the inhumanity of war and its affect on men. Visually very strong. Good performances.I had an issue with the scene with the women, however. It felt as if potentially non consensual sex was being presented in a positive and even humorous light.Aside from that, great FREELANCE / Joe Utichi – POSITIVEI absolutely loved it. Pitt and especially Lerman were terrific and the film did what I haven’t seen a WW2 picture do since Saving Private Ryan: give me a new perspective on that conflict. It wasn’t so dour as to be inaccessible either, but boy did it not shirk in being honest about the horror. Brilliantly executed and so gripping. I am desperate to see it again!!! DAILY TELEGRAPH / Ross Jones - POSITIVEsorry for delayed reaction – I’m still recovering. It was possibly the most intense WW2 film I’ve seen, which I mean as a compliment. Logan is incredible, as you all said he was, and all the grime and dirt just oozed off the screen. And I still have a knot in my stomach thinking about the battle with the Tiger. And last 20 minutes. And even the dinner table scene, for that matter, so, an awesome achievement really.",Private

I agree with him. The bottom line is that regardless of the on-going negotiation over Brad’s travel to the US, the LFF closing night is happening on 10/19, and we have that weekend (the 18th and 19th) cleared in his diary.

It would have to be Brad working Monday the 13th, flown out private Monday when he wraps, and between international and domestic, they have him through Sunday night for the London film festival. Having to leave after the movie starts Sunday night private to be back at work in Malta on Monday. That's what I got so far. Give me feedback. And he'll be there for the Bovington weekend.

Have you been able to speak with production to see of they can build in a hiatus or otherwise minimize the cost if we need Brad the full week of October 13-20. I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity. In that scenario maybe we would try to tack on a few hours of work at the end of August when he's at",Private

FURY[FOUR STARS] out of 5There are some films that don’t just stimulate your eyes and ears. Take Fury, David Ayer’s grim, grimy but utterly gripping movie, set in April 1945 at the fag-end of World War 2. You can feel the mud squelching in your toes. You can taste the blood in your mouth. And, boy, can you smell the stench of rotting corpses, burning flesh and unwashed men. This is a film that puts its boot on the back of your neck, and pushes you face-down into the shit and the scum of wartime conflict. A former member of the US Navy, Ayer has always seasoned his scripts with real-life grit. Corrupt-cop dramas Training Day and Dark Blue and last year’s vérité-style LAPD drama End Of Watch, which he also directed, all boast a lived-it authenticity. Same goes for Fury, a film that captures the ragged, desperate hysteria at the end of WW2 – not to mention the “fanatical resistance” faced by the Allies as the troops push for victory across a broken, war-torn Germany. The vehicle, as it were, for Ayer’s film is a battle-scarred Sherman tank – nicknamed ‘Fury’. In charge of this hulking beast is a US Army Sergeant named ‘Wardaddy’ (Brad Pitt), a veteran who has already fought his way through North Africa. From the moment he knifes a Nazi in the eye, you realize why he’s survived this far; he immediately recalls Robert Duvall’s Lt. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now – the sort who knows he’s not going to get so much as a scratch out there. Forget that Nazi-scalping, Swastika-carving Lt. Aldo Raine Pitt played in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds. With an attitude as severe as his sides-shaved haircut, the star's never been so brutal. Ayer reinforces this from the outset, in a shocking scene where the tank’s rookie recruit Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is given a baptism by fire(arms), when he’s handed a pistol and told by the Sarge to “put a big fat hole” in the back of a captured German, who otherwise would’ve done the same to him. Never having killed before, Norman, a former pencil-pusher who has been thrown into the maelstrom, refuses to bloody his hands, only for Pitt’s character to practically force him to pull the trigger. Such is the sheer gale-force of this it’ll leave you trembling almost as much as Norman (finely acted by Noah star Logan Lerman). But in the words of Wardaddy, “Ideals are peaceful, history is violent” – a phrase that haunts Fury as the blood and guts of war spill out onto the screen. Much of this is left for Norman to witness; it’s his gradual transition from innocence to experience that powers the film, acting as our way into the conflict, and Ayer doesn’t spare him (or us). One sequence sees a soldier set on fire right in front of Norman; rather than burn, the luckless grunt takes a gun and shoots himself in the head – the sort of sight that will scar a man for life. Yet it would be easy for Ayer to simply slather this story with violence and flag-waving patriotism – something he carefully avoids.As much as Wardaddy is a fighter, he’s not a monster. Witness the crucial scene where he shows kindness to two German girls he and Norman encounter (even if Ayer shamefully squeezes in a blatant shirt-off scene for Pitt, as he washes up in time for eggs and tea). Certainly, there’s humanity under the bravado – even as ‘Bible’ (Shia LaBeouf), ‘Gordo’ (Ayer’s End Of Watch star Michael Peña) and Travis (Jon Bernthal), their fellow operators in the tank, show their baser instincts. Really, Fury recalls Wolfgang Petersen’s Das Boot: like that submarine classic, it shows how being in such a confined wartime space can generate both camaraderie /and/ claustrophobia. The film rolls along at a thundering pace, danger hangs in the air like the shrouds of mist that DP Roman Vasyanov beautifully captures. Credit also the work of production designer Andrew Menzies, evocatively recreating wartime Germany in the English countryside (Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire).In a way, there isn’t much more to Fury – stripped of subplots and intrigue, it offers a grunt’s-eye view of the war, with Pitt only occasionally stopping off to talk tactics with Jason Isaacs’ captain. Detractors may claim that, emotionally, Ayer never really brings out the heavy artillery, but there’s enough here for audiences to get thoroughly involved with these spit’n’sawdust characters. Like Norman, Ayer straps us into the front seat and doesn’t let up until the last shell is fired of the final act – a breathless all-guns-blazing sequence that gives Pitt one of the most heroic moments he’s ever played on film. In the end, though, it’s Lerman who leaves the most lasting impression. It’s his film, really, and he grabs his chance with both hands. The result is highly memorable. THE VERDICT Loud, intense, violent, relentless, Fury doesn’t stop until the credits roll, thanks to Ayer’s cracking direction and a committed cast. The best WW2 movie in some time.",Private

"Well helloHow bout thatSent from my Sony Xperia Z2On Oct 8, 2014, at 11:00 AM, ""Tesser-Marquez, Amy"" <Amy_Tesser-Marquez@spe.sony.com> wrote: Below is an advance copy of the review that is set to run POST EMBARGO in the UK publication TOTAL FILM. FURY[FOUR STARS] out of 5There are some films that don’t just stimulate your eyes and ears. Take Fury, David Ayer’s grim, grimy but utterly gripping movie, set in April 1945 at the fag-end of World War 2. You can feel the mud squelching in your toes. You can taste the blood in your mouth. And, boy, can you smell the stench of rotting corpses, burning flesh and unwashed men. This is a film that puts its boot on the back of your neck, and pushes you face-down into the shit and the scum of wartime conflict. A former member of the US Navy, Ayer has always seasoned his scripts with real-life grit. Corrupt-cop dramas Training Day and Dark Blue and last year’s vérité-style LAPD drama End Of Watch, which he also directed, all boast a lived-it authenticity. Same goes for Fury, a film that captures the ragged, desperate hysteria at the end of WW2 – not to mention the “fanatical resistance” faced by the Allies as the troops push for victory across a broken, war-torn Germany. The vehicle, as it were, for Ayer’s film is a battle-scarred Sherman tank – nicknamed ‘Fury’. In charge of this hulking beast is a US Army Sergeant named ‘Wardaddy’ (Brad Pitt), a veteran who has already fought his way through North Africa. From the moment he knifes a Nazi in the eye, you realize why he’s survived this far; he immediately recalls Robert Duvall’s Lt. Kilgore in Apocalypse Now – the sort who knows he’s not going to get so much as a scratch out there. Forget that Nazi-scalping, Swastika-carving Lt. Aldo Raine Pitt played in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglorious Basterds. With an attitude as severe as his sides-shaved haircut, the star's never been so brutal. Ayer reinforces this from the outset, in a shocking scene where the tank’s rookie recruit Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) is given a baptism by fire(arms), when he’s handed a pistol and told by the Sarge to “put a big fat hole” in the back of a captured German, who otherwise would’ve done the same to him. Never having killed before, Norman, a former pencil-pusher who has been thrown into the maelstrom, refuses to bloody his hands, only for Pitt’s character to practically force him to pull the trigger. Such is the sheer gale-force of this it’ll leave you trembling almost as much as Norman (finely acted by Noah star Logan Lerman). But in the words of Wardaddy, “Ideals are peaceful, history is violent” – a phrase that haunts Fury as the blood and guts of war spill out onto the screen. Much of this is left for Norman to witness; it’s his gradual transition from innocence to experience that powers the film, acting as our way into the conflict, and Ayer doesn’t spare him (or us). One sequence sees a soldier set on fire right in front of Norman; rather than burn, the luckless grunt takes a gun and shoots himself in the head – the sort of sight that will scar a man for life. Yet it would be easy for Ayer to simply slather this story with violence and flag-waving patriotism – something he carefully avoids.As much as Wardaddy is a fighter, he’s not a monster. Witness the crucial scene where he shows kindness to two German girls he and Norman encounter (even if Ayer shamefully squeezes in a blatant shirt-off scene for Pitt, as he washes up in time for eggs and tea). Certainly, there’s humanity under the bravado – even as ‘Bible’ (Shia LaBeouf), ‘Gordo’ (Ayer’s End Of Watch star Michael Peña) and Travis (Jon Bernthal), their fellow operators in the tank, show their baser instincts. Really, Fury recalls Wolfgang Petersen’s Das Boot: like that submarine classic, it shows how being in such a confined wartime space can generate both camaraderie /and/ claustrophobia. The film rolls along at a thundering pace, danger hangs in the air like the shrouds of mist that DP Roman Vasyanov beautifully captures. Credit also the work of production designer Andrew Menzies, evocatively recreating wartime Germany in the English countryside (Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire).In a way, there isn’t much more to Fury – stripped of subplots and intrigue, it offers a grunt’s-eye view of the war, with Pitt only occasionally stopping off to talk tactics with Jason Isaacs’ captain. Detractors may claim that, emotionally, Ayer never really brings out the heavy artillery, but there’s enough here for audiences to get thoroughly involved with these spit’n’sawdust characters. Like Norman, Ayer straps us into the front seat and doesn’t let up until the last shell is fired of the final act – a breathless all-guns-blazing sequence that gives Pitt one of the most heroic moments he’s ever played on film. In the end, though, it’s Lerman who leaves the most lasting impression. It’s his film, really, and he grabs his chance with both hands. The result is highly memorable. THE VERDICT Loud, intense, violent, relentless, Fury doesn’t stop until the credits roll, thanks to Ayer’s cracking direction and a committed cast. The best WW2 movie in some time.",Private

As you know, and as we continue to screen, most journalists will give just their reaction. We have reached out to Elvis Mitchell and are waiting to hear back.As a reminder, Interview Magazine is doing the November cover on Shia La Beouf.-What did you think of the overall story and pacing?I liked how the film just jumps right in and gets going - there's no time to dawdle in war, so I felt like the pacing was appropriate and I was in FURY mode fairly quickly. And everything leading up to that epic sequence at the end? I cried twice, jumped twice, and then nearly slid off my chair when Shia got shot... So yeah, I guess that means the story worked for me and I was engaged throughout the entirety of the film. The fact that this all took place over one day is both mind boggling yet totally realistic, which is probably the most disturbing part of the film - this was their everyday life and it was horrific. -How did you find the performances? Especially the five principals?I don't know how, but the five guys in the tank had such a palpable bond that you would think they've known each other forever... I don't know if that's good casting or great acting, but not once did I ever doubt their loyalty or purpose. Brad was a perfect Wardaddy and really felt like the patriarch of this family. Shia was outstanding in an unexpected role, as most would probably see him more as the crazy Bernthal character. Pena was great as well, but I think Logan was the real surprise here... This kid blew me away, it's a game changer for him. -Did you have any standout scenes?When Shia asked Logan ""are you a praying man,"" I got the chills - partially because I thought he was telling Logan ""if you're ever going to pray, now's the time"" and then because I realized he also saw the war as a religion - they had to believe in it like it's the law of god, because the things they were doing were too awful to contemplate otherwise - you know what I mean? The final fight was so well executed and impactful, and is probably one of my favorite scenes of the year - it gave me chills that I couldn't shake for several hours. The scene in the apartment with Brad, Logan and the two women was also a standout for me - it was a very smart way to show the desperate need for normalcy in all their lives. And of course, ""the best job I ever had"" hit me hard...-What did you think of the chemistry between the cast? Did any particular relationships stand out to you?See above, but the chemistry was there 150%. Brad and Logan's relationship probably stood out the most to me, they were pretty special together. Also, the fact that they all for back into the tank at the end, knowing what would happen without saying it, was very powerful... I liked that there was none of the ""tell my wife/family I loved her/them"" chatter showed that a) none of them thought they'd survive, and b) they were each other's family, they knew each other so well that words weren't necessary. Very powerful. -What letter grade would you give the film?I'd probably go with A-/B+, which puts it in my top ten for the year so far. -Did you find that you were watching Wardaddy and not Brad Pitt?Brad was Wardaddy - he absolutely was the character. -How does FURY compare to other brutal and honest war films? Can you liken it to any that have stayed with you?Last night I was thinking a bit about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but this morning I started thinking about HURT LOCKER - there's something very raw and emotional about this film, and it had a bit of each of these movies in it along the way. -Did any particular scene or set piece stand out for you?I'll go with the tank for the standout set piece - somehow it really felt like a ""home"" for these men, which isn't an easy thing to create. -What did you think of Shia’s performance?Shia literally brought me to tears - you can see the conflict in his character's eyes, the pain, the pride - all of it. He lost himself in the character, and it reminded me why I liked him in the first place. -What did you think of the below the line aspects of the film?Something about the set/staging felt a little unnatural to me in the beginning, but I think it was supposed to as there's really nothing ""natural"" about war. I think there was one scene where two missiles hit a German tank and the ""poof"" looked a little fake, but I know that's still being tweaked... Otherwise I felt the technical aspects of the film were very strong - costumes, makeup, props, all were stellar.

"Additional French screening reactions below. LE FIGARO – François Menia / POSITIVE The film is excellent. Brad Pitt and all the other actors act very well. There isn’t one acting better than another. The directing is perfect. I think David Ayer’s directing is really on the mark, and he achieved exactly what he wanted to.” JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE/Stephanie Belpeche/ POSITIVEWe just screened a grand film. I even preferred it to Saving Private Ryan. No sentimentalism a la spielberg; no close ups; just raw, dry, mud and , urine, the film is organic. I was very moved. I love David Ayer’s approach to films ; I was expecting another war film and this one is a great surprise. Even the way they die takes us by surprise. France 2 TV / Cultural editor/ POSITIVEI liked it alot. A pretty astounding piece of directing work played by very good actors POSITIF/ Philippe Rouyer/ POSITIVEI really loved this film. It’s like a Samuel Fuller film TELERAMA. Fr , Cultural weekly website / POSITIVEI rather liked it. It’s a solid classic war film. OUI FM radio/ MIXED POSITIVEI found the film uneven. The beginning is great but the end goes in all directions. In the 1st part there is a real tension, a real ‘behind the scenes’ of the war which I find really very good, but the sequence at the local’s home and the epic-apocalyptic ending made me disconnect. I need to think about it to mature my judgment. Les INROCKUPTIBLES trendy cultural weekly / MIXED NEGATIVE I’m a little mixed, I found the film remarkably well directed. I’m bothered by the forced patriotism (that’s not really an issue) but especially by all the references to Christ, portrayed by Shia Labeouf whose performance isn’t good. I have trouble with the Bible verses and heroism at the end; that said, David Ayer is a talented director, but we already knew that.

Michel Ciment, key opinion maker, director of respected institutional movie magazine” POSITIF”/POSITIVE “An excellent film, the best war movie I’ve seen since a very long time. One of the most authentic films on the war. A terrific directing job by David Ayer; the scene with the 2 German women is simply remarkable, a commanding scene. The 3 rd quality of the film is that one does not find any pleasure in the scenes where men are killed, it’s the message that war is terrible. For me, this film is on the same level as Full Metal Jacket.”Aurélien Allin and Spadacenta, movie journalists from movie monthly « CINEMATEASER »/POSITIVE“Good, really good. We were expecting even more violence as in David Ayer’s previous films” Marylin Letertre / METRO FREE DAILY/POSITIVE“A great film. Some expected scenes (suicide mission) or surprises (the lunch scene at the German’s house – all the guys are bastards without exception) there is a real tension in that scene”Sylvestre Picard/ PREMIERE movie monthly /POSITIVE“I really like it; a lot of dead on screen, a lot of tension ...""Xavier le Harpeur – STUDIO CINE LIVE/POSITIVE Great!""Thomas Colpaert / TELE 2 SEMAINE/POSITIVE/MIXED “A good film, maybe too talkative” From: Tesser-Marquez, Amy Sent: Monday, September 29, 2014 10:00 AMTo: Pascal, Amy; Belgrad, Doug; Minghella, Hannah; DeLuca, Michael; Clark, Nigel; van der Werff, Susan; ODell, Steven; Alexander, Ralph; Bruer, Rory; Caines, Dwight; Kaminow, David; Plishner, Elias; Napoli, Stefanie; Renz, Sandro; Caraco, Andre; Reich, Ileen; 'bblock@qedintl.com'; 'jl@grisbiprod.com'; 'jhegeman@qedintl.com'; 'alex@cravefilms.com'; 'jbing@bingcommunications.net'Cc: Mandrell, AjaSubject: FURY / FRENCH Screening Reactions Below please find a couple of reactions from this morning’s first press screening in Paris. Samuel Blumenfeld, LE MONDE daily (like NY Times) / POSITIVE “I found the film extremely well directed. All the cast are excellent. Especially Logan Lerman who I find even better than BP. But BP is always excellent. It’s very fluid in terms of directing. I didn’t see the 2 hours go by at all. Just the end is a little like “Fort Alamo” but the qualities of the film by far surpass my mixed feeling at the end” Pierre Rissient, Producer, and talent discoverer , very influential within the critic’s sphere in Paris /POSITIVE – mixed just for the end“a film much more ballsy than any other, one couldn’t have done that in the 50’s (Samuel Fuller “The Big red one”, or “The Bold and the Brave); David Ayer’s directing is excellent. The film has great qualities. Besides being realistic, actually the end is not so realistic. The end is ambivalent. So except for the last 20 minutes which are ambivalent, I liked it a lot. It’s surprising that BP’s character is so cultivated and should have been implemented at the beginning of the film. When he declares that ideals are peaceful, history is violent. Logan Lerman is even better than BP. All the actors are excellent.”",Private

The issue is that we cannot have the movie perceived as Brad Pitt and four others won the Second World War which is how it looks. It was a major issue in the reviews and perception of Saving Private Ryan which prompted comments of the lack of British involvement, rightly or wrongly, and that the Americans solved the whole problem. And if you want to go further back for Errol Flynn in Objective Burma it suggested he did it all on his own – equally derided.We do not want to infer that Brad Pitt choreographed the fall of Nazi Germany which is what this sequence does. So please can we have a different version for the UK.

The reason is there is that, extensive research has taught us that the movie can feel generic if you don’t mention key points that clarify the mission and raise the stakes, mainly 5 vs. 300. Without it, there’s no sense of threat. Hope this clarifies it.

It trivialises the whole premise and cheapens what should be positioned as a quality drama albeit with some convincing and exciting action. I half expected Jason Statham to turn up. We would not use this at all. The “Journey” trailer is considerably better and does at least convey the quality and intelligence of the movie however it does let itself down in the middle section where it dwells too long on the “five against three hundred” gung ho Americana. This is something we wish to avoid in our materials – the film itself just about gets away with that sentiment by having it strung out but once condensed it is very off putting due to its clichÃ©d nature.

"Elvis Mitchell sent this through...didn't elaborate any further but sharing this reaction....The scene in the house is an extraordinary sequence... while it seems digressive, it's completely pushing the story forward in emotional and narrative terms. and we know who each of those guys are in that house. it's refreshing to see a movie in which tension is subject of a movie in the most subtle way possible, and in which ptsd is illustrated as texture rather than declaimed as a story point.

As you know, and as we continue to screen, most journalists will give just their reaction. We have reached out to Elvis Mitchell and are waiting to hear back.As a reminder, Interview Magazine is doing the November cover on Shia La Beouf.-What did you think of the overall story and pacing?I liked how the film just jumps right in and gets going - there's no time to dawdle in war, so I felt like the pacing was appropriate and I was in FURY mode fairly quickly. And everything leading up to that epic sequence at the end? I cried twice, jumped twice, and then nearly slid off my chair when Shia got shot... So yeah, I guess that means the story worked for me and I was engaged throughout the entirety of the film. The fact that this all took place over one day is both mind boggling yet totally realistic, which is probably the most disturbing part of the film - this was their everyday life and it was horrific.-How did you find the performances? Especially the five principals?I don't know how, but the five guys in the tank had such a palpable bond that you would think they've known each other forever... I don't know if that's good casting or great acting, but not once did I ever doubt their loyalty or purpose. Brad was a perfect Wardaddy and really felt like the patriarch of this family. Shia was outstanding in an unexpected role, as most would probably see him more as the crazy Bernthal character. Pena was great as well, but I think Logan was the real surprise here... This kid blew me away, it's a game changer for him.-Did you have any standout scenes?When Shia asked Logan ""are you a praying man,"" I got the chills - partially because I thought he was telling Logan ""if you're ever going to pray, now's the time"" and then because I realized he also saw the war as a religion - they had to believe in it like it's the law of god, because the things they were doing were too awful to contemplate otherwise - you know what I mean? The final fight was so well executed and impactful, and is probably one of my favorite scenes of the year - it gave me chills that I couldn't shake for several hours. The scene in the apartment with Brad, Logan and the two women was also a standout for me - it was a very smart way to show the desperate need for normalcy in all their lives. And of course, ""the best job I ever had"" hit me hard...-What did you think of the chemistry between the cast? Did any particular relationships stand out to you?See above, but the chemistry was there 150%. Brad and Logan's relationship probably stood out the most to me, they were pretty special together.Also, the fact that they all for back into the tank at the end, knowing what would happen without saying it, was very powerful... I liked that there was none of the ""tell my wife/family I loved her/them"" chatter showed that a) none of them thought they'd survive, and b) they were each other's family, they knew each other so well that words weren't necessary. Very powerful.-What letter grade would you give the film?I'd probably go with A-/B+, which puts it in my top ten for the year so far.-Did you find that you were watching Wardaddy and not Brad Pitt?Brad was Wardaddy - he absolutely was the character.-How does FURY compare to other brutal and honest war films? Can you liken it to any that have stayed with you?Last night I was thinking a bit about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but this morning I started thinking about HURT LOCKER - there's something very raw and emotional about this film, and it had a bit of each of these movies in it along the way.-Did any particular scene or set piece stand out for you?I'll go with the tank for the standout set piece - somehow it really felt like a ""home"" for these men, which isn't an easy thing to create.-What did you think of Shias performance?Shia literally brought me to tears - you can see the conflict in his character's eyes, the pain, the pride - all of it. He lost himself in the character, and it reminded me why I liked him in the first place.-What did you think of the below the line aspects of the film?Something about the set/staging felt a little unnatural to me in the beginning, but I think it was supposed to as there's really nothing ""natural"" about war. I think there was one scene where two missiles hit a German tank and the ""poof"" looked a little fake, but I know that's still being tweaked... Otherwise I felt the technical aspects of the film were very strong - costumes, makeup, props, all were stellar.

It is definitely a film people want to sit with before discussing. They said that it is clear they both thought it was some great filmmaking and very well done. They both commented that the cast was excellent and that the five guys really feel familial which affects the emotional crescendo by the end of the film. More familial than collegiate,which they commented is a good thing. Elvis said it is very operatic and a very impressive piece of work. They talked about how great the ensemble is and he mentioned that you really remember each face.

"FW: Domestic/Intl proposed schedule FURY Doug, Just so you have the facts….as you’ll see from an email a little way down this chain, Cynthia had told us previously that Brad was good for Oct 18,19,20. But, with the possibility of the US now releasing on October 17, Brad may need to be in the US that week, which means that he’d need to be back on set on the Monday (per the email from Cynthia directly below). We would lose our Paris premiere, currently set for that Monday, but we feel that the LFF event and red carpet on the Sunday is still a viable opportunity for us.

Brad is available to shoot Aug 1 and 2nd. EW one of the days – and the John Balsom shoot the other day He said whatever works best - maybe the guys come in after the EW shoot to shoot with Balsom shoot since they’ll already be in hair and makeup. And then Brad would do a day with Balsom on his own. He can do the Mark Seliger shoot somewhere between Aug 6-8 for DETAILS in California. Confirmed for Bovington Museum Aug 28 and 29th Brad said looking good for European premieres on Aug 18, 19, 20 if you can confirm those are in fact premieres. He will not do press conferences but is more than happy to spend time and talk on the carpet He likes the Washington DC idea. Will try on AFI – but would most definitely be the last date, not the earlier one. He also said he doesn’t think he’ll be able to get out of work to do any of the Savannah stuff – since he’ll be doing a few days of work for International the week before. None of us understand the Miami of it all…why that location? Brad feels instead of typical press day the best hit for the movie/ best use of everyone’s time would be to spend a few days before or after DC visiting certain army bases (said to ask Ayer for the specific ones) and have a photographer and videographer capturing the moments of the cast shaking hands with the veterans and introducing the screening. That’s what should be aired/captured and sent out – not a typical press day. He would entertain something funny skit wise from Kimmel or Fallon – not in studio talking. But similar to what he did for WWZ Know Kimmel keeps trying so thought we should give him first crack.

"Screening Fury Hi Ralph, We screened FURY today. It is an impressive, raw and ultra-violent war movie. Brad Pitt is strong, we were pleasantly surprised by the performance of Shia LaBeouf, supporting cast all good. The acts of war, the way it has been photographed, it felt so realistic and gruesome that we sometimes thought we were watching a documentary. As we were already informed there will be some things edited out, we think that this would make sense, the scene in the house with the two women, the scene in the tank, near the confrontation with the SS division, it all felt very long. It is tempting to compare FURY with movies like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or PEARL HARBOUR, but these two, in our opinion were more epic and large scale and had a more interesting story. With hardly any female involvement and/or love interest (the scene in the house is not enough) and with all the terrible violence in the movie, we feel that it will be limited to younger and older men only, combined with an age rating of 16 the movie will have its limit with regards to box-office potential. If we look at comps there is a huge difference between the low and the high performers.

An email from Eric is below….he is obviously questioning the merit of a recruited screening. Does testing a subtitled print allow for a true read on reactions and a comparison to norms, given that the French audience is more used to seeing dubbed features? With regard to Russia, again, will the use of a Russian voice-over track for the screening allow us to effectively compare this available norms? Best,Nigel Dear Nigel,I know I was fine yesterday about a test screening in France, but, the more I think, the more I wonder how the conclusions of the test will help us to adapt our strategy on the movie, knowing that we open Oct 22 and that a big part of our campaign (postering in particular) will be have to be committed before the test screening.What do you think?BestEric From: Stapley-Tovey, Paul Sent: Friday, August 01, 2014 8:58 AMTo: Clark, NigelCc: Recio, Abe; Braddel, Mark; Scotti, Vincent; Stapley-Tovey, PaulSubject: Fury / test screenings - France & Russia using 7th August version Hi Nigel, FRANCEWe will start the subtitle translation with the current version to ‘break the back of it’. The writer has a holiday booked which falls before the 7th August version will be ready to work on which is good timing for us. We can simulate the subtitles in Paris on 26th August and then master and QC the subtitled DCP by the end of that week. This would give us a subtitled DCP in territory ready for screening on Monday 1st September. We could probably shave a couple days of this schedule if this can help with the research schedule. RUSSIAAnton would prefer to have a Russian Voice-Over (descriptive) track, rather than subtitles. I’ve copied Mark in case he wants to add background to this request. This does not require the creation of a ‘temp’ M&E so there is pretty much zero cost impact if we decide to go this route instead of with subtitles.If we start writing the translation on Monday with the current version we will be able to have either a subtitled or Voice-Overed DCP created and transmitted into Moscow by 28th / 29th August which would mean we would be ready to hold a screening from Monday 1st September onwards. Regards. Paul. From: Scotti, Vincent Sent: 01 August 2014 00:15To: Clark, NigelCc: Stapley-Tovey, Paul; Recio, AbeSubject: Re: Fury / test screenings - France & Russia Nigel, Thank you for your other email - we will not proceed with any work on a temp M&E. I presume with the August 7 version we would be looking at subtitles as we would be unable able to create a temp M&E from this version at any cost without jeopardizing the completion of the film on time. I defer to Paul on timings for the creation of subtitled versions for which he has noted he should have some info tomorrow. Paul - For reference I expect we would start to get reels of spotting matching the August 7 version beginning on August 15 and completing on August 19. This is on a rush and depending on the complexity of the changes - of which there are expected to be many from the 7/22 version - we will get out sooner if at all possible.

RUSSIA – think they can have dialogue recorded by 27th / 28th August if we decide to go with a ‘temp’ M&E. This would give a localised DCP to screen in territory from 8th September onwards. Regards.

After a few long conversations with the Sound Supervisor and Sony Sound today though this one may break the bank. If we pin the version that we work with at the August 7th version we would be looking at about $203k in order to have an M&E by the end of August in order to then mix a French a Russian version. Due to the complexity of the film, the way that it was mixed and that most of the foley is still be shot, and the fact that the post schedule is already compressed there is unfortunately no inexpensive or easy way to do this. This number presumes we had an official go by this Thursday - after that there we likely would not be able to get the resources from the production in order to duplicate everything over to a second sound crew to do the work.

Under the current Post Schedule the O/V DCP and M&E are due to complete on Saturday 20th September which means the earliest we could be ready to test with the final version would be sometime W/C 29th September. I’m guessing this might be too late for releases on 22nd October and 30th October so Vince and I looked at the what the best date would be for making a ‘temp’ M&E and O/V DCP (estimating 50K USD for this work) and we think that Picture Lock on 22nd August seems like a reasonably bet. This would have Dubbed versions ready to screen sometime during W/C 1st September if France and Russia can get the Dialogue recorded by then (this could be difficult for France because of actors being on holiday in August) – I’ll know more about this tomorrow.

"Hey Doug, I can't begin to tell you how many conversations we have had on estimating. Steven and I, as well as the territories want to get it right. This was a discussion we were always having with Jeff. Especially when a film like Fury needed a quick turn around. When the MPG wanted the film ( of course including all of us) we had to make it fit. In the future that can't happen. I do think that it is extremely important that the territory estimates are not to high or to low. This is a process that we in tandem with Production have to be alligned that we all feel comfortable with the numbers going forward. Certainly working towards estimates that we can not only achieve but exceed. I feel confident we are headed in the right direction. We will not let up until it is right. ----- Original Message ----- From: Belgrad, Doug Sent: Sunday, October 26, 2014 12:49 PM To: ODell, Steven Cc: Bruer, Rory Subject: Re: Fury Hey guys, The problem here is that both Peter and Steven were really confident about the movie. Australia likely will not get to their estimate (11?), UK won't approach Cap P perf in spite of LIFF premiere, and France opened #5! and seems like it has underperformed on every title this year. As you recall we took down the int'l estimate on Fury a few months ago and now we're going to considerably underperform that revised number. That's just not going to work. We should discuss who signed up for this movie way back when we acquired it, how the original estimates got set and what happened with the release. More generally, what's going on in Europe? Here's how it feels to me... Germany seems to be consistently setting low targets and over-performing, while UK is probably setting realistic targets and then underperforming. France targets are low and then they don't get to the numbers. Let's try to get our arms around this and go through the last set of films from ASM2 through Fury and determine whether my feelings are based in fact or if there is any pattern here. Can you put a report together for these key territories showing g'light estimates, revised estimates, actual performance and for EQ and Fury what the projected total (or range) looks like. Thanks.

Suffice to say they loved its integrity, human involvement and its straight forward intent to appeal to a broad audience. We would of course be happy to go back with a yes please however we do need to confirm talent access and whether we intend to pursue other festivals. Last year on Captain Phillips we found ourselves in a very compromising position where goal posts kept moving and our relationship with the LFF became untenable. We do need to go back to them with a clear remit of our intention, whatever it may be, however a world premiere of a movie shot in the UK with such a universal message must surely be a convincing argument. For the Festival we are pretty much close to the wire on deadline and would love to confirm asap. It is a marvellous opportunity to be embraced in every way. Regards Peter",Private

She said she “wanted more of it.” Not more of the violence, but more of the story. She thought that Shia LaBeouf’s performance was fantastic. She did think Brad Pitt was great and really liked the scene in the apartment with the girls. Elvis Mitchell/INTERVIEWElvis thought the scene in the house is an extraordinary sequence. He said that while it seems digressive, it's completely pushing the story forward in emotional and narrative terms and we know who each of those guys are in that house. He thought it is refreshing to see a movie in which tension is subject of a movie in the most subtle way possible, and in which PTSD is illustrated as texture rather than declaimed as a story point.",Private

I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity.

Nov. 27 or soon after without the word Fury in it (unless the video window short enough to allow SPHE to effectively advertise given the March 1 cutoff.

An email from Eric is below….he is obviously questioning the merit of a recruited screening. Does testing a subtitled print allow for a true read on reactions and a comparison to norms, given that the French audience is more used to seeing dubbed features? With regard to Russia, again, will the use of a Russian voice-over track for the screening allow us to effectively compare this available norms?

The writer has a holiday booked which falls before the 7th August version will be ready to work on which is good timing for us. We can simulate the subtitles in Paris on 26th August and then master and QC the subtitled DCP by the end of that week. This would give us a subtitled DCP in territory ready for screening on Monday 1st September. We could probably shave a couple days of this schedule if this can help with the research schedule. RUSSIA Anton would prefer to have a Russian Voice-Over (descriptive) track, rather than subtitles. I’ve copied Mark in case he wants to add background to this request. This does not require the creation of a ‘temp’ M&E so there is pretty much zero cost impact if we decide to go this route instead of with subtitles. If we start writing the translation on Monday with the current version we will be able to have either a subtitled or Voice-Overed DCP created and transmitted into Moscow by 28th / 29th August which would mean we would be ready to hold a screening from Monday 1st September onwards.

After a few long conversations with the Sound Supervisor and Sony Sound today though this one may break the bank. If we pin the version that we work with at the August 7th version we would be looking at about $203k in order to have an M&E by the end of August in order to then mix a French a Russian version. Due to the complexity of the film, the way that it was mixed and that most of the foley is still be shot, and the fact that the post schedule is already compressed there is unfortunately no inexpensive or easy way to do this. This number presumes we had an official go by this Thursday - after that there we likely would not be able to get the resources from the production in order to duplicate everything over to a second sound crew to do the work.

"Steven/Kathy, I have dropped a note to Sun...as it's their Thanksgiving Holidays thru. to Wednesday.....but I attach for your own info. his screening report. A couple of key factors here..as having spoken to him last week about this film I can advise the following. 1. He is going to submit his final estimate after viewing the final version....late September. He is going to get a shorter film...with edits but final rating is important to him. Can he revise /be a little more conservative or is he locked in now ? 2. The tour for Brad Pitt is now confirmed...Nov.12 & 13....but we are in a more competitive November release period....and right now...am checking that he is OK for a Nov.20 release given HUNGER GAMES 3 is on that date...and checking on how strong that franchise is . Maybe Nov. 13 is a possibility ? Speak later when I get more updates from him. Dear Steven Although this is not for the females film and war genre, this is anticipated and decent film to the male audience with high quality in almost every elements including Bred Pitt’s attraction. If we have a Brad Pitt’s junket and remove a few cruel scenes or cuts in order to get 15+ such as -Wardaddy stabs the eye of German soldier who rode white horse with knife. -Torn part of the face splattered when Norman cleans the bloodstain in FURY tank -Head of the American tank operator is blown away by attack of German soldiers my estimates are; Gross box office 15 billion KW/14.6 million USD Rental estimate 6.9 billion KW/6.7 million USD Releasing cost/450 screens 540 million KW/.5 million USD Adpub including junket 2.2 billion KW/2.1 million USD Net contribution 4.16 billion KW/4 million USD I presume the most similar recent comparable title is 300 which hit 18.7 billion KW/18 million USD as their gbo.

Have you been able to speak with production to see of they can build in a hiatus or otherwise minimize the cost if we need Brad the full week of October 13-20. I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity. In that scenario maybe we would try to tack on a few hours of work at the end of August when he's at Bovington for long lea",Private

We’re confident the Tour will also help us, even if we can’t host a Premiere like they did.It was sold in France as an action/comedy with local comedy Superstar Dujardin and 3 huge American stars. In our director-driven country, having an acclaimed director/star was also a huge plus. Our positioning and our film are radically different obviously. Having a better film (and better reviews) is our main advantage over Monuments Men. The first reviews for FURY are 4 stars out of 4, therefore we feel sharing excellent quotes with our potential audience is the best way to increase their interest. Press ads is the best option to share the quotes as we can’t do it on TV nor radio and it’s too late to add quotes to our posters. We’re also planning to use these quotes online. With the new poster in theaters last week, we’ve seen great increase in the interest tracking on all targets; therefore we’re confident that our “team” artwork will also work for the press ads.Ideally, we would run these press ads during the 4 days before our release to build the momentum at the right time. But if tracking is a priority on this title we can run them next week.Please advise if you agree with this strategy and when you want us to run the ads. We learned 2 things with Captain Phillips :- postering being our only mass media, we can’t afford to launch a film without a good poster. Our final poster for Fury may be a little late but it’s a great one that answers all the requests issued during the focus groups.- the theme seemed too close to the sad stories we see on TV every day. Even our very positive word of mouth was not enough to compensate. The focus groups confirmed Fury was a challenge (out of 29 people, only 3 selected Fury as their top choice VS 12 for Equalizer) mainly because our panels felt WWII movies are relatively tired/overdone. We can’t change the nature of our film but we can use quotes that insist that this is a spectacular quality film that needs to be seen on the big screen and try to focus more on heroics and friendship than deaths and war.

We have to do ‘Monuments Men’ business at least, and we’re some way behind them right now. Whilst I’m okay with spending the additional €70k, are the reviews so strong that review press ads are the best option? If we go this route, when will these review ads run?

The writer has a holiday booked which falls before the 7th August version will be ready to work on which is good timing for us. We can simulate the subtitles in Paris on 26th August and then master and QC the subtitled DCP by the end of that week. This would give us a subtitled DCP in territory ready for screening on Monday 1st September. We could probably shave a couple days of this schedule if this can help with the research schedule. RUSSIAAnton would prefer to have a Russian Voice-Over (descriptive) track, rather than subtitles. I’ve copied Mark in case he wants to add background to this request. This does not require the creation of a ‘temp’ M&E so there is pretty much zero cost impact if we decide to go this route instead of with subtitles.If we start writing the translation on Monday with the current version we will be able to have either a subtitled or Voice-Overed DCP created and transmitted into Moscow by 28th / 29th August which would mean we would be ready to hold a screening from Monday 1st September onwards.

After a few long conversations with the Sound Supervisor and Sony Sound today though this one may break the bank. If we pin the version that we work with at the August 7th version we would be looking at about $203k in order to have an M&E by the end of August in order to then mix a French a Russian version. Due to the complexity of the film, the way that it was mixed and that most of the foley is still be shot, and the fact that the post schedule is already compressed there is unfortunately no inexpensive or easy way to do this. This number presumes we had an official go by this Thursday - after that there we likely would not be able to get the resources from the production in order to duplicate everything over to a second sound crew to do the work.

Suffice to say they loved its integrity, human involvement and its straight forward intent to appeal to a broad audience. We would of course be happy to go back with a yes please however we do need to confirm talent access and whether we intend to pursue other festivals. Last year on Captain Phillips we found ourselves in a very compromising position where goal posts kept moving and our relationship with the LFF became untenable. We do need to go back to them with a clear remit of our intention, whatever it may be, however a world premiere of a movie shot in the UK with such a universal message must surely be a convincing argument. For the Festival we are pretty much close to the wire on deadline and would love to confirm asap. It is a marvellous opportunity to be embraced in every way. Regards Peter",Private
"Fury- Script Reaction Hola Frankly, we loved the script. We expected the script to have its ups and downs as almost of all war movies, but this one so straightforward. When there is no action there are really good dialogues. It makes you feel you´re part of Wardaddy´s team and travel inside the tank! The intensity and claustrophobic that Captain Philips made us feel during the scenes inside the rescue boat, will be very similar inside the tank… No doubt this is an Epic and Oscar contender movie and need to make the most of it. The only downside from the BO point of view, is that it might be too violent. Regardless the genre and the movie itself, this is mainly a Brad Pitt, and we should reduce the explicit violent scenes in our marketing materials in order to sell a more mainstream movie and make it more appealing for female audience highly interested in any Brad Pitt movie. Our projection is: BO estimate 7/8M Ad/Pub: 1.6M Prints: 450 Date: Jan 16th. Same pattern as Django ( 11M) and Wolf of Wall Street (12m) Title: In case we cannot go with Fury we rather go with something more emotional like : Corazones de Acero ( Hearts of Steel), balanced between action and emotion.

"RE: Fury Dates Steven, The best THEATRICAL date for the film in Australia & NZ is Nov. 27…..away from key competition and noise. This is 3 weeks after INTERSTELLAR…the biggest threat for sure…..and we avoid the earlier releasing SECRET SERVICE movie…which might be quite strong in our markets due to Colin Firth and its British casting. HUNGER GAMES on Nov. 20 big but not our market….. Our feeling is we open well enough and hold that way thru. to Xmas & beyond if critical/w.o.m. favours us. It’s the beginning of college/university vacations as well….. THE HOBBIT is a market changer too but again…we have to assume we will play modestly strong and hold our older adult audience. NZ impacted more by this of course. The issue with Home Entertainment in Australia is NOT a big one….it’s just asking if they can extend their in-season promotional activity by a wek or two…and not a game changer …they need for us to be as big as we can be.

Is going to double check deal with WB, but feels probably ok to disregard the video window issue if you are going to use a title without the word “fury” or a literal translation of the word in the title (hence “Men of Fury” wouldn’t be ok) Based on above, options seem to be: Oct 23, Oct. 30 or Nov. 13 with “Fury” in the title. Nov. 27 or soon after without the word Fury in it (unless the video window short enough to allow SPHE to effectively advertise given the March 1 cutoff.

The writer has a holiday booked which falls before the 7th August version will be ready to work on which is good timing for us. We can simulate the subtitles in Paris on 26th August and then master and QC the subtitled DCP by the end of that week. This would give us a subtitled DCP in territory ready for screening on Monday 1st September. We could probably shave a couple days of this schedule if this can help with the research schedule. RUSSIA Anton would prefer to have a Russian Voice-Over (descriptive) track, rather than subtitles. I’ve copied Mark in case he wants to add background to this request. This does not require the creation of a ‘temp’ M&E so there is pretty much zero cost impact if we decide to go this route instead of with subtitles. If we start writing the translation on Monday with the current version we will be able to have either a subtitled or Voice-Overed DCP created and transmitted into Moscow by 28th / 29th August which would mean we would be ready to hold a screening from Monday 1st September onwards.

After a few long conversations with the Sound Supervisor and Sony Sound today though this one may break the bank. If we pin the version that we work with at the August 7th version we would be looking at about $203k in order to have an M&E by the end of August in order to then mix a French a Russian version. Due to the complexity of the film, the way that it was mixed and that most of the foley is still be shot, and the fact that the post schedule is already compressed there is unfortunately no inexpensive or easy way to do this. This number presumes we had an official go by this Thursday - after that there we likely would not be able to get the resources from the production in order to duplicate everything over to a second sound crew to do the work.

I’m quite sure the film will have positive reactions from critics and industry press. There are some challenges which don’t let me be so optimistic about movie’s commercial potential here as I was a year ago when we initially discussed it. I was happy to realize that the number of very violent/tough scenes looked some softer than I could imagine them from reading the script. We still couldn’t feel much empathy to the character of Wardaddy. I believe it might cause a serious issue for general audience to receive the film well. I guess technically the main character is Norman but due to charisma of Brad Pitt (and his superstar status) much more attention is focused on him who’s personage in the story is too controversial . War drama is pretty challenging genre for Russia. In case of WW2 there are two factors those make it particularly complicated for our market in current political situation. - Huge anti-American buzz in Russian press and social media due to sanctions and situation in Ukraine - Specific view of classical Soviet/Russian history on the role of US in WW2. It was criticizing F.D.Roosevelt for waiting so long before starting ground operation against Nazis in Europe. Due of general downturn in political relationship this factor is getting stronger in very negative way. I believe we can minimize negative effect of factors above by focusing our campaign on several major selling points Obviously Brad is the most powerful asset for selling the film to broad audience Several battle scenes look very impressive (we will need pure action trailer as well ) The key characters look brutal but attractive I would suggest To position the movie more like a war action starring Brad rather than a war drama To avoid/conceal most tragic realities of the war (dead bodies in the mud, kids in Nazi’s uniform) To focus on battles, violent scenes where we see war daddy as a “badass guy” rather than a tragic character To include scenes when the guys talk about having sex with german girls including the one when Wardaddy insists Norman to have sex with young girl in the apartment. It will help us to present the characters in most realistic way not like “angels worriers” To emphasize Russian producer and director of photography The earliest test screening will be very helpful to understand if we are wrong in this approach I think we can make 200m (85m in revenue) from 650 screens with ad/pub of 35m. We need to be aggressive enough in our marketing to make people talk about the film to have strong opening. I believe the movie will be a strong debates generator. Even with mixed WOM we can expect strong hold on second weekend and further due to controversial theme. Please excuse me if I’m too straightforward in my comments. Hope it wasn’t rude",Private

Feeling is that because this one is a bit more real as a war movie, and not stylized like Tarantino and no strong German lead (Christoph Waltz), that Germany will not be as open to seeing their country's portrayal. S. Korea thinks that by being less stylized and more real and gritty, film has more potential.

"FW: FURY As discussed, reaction from Russia. From: Sirenko, Anton Sent: Thursday, July 31, 2014 1:32 PM To: Bruer, Rory; ODell, Steven; Clark, Nigel; Braddel, Mark Cc: Svetlorusov, Gregory Subject: FURY Dear Everyone, We screened the movie and enjoyed very charismatic characters and strong realistic feel of the epoch. I’m quite sure the film will have positive reactions from critics and industry press. There are some challenges which don’t let me be so optimistic about movie’s commercial potential here as I was a year ago when we initially discussed it. I was happy to realize that the number of very violent/tough scenes looked some softer than I could imagine them from reading the script. We still couldn’t feel much empathy to the character of Wardaddy. I believe it might cause a serious issue for general audience to receive the film well. I guess technically the main character is Norman but due to charisma of Brad Pitt (and his superstar status) much more attention is focused on him who’s personage in the story is too controversial . War drama is pretty challenging genre for Russia. In case of WW2 there are two factors those make it particularly complicated for our market in current political situation. - Huge anti-American buzz in Russian press and social media due to sanctions and situation in Ukraine - Specific view of classical Soviet/Russian history on the role of US in WW2. It was criticizing F.D.Roosevelt for waiting so long before starting ground operation against Nazis in Europe. Due of general downturn in political relationship this factor is getting stronger in very negative way. I believe we can minimize negative effect of factors above by focusing our campaign on several major selling points Obviously Brad is the most powerful asset for selling the film to broad audience Several battle scenes look very impressive (we will need pure action trailer as well ) The key characters look brutal but attractive I would suggest To position the movie more like a war action starring Brad rather than a war drama To avoid/conceal most tragic realities of the war (dead bodies in the mud, kids in Nazi’s uniform) To focus on battles, violent scenes where we see war daddy as a “badass guy” rather than a tragic character To include scenes when the guys talk about having sex with german girls including the one when Wardaddy insists Norman to have sex with young girl in the apartment. It will help us to present the characters in most realistic way not like “angels worriers” To emphasize Russian producer and director of photography The earliest test screening will be very helpful to understand if we are wrong in this approach I think we can make 200m (85m in revenue) from 650 screens with ad/pub of 35m. We need to be aggressive enough in our marketing to make people talk about the film to have strong opening. I believe the movie will be a strong debates generator. Even with mixed WOM we can expect strong hold on second weekend and further due to controversial theme. Please excuse me if I’m too straightforward in my comments. Hope it wasn’t rude",Private
"Dear All, After all our marketing activities culminated in a very well publicized local premiere on a Dutch army base (despite some very challenging weather circumstances) and a visit from director David Ayer and actor Logan Lerman, it was the time to the let the ‘child’ go and prove itself in the harsh and serious environment of the Thursday opening night at the Dutch cinemas. It is still holidays in the middle and southern part of the Netherlands, and FURY opened with almost 92k being ranked 3rd, with local family movie DUMMY THE MUMMY being first in its 3week with 179k, followed by THE MAZE RUNNER holding remarkably well in its 5th week with appr. 96k. Since MONUMENTS MEN is our most important comparison: Previews Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Weekend Total GBO Fury (91 screens) € 91.586 € 90.695 The Monuments Men (100 screens) € 23.031 € 57.256 60% € 131.921 -100% € 181.098 -100% € 96.991 -100% € 467.266 -81% € 1.680.900 The Thursday of FURY is in the autumn holidays of the middle and the south of the Netherlands. The Thursday of MONUMENTS MEN was the spring holiday for the middle and the south of the Netherlands. As far as our intelligence goes, FURY opened with 20% more in the US compared to MONUMENTS MEN, we opened 60% better. We know that reviews have been better for FURY than for THE MONUMENTS MEN. FURY has Imax, MONUMENTS MEN did not. The age rating for MONUMENTS MEN was 12, for FURY this is 16, based upon the gruesome violence. MONUMENTS MEN was released in a weekend with low temperatures between 3 and 10 degrees Celcius, and lots of rain, we will get better weather this weekend, with average temperatures around 16 degrees Celcius MONUMENTS MEN showed a rather high Thursday-Weekend ratio of 8 (between 6 and 7 being the norm), I think the opening evening of FURY is a little bit bloated with Fan boys rushing out and because of Imax. I do not think we will reach the same level of weekend ratio, however an opening weekend between 400k and 500k is highly likely, which should give us a good position to reach the planned lifetime target of 1.6 million in LC. Kind Regards, Karel",Private
"Dear Martin, Sonja, We have a recruited screening planned, and that will tell us a good deal about the potential of FURY in Germany. I recall on the conference call with Amy and Doug recently you mentioned that one of the challenges of the film for Germany was its brutality and its typicality, as opposed to ‘Saving Private Ryan’ which offered a unique look at the human side of war. Should we be looking to ‘cheat’ our marketing campaign in Germany? Perhaps we emphasize the relationship between Brad and Logan, the mentor and the recruit, the father-son type of bond that they have? In any event, downplay war, the 5 vs. 300, the ‘Germany is the enemy’ and rather stress Logan’s journey, Brad’s promise to keep his crew alive etc. In terms of creative advertising, rather than the five crew members on the tank, perhaps the poster features just Brad and Logan? We can definitely change out the ‘War Never Ends Quietly’ copy-line for a more personal alternative. Would it be too extreme to consider a new title at this stage? We can even create new clips if that helps. Looking forward to discussing in more detail soon.

Norbert Körzdörfer / Bild Zeitung - positive„Quite good and impressive. I especially liked how the film showed the transformation from child to man.”Harald Pauli / Focus - positive""This film is rather complex. I didn't expect that after all those bad US reviews. I found it quite impressive and multi-layered. It shows how war turns humans into animals. But this film is not very commercial of course. Who want's to see that?!"" Andreas Borcholte / Spiegel Online - positive -mixed„I liked it quite well. But the film is too long. To justify that length it needs a drama – which the film doesn’t really deliver. But the film was very interesting and has some great scenes like e.g. the living room scene.” Lars Olav Beier / Spiegel - positive -mixed„All in all certainly quite good. Just at the end it gets a little too pathetic. And, the film is too long. This is probably because Ayer is also the writer. The living room scene is great. And Shia LaBeouf and Logan Lerman are great as well. I almost didn’t recognize Jon Bernthal.” Robert Hofmann / DVD-Kritik - positive„Not as pathetic as I had feared. Brutal. All in all I liked it. Personally, I also liked to see the pure tank battle scenes. Towards the end it resembles Saving Private Ryan.” Tomasso Schultze / Blickpunkt Film - positive ""I still have to think about it but I can already say that I liked it much more than the US reviewers did. It reminded me on ""Steiner - The Iron Cross"" from the Seventies. And as far as I recall it, this is the first time that an American WW2 film shows not just the Germans performing their dirty business but also the Americans themselves. All behave like barbarians. That was very impressive and unexpected. I've already seen some footage at a tradeshow and found it too stylish. But the movie is much better.""David Steinitz / Süddeutsche Zeitung - positive -mixed""A very strange movie. The staging was great. But I dont know what the ethics of the story should be.""Emanuel Pavel / Syndication Sairvice - positive""What a horrible, brutal movie - positively meant. I guarantee four Oscars - for Logan Lerman, the music and the sound plus sound mixing.""Friederike Albat / Madame - negative""Horrible! This is not a movie for our magazine. I couldnt see a story.""",Private

Suffice to say they loved its integrity, human involvement and its straight forward intent to appeal to a broad audience. We would of course be happy to go back with a yes please however we do need to confirm talent access and whether we intend to pursue other festivals. Last year on Captain Phillips we found ourselves in a very compromising position where goal posts kept moving and our relationship with the LFF became untenable. We do need to go back to them with a clear remit of our intention, whatever it may be, however a world premiere of a movie shot in the UK with such a universal message must surely be a convincing argument. For the Festival we are pretty much close to the wire on deadline and would love to confirm asap. It is a marvellous opportunity to be embraced in every way. Regards Peter",Private

You feel like you live that war with the men, and their ""fighting unit"" was realistic. The violence was realistic - it is what it is.

"FURY - Intl Theatrical Marketing Strategy UPDATE Dear All, Please find attached the updated International Theatrical Marketing Strategy for FURY. Reactions from early taste-maker screenings in the US have been very positive, underlining the fact that FURY is both a commercial and a quality movie. The male audience will be drawn to the unique and authentic action set pieces and the camaraderie between the members of Fury’s crew, whilst the hook for females will be the appeal of the cast, along with the emotional pull of the father/son-like relationship between Pitt and Lerman’s characters. More discerning audiences will recognize the obvious quality of director David Ayer’s filmmaking as well as outstanding performances by a gifted ensemble cast. As ever, if you have any questions please don’t hesitate to call me or one of my colleagues here at Home Office. Best regards, Nigel p.s.

"Re: FURY SCREENING DCP REQUEST - KOREA Hi Stephen, I didn't envisage night vision goggles. My concern is that the film will be screening in an environment where the public have potential access, so having someone posted on the door - and in the projection booth I assume - should suffice.

"Reactions to Fury Script Netherlands Dear All, As discussed yesterday herewith the Dutch reactions to the script of Fury. The script is impressive in its objective (and sucess) to show us the horror of war in general and that of 2nd worldwar in particular. Although it is tempting to compare it to movies such as Inglourious Basterds (but Tarentino brand) and Saving Private Ryan, in my opinion there is less at stake than getting Private Ryan home and it seems that Fury is more a chapter in warfare without a real beginning (but with a real end). Above all it is ultra violent and the age rating is within a few seconds 16, this means that our audience will be a bit limited. It is very good to have Brad Pitt attached to this project, but I am afraid that his female fans will sniff out the fact that this movie is very violent and meant for older men with a lot of interest for WW2 movies. We have a very strong cast attached, the materials are shaping up if I look at trailers and one sheet concept, we should use this to our best.

"Hey guys, The problem here is that both Peter and Steven were really confident about the movie.

As you recall we took down the int'l estimate on Fury a few months ago and now we're going to considerably underperform that revised number. That's just not going to work. We should discuss who signed up for this movie way back when we acquired it, how the original estimates got set and what happened with the release. More generally, what's going on in Europe? Here's how it feels to me... Germany seems to be consistently setting low targets and over-performing, while UK is probably setting realistic targets and then underperforming. France targets are low and then they don't get to the numbers. Let's try to get our arms around this and go through the last set of films from ASM2 through Fury and determine whether my feelings are based in fact or if there is any pattern here.

As you know, and as we continue to screen, most journalists will give just their reaction. We have reached out to Elvis Mitchell and are waiting to hear back.As a reminder, Interview Magazine is doing the November cover on Shia La Beouf.-What did you think of the overall story and pacing?I liked how the film just jumps right in and gets going - there's no time to dawdle in war, so I felt like the pacing was appropriate and I was in FURY mode fairly quickly. And everything leading up to that epic sequence at the end? I cried twice, jumped twice, and then nearly slid off my chair when Shia got shot... So yeah, I guess that means the story worked for me and I was engaged throughout the entirety of the film. The fact that this all took place over one day is both mind boggling yet totally realistic, which is probably the most disturbing part of the film - this was their everyday life and it was horrific. -How did you find the performances? Especially the five principals?I don't know how, but the five guys in the tank had such a palpable bond that you would think they've known each other forever... I don't know if that's good casting or great acting, but not once did I ever doubt their loyalty or purpose. Brad was a perfect Wardaddy and really felt like the patriarch of this family. Shia was outstanding in an unexpected role, as most would probably see him more as the crazy Bernthal character. Pena was great as well, but I think Logan was the real surprise here... This kid blew me away, it's a game changer for him. -Did you have any standout scenes?When Shia asked Logan ""are you a praying man,"" I got the chills - partially because I thought he was telling Logan ""if you're ever going to pray, now's the time"" and then because I realized he also saw the war as a religion - they had to believe in it like it's the law of god, because the things they were doing were too awful to contemplate otherwise - you know what I mean? The final fight was so well executed and impactful, and is probably one of my favorite scenes of the year - it gave me chills that I couldn't shake for several hours. The scene in the apartment with Brad, Logan and the two women was also a standout for me - it was a very smart way to show the desperate need for normalcy in all their lives. And of course, ""the best job I ever had"" hit me hard...-What did you think of the chemistry between the cast? Did any particular relationships stand out to you?See above, but the chemistry was there 150%. Brad and Logan's relationship probably stood out the most to me, they were pretty special together. Also, the fact that they all for back into the tank at the end, knowing what would happen without saying it, was very powerful... I liked that there was none of the ""tell my wife/family I loved her/them"" chatter showed that a) none of them thought they'd survive, and b) they were each other's family, they knew each other so well that words weren't necessary. Very powerful. -What letter grade would you give the film?I'd probably go with A-/B+, which puts it in my top ten for the year so far. -Did you find that you were watching Wardaddy and not Brad Pitt?Brad was Wardaddy - he absolutely was the character. -How does FURY compare to other brutal and honest war films? Can you liken it to any that have stayed with you?Last night I was thinking a bit about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but this morning I started thinking about HURT LOCKER - there's something very raw and emotional about this film, and it had a bit of each of these movies in it along the way. -Did any particular scene or set piece stand out for you?I'll go with the tank for the standout set piece - somehow it really felt like a ""home"" for these men, which isn't an easy thing to create. -What did you think of Shia’s performance?Shia literally brought me to tears - you can see the conflict in his character's eyes, the pain, the pride - all of it. He lost himself in the character, and it reminded me why I liked him in the first place. -What did you think of the below the line aspects of the film?Something about the set/staging felt a little unnatural to me in the beginning, but I think it was supposed to as there's really nothing ""natural"" about war. I think there was one scene where two missiles hit a German tank and the ""poof"" looked a little fake, but I know that's still being tweaked... Otherwise I felt the technical aspects of the film were very strong - costumes, makeup, props, all were stellar.

It is definitely a film people want to sit with before discussing. They said that it is clear they both thought it was some great filmmaking and very well done. They both commented that the cast was excellent and that the five guys really feel familial which affects the emotional crescendo by the end of the film. More familial than collegiate,which they commented is a good thing. Elvis said it is very operatic and a very impressive piece of work. They talked about how great the ensemble is and he mentioned that you really remember each face. They will follow up for more detailed reaction on Monday. *Elvis would like a 10-15minute phoner with David Ayer for the intro of the Shia Q&A.

"FURY Dear David, I just called to let you know I was sending a summary of our thoughts, but I'm sure you're in the tunnel preparing the film for the screening next week, so I left word for you. I'm keeping to the big notes here, so that we don't get bogged down in detail. We're very much looking forward to seeing the film play with an audience and making sure the movie fully delivers on your amazing screenplay and the outstanding performances. As mentioned, the main story which feels like it's working very well is the relationship between Norman and WarDaddy. This is the heart and soul of our movie. And experiencing the story from Norman's point of view, the clerk/typist thrown into the belly of the beast as a member of the tanker unit, is a great way into to tell the story. Anything you can do to maintain focus on the central relationship and make sure that we understand how Norman is thinking, feeling and reacting will enhance our experience. You've done a brilliant job creating secondary characters and casting them with actors who give fine performances, but please consider paring back material that does not fully support the A story. In the main, we also feel some of the action sequences lack tension and geography. The idea that danger and death lurks around every corner is interesting, but we don't feel the underlying anxiety that will keep us on the edge of our seat throughout and we want that feeling. Overall, it feels like the scene-setting, introduction of WarDaddy and his crew, and then Norman's arrival and hazing takes just a bit too long. The story really kicks in when Norman first tastes battles as part of the Fury crew and is proven to be a weak link. There is much set-up to be done before that point, but is it possible to get through it all a bit more efficiently. Norman's hazing seems overlong and it seems to take a long time to get from Waggoner's orders to the beet field. Once WarDaddy gets his orders and heads to the beet field is there a way to maintain forward momentum and tension. Have you tried cross cutting to the Nazi position and showing the burned out halftracks and men pinned down and under enemy fire. When the tanks roll past the halftracks and the few men that are there it’s anticlimactic. Also when they all stop and start to cross over the first hedgerow one expects engagement and instead there is another hedge row to go through before the action begins. As a general point, since the tanks move rather slowly, some of the tension in the action sequences seems to dissipate. And the traveling sections sometimes feel a bit languidly paced for that reason. As we discussed, we love the apartment scene. It works beautifully as the mid-point of WarDaddy's relationship with Norman. But we feel like the story overstays it's welcome. The idea that the rest of the tank crew invades the lovely scene, as war returns to sully the respite that Don and Norman seem to deserve, may not be entirely necessary. The mere fact that as soon as the boys leave the apartment it's blown up and innocent young Emma is killed, serves the very same purpose. We would also strongly encourage you to look at that section without having Coon-Ass sully the moment and then Gordo tell the story about executing the horses. Parenthetically, we understand the idea of Coon-Ass and his behavior are likely quite authentic, but in a few places -- the initial hazing, the inter-cutting of his sex in the tank with N's sweet encounter, the crew dinner in the apartment, and the aftermath of Emma's death -- the performance seems a bit distracting and gets in the way of our engagement. WarDaddy's admission to Norman about his past is a pivotal moment in the story and really locks the whole movie into place. It's not quite clear what prompts WarDaddy to share this heavy secret at this particular moment so the confession seems just a tiny bit forced. Also, Norman's line about not being a bartender or his priest doesn't ring quite true, either. This is a huge moment and for the most part is working quite well, so please understand we're just trying to help you perfect it. The cross roads ending is out of sync with audience time once Logan races back to the tank having spotted the storm troopers. We have to have the scene where they all decide to stay as well as the preparation in the tank (which should be cut much more rapidly ending with Don’s drink and Bible’s Job quote) and perhaps lose Norman and Coon-Ass going to the barn to retrieve the German body and then burning it. There may be a bit more gore and ugliness than is absolutely necessary. We are fully aware of and embrace the idea that to convey the horrors of war you need to show it. But there are times where material feels a touch gratuitous. For example, the thematic thread about killing horses no longer seems to add to the experience. Some of that material from the script seems to have already fallen away and, although that element worked beautifully in the script, we find that in the cut, the talk from Coon-Ass about it in the tank, and then Gordo's dinner table story don't add to the emotional experience. Please consider eliminating the remnants of this idea. Thanks for listening. We love this movie! Doug",Private

As you know, and as we continue to screen, most journalists will give just their reaction. We have reached out to Elvis Mitchell and are waiting to hear back.As a reminder, Interview Magazine is doing the November cover on Shia La Beouf.-What did you think of the overall story and pacing?I liked how the film just jumps right in and gets going - there's no time to dawdle in war, so I felt like the pacing was appropriate and I was in FURY mode fairly quickly. And everything leading up to that epic sequence at the end? I cried twice, jumped twice, and then nearly slid off my chair when Shia got shot... So yeah, I guess that means the story worked for me and I was engaged throughout the entirety of the film. The fact that this all took place over one day is both mind boggling yet totally realistic, which is probably the most disturbing part of the film - this was their everyday life and it was horrific. -How did you find the performances? Especially the five principals?I don't know how, but the five guys in the tank had such a palpable bond that you would think they've known each other forever... I don't know if that's good casting or great acting, but not once did I ever doubt their loyalty or purpose. Brad was a perfect Wardaddy and really felt like the patriarch of this family. Shia was outstanding in an unexpected role, as most would probably see him more as the crazy Bernthal character. Pena was great as well, but I think Logan was the real surprise here... This kid blew me away, it's a game changer for him. -Did you have any standout scenes?When Shia asked Logan ""are you a praying man,"" I got the chills - partially because I thought he was telling Logan ""if you're ever going to pray, now's the time"" and then because I realized he also saw the war as a religion - they had to believe in it like it's the law of god, because the things they were doing were too awful to contemplate otherwise - you know what I mean? The final fight was so well executed and impactful, and is probably one of my favorite scenes of the year - it gave me chills that I couldn't shake for several hours. The scene in the apartment with Brad, Logan and the two women was also a standout for me - it was a very smart way to show the desperate need for normalcy in all their lives. And of course, ""the best job I ever had"" hit me hard...-What did you think of the chemistry between the cast? Did any particular relationships stand out to you?See above, but the chemistry was there 150%. Brad and Logan's relationship probably stood out the most to me, they were pretty special together. Also, the fact that they all for back into the tank at the end, knowing what would happen without saying it, was very powerful... I liked that there was none of the ""tell my wife/family I loved her/them"" chatter showed that a) none of them thought they'd survive, and b) they were each other's family, they knew each other so well that words weren't necessary. Very powerful. -What letter grade would you give the film?I'd probably go with A-/B+, which puts it in my top ten for the year so far. -Did you find that you were watching Wardaddy and not Brad Pitt?Brad was Wardaddy - he absolutely was the character. -How does FURY compare to other brutal and honest war films? Can you liken it to any that have stayed with you?Last night I was thinking a bit about SAVING PRIVATE RYAN but this morning I started thinking about HURT LOCKER - there's something very raw and emotional about this film, and it had a bit of each of these movies in it along the way. -Did any particular scene or set piece stand out for you?I'll go with the tank for the standout set piece - somehow it really felt like a ""home"" for these men, which isn't an easy thing to create. -What did you think of Shia’s performance?Shia literally brought me to tears - you can see the conflict in his character's eyes, the pain, the pride - all of it. He lost himself in the character, and it reminded me why I liked him in the first place. -What did you think of the below the line aspects of the film?Something about the set/staging felt a little unnatural to me in the beginning, but I think it was supposed to as there's really nothing ""natural"" about war. I think there was one scene where two missiles hit a German tank and the ""poof"" looked a little fake, but I know that's still being tweaked... Otherwise I felt the technical aspects of the film were very strong - costumes, makeup, props, all were stellar.

"WSJ: Hollywood: Go Big or Go Third Party Doug participated in this story on background with my encouragement. Thanks. http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304868404579192891681999588 Hollywood: Go Big or Go Third Party Independents Are Financing More Middle-Budget Movies, as the Major Studios Focus on 'Tentpoles' By Ben Fritz Nov. 17, 2013 7:37 p.m. ET 'American Hustle,' a new movie with an A-list ensemble cast, will be distributed by Sony Pictures next month, but it was financed by the much smaller, independent Annapurna Pictures. Columbia Pictures Soon after the smack-talking teddy-bear comedy ""Ted"" grossed a spectacular $568 million at the box office last summer, NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke had good news for Wall Street: ""We'd like to see a 'Ted 2' as soon as we can."" What Mr. Burke didn't mention: ""Ted 2"" isn't the media conglomerate's movie to make. That is because the original was financed by an independent company, with Universal Pictures handling distribution and marketing. It is a growing trend among Hollywood's legacy studios, which these days are inclined to put most of their chips on big-budget ""tentpole"" superhero movies and sequels with a built-in following rather than gamble on an original, middle-budget film with less potential to be a global blockbuster. The shift reduces their downside exposure to some of the riskiest movies, but also limits the upside potential on surprise successes in a business full of them. Moreover, because money is power, it undercuts the traditional role of major studios— Comcast Corp.'s CMCSA +0.08% Universal,Time Warner Inc. TWX -1.11% 's Warner Bros., Walt Disney Co. DIS -0.03% , Viacom Inc. VIAB -0.36% 's Paramount Pictures, Sony Corp.'s 6758.TO +0.54% Sony Pictures Entertainment, and 21st Century Fox Inc. FOXA +0.18% 's Twentieth Century Fox—as the be-all and end-all of Hollywood's moviemaking machine. Some of that power has recently shifted to low-profile, privately backed companies like Media Rights Capital, which financed ""Ted"" for about $50 million and then sold distribution rights to Universal. The studio has scheduled ""Ted 2"" for July 2015, but it hasn't yet secured an agreement to release it, according to people with knowledge of the continuing negotiations. MRC, meanwhile, has closed its own deals with director Seth MacFarlane and star Mark Wahlberg and expects to start shooting next June. If the companies can't come to terms—which the people involved said appears unlikely—the highly anticipated sequel could be released by one of Universal's competitors. Of the 81 movies with budgets over $30 million being released this year by major studios' core labels, 19 were financed either primarily or entirely by privately backed outside companies. In the prior four years, the average was 11 independently financed movies out of 95 total. Red Granite Pictures financed 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' which Paramount Studios will distribute. Paramount Pictures and Red Granite Pictures/Associated Press ""The scale of the movies being made independently has grown significantly in the past few years,"" said Rena Ronson, co-head of United Talent Agency's independent film group. Once primarily focused on low-budget films, independents are now regularly backing productions that cost more than $100 million, like August's science-fiction movie ""Elysium"" and December's Martin Scorsese-Leonardo DiCaprio drama ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" In the past the actors and directors who worked with such companies were frequently too early or late in their careers to get a glance from major studios. But the group now includes major stars like Brad Pitt, Denzel Washington and Jennifer Lawrence. (See related article on page B6.) Directors including Mr. MacFarlane, Neill Blomkamp (""Elysium"") and David Ayer (""End of Watch"") are each making their second movie in a row for an independent company. ""It's very difficult to get the stories a filmmaker wants to tell with his own voice made at the studios now,"" said Mr. Ayer, speaking from the British set of his $80 million World War II movie ""Fury,"" starring Mr. Pitt. ""That's why this new paradigm of independent financing at a higher level is exciting."" Though they are produced outside of the traditional Hollywood system, many independently financed pictures are released by major studios, which are still the only companies able to market and distribute a motion picture world-wide. But in most cases it was the independent that bought the script, signed deals with talent and put together the budget. That is exactly the type of painstaking, often fruitless expense that cost-conscious studios have cut back on in recent years. ""We completely commit to every element of the movie and go to the studios with it all in place, including a start date,"" said Bill Block, chief executive of QED International, the backer of ""Fury."" Independent financiers aren't a new phenomenon in Hollywood. Past hits like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Blind Side"" weren't made by the studios that released them. But Brad Weston, CEO of the 22-year-old independent film company New Regency, said as studios have cut back, ""we see more filmmakers come to us."" Though they still make a few original dramas, like September's hit ""Captain Phillips,"" studios now do so infrequently and on tight budgets. Senior studio executives privately say they wish they could make more such movies, which align with their personal tastes, but have difficulty justifying them financially. ""Our sweet spot is content the big boys love and respect but might be a little too risky for them,"" said Joey McFarland, vice chairman of Red Granite Pictures, which financed ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" Of course, assuming the risk studios don't want means more opportunities to lose money. Media Rights Capital had a spotty record at the box office before ""Ted,"" with flops including ""The Box"" and ""30 Minutes or Less."" The January drama ""Broken City,"" starring Russell Crowe and Mark Wahlberg and financed by Emmett/Furla Film and Envision Entertainment, grossed a weak $19.7 million. The deals on such productions vary greatly, depending on how much of a film's equity the backers sell to distributors. Universal paid a flat fee for global rights to the first ""Ted""—and kept much of the profit. But MRC will likely opt to retain a large s Attachments: image001.jpg (58489 Bytes)",Private

"FURY - Preliminary Intl Theatrical Marketing Strategy Dear All, Please find attached the Preliminary International Theatrical Marketing Strategy document for FURY. A powerful and captivating drama set in the closing months of WWII, ‘Fury’ is shaping up to be a major movie for our fourth quarter 2014. Brad Pitt is a huge star, here supported by a very accomplished ensemble cast, and director David Ayer (‘End of Watch’) brings grit and realism to the filmmaking. As ever, if you have any questions please don’t hesitate to call me or one of my colleagues here at home office.

"RE: Fury publicity Doug, Lesher called me earlier. He really wants us to commit to the LFF. As he sees it, regardless of whether we move the US date or not, LFF is a prestigious platform for the international launch, and will secure as much publicity as we could hope for in a one-stop environment. I agree with him. The bottom line is that regardless of the on-going negotiation over Brad’s travel to the US, the LFF closing night is happening on 10/19, and we have that weekend (the 18th and 19th) cleared in his diary. As Brad was not due to be working those two days, I’m assuming there’s no cost involved in closing the set. If we ultimately lose the Monday and forego the Paris premiere, so be it.

I understand that production is Monday through Friday, and this would mean that we need a Monday on top of the five days the week of the 13th. If absolutely necessary, we would look at eliminating the Paris premiere on Monday night, so that Brad could be back to work on Monday the 20th. Alternatively, we could try to condense his schedule for domestic publicity.

"Reactions from our 2nd French screening below. Michel Ciment, key opinion maker, director of respected institutional movie magazine” POSITIF”/POSITIVE “An excellent film, the best war movie I’ve seen since a very long time. One of the most authentic films on the war. A terrific directing job by David Ayer; the scene with the 2 German women is simply remarkable, a commanding scene. The 3 rd quality of the film is that one does not find any pleasure in the scenes where men are killed, it’s the message that war is terrible. For me, this film is on the same level as Full Metal Jacket.”Aurélien Allin and Spadacenta, movie journalists from movie monthly « CINEMATEASER »/POSITIVE“Good, really good. We were expecting even more violence as in David Ayer’s previous films” Marylin Letertre / METRO FREE DAILY/POSITIVE“A great film. Some expected scenes (suicide mission) or surprises (the lunch scene at the German’s house – all the guys are bastards without exception) there is a real tension in that scene”Sylvestre Picard/ PREMIERE movie monthly /POSITIVE“I really like it; a lot of dead on screen, a lot of tension ...""Xavier le Harpeur – STUDIO CINE LIVE/POSITIVE Great!""Thomas Colpaert / TELE 2 SEMAINE/POSITIVE/MIXED “A good film, maybe too talkative” From: Tesser-Marquez, Amy Sent: Monday, September 29, 2014 10:00 AMTo: Pascal, Amy; Belgrad, Doug; Minghella, Hannah; DeLuca, Michael; Clark, Nigel; van der Werff, Susan; ODell, Steven; Alexander, Ralph; Bruer, Rory; Caines, Dwight; Kaminow, David; Plishner, Elias; Napoli, Stefanie; Renz, Sandro; Caraco, Andre; Reich, Ileen; 'bblock@qedintl.com'; 'jl@grisbiprod.com'; 'jhegeman@qedintl.com'; 'alex@cravefilms.com'; 'jbing@bingcommunications.net'Cc: Mandrell, AjaSubject: FURY / FRENCH Screening Reactions Below please find a couple of reactions from this morning’s first press screening in Paris. Samuel Blumenfeld, LE MONDE daily (like NY Times) / POSITIVE “I found the film extremely well directed. All the cast are excellent. Especially Logan Lerman who I find even better than BP. But BP is always excellent. It’s very fluid in terms of directing. I didn’t see the 2 hours go by at all. Just the end is a little like “Fort Alamo” but the qualities of the film by far surpass my mixed feeling at the end” Pierre Rissient, Producer, and talent discoverer , very influential within the critic’s sphere in Paris /POSITIVE – mixed just for the end“a film much more ballsy than any other, one couldn’t have done that in the 50’s (Samuel Fuller “The Big red one”, or “The Bold and the Brave); David Ayer’s directing is excellent. The film has great qualities. Besides being realistic, actually the end is not so realistic. The end is ambivalent. So except for the last 20 minutes which are ambivalent, I liked it a lot. It’s surprising that BP’s character is so cultivated and should have been implemented at the beginning of the film. When he declares that ideals are peaceful, history is violent. Logan Lerman is even better than BP. All the actors are excellent.”",Private

Would like credits animated to fly in - example, BRAD fly in from right, larger than the screen, seeing imagery through the letters, PITT fly in from left, letters larger than the screen, see text through the letters, then the text crosses each other for BRAD PITT alignment, then pull out or shrink lettering to realize/see text and that you have been looking through the letters7. Does not like shot of stitching up face8. All images need to be PG139.

Angola and Mozambique only open today.We don’t have a War movie for some time, so statistics may not be totally accurate.But this leads to a weekend from 180k to 200k (Equalizer did 205).However, this movie is having a wider media coverage and recognition than Equalizer.I believe we are in line for the budget, but this will depend on the weekend.

"Fury tracking has changed little since last Friday, though we see some good moves forward with young males. Overall we are at 5% unaided, 64% aware, 43% definite interest, and 6% first choice. Young males are the real story when looking at the quads, as they double unaided, add a point of awareness, five points of definite interest, and two points of first choice. Males under 25: 8/66/47/10 Males 25 and over: 7/78/49/10Females under 25: 3/55/33/2Females 25 and over: 5/59/41/4 To get a better idea of just how strong we are with young males, we took out the teens 12-16 from the males under 25, since they can’t buy a ticket. Among males 17-24 we look fantastic at 11% unaided, 68% aware, 49% definite interest, and 17% first choice. We still look quite good against our comps, though to keep looking that way we will want to begin to add more unaided and first choice as we approach opening.

Hispanic tracking needs to start growing unaided, but our definite interest and first choice reach new highs (3/67/51/11). On our date, The Best of Me is struggling to find their audience, with females 25+ (4/52/38/6) still unwilling to embrace the film. Book of Life barely moves from where they were last week on tracking, and their Hispanic numbers (1/64/45/5) fail to reach previous highs in any measure but awareness. We still have 53% of our media left to run, plenty in the tank to close strong. In the next few days we are on Gotham, NCIS, playoff baseball, Monday Night Football, Kimmel, Letterman, Good Morning America, Seth Meyers, the premiere of American Horror Story, plenty of Sportscenter, O’Reilly Factor, and much, much more. We continue our Discovery cross network sponsorship, ESPN custom spots, and USA custom vignettes. We have our Hispanic press day in Miami tomorrow, Michael Pena tapes his appearance on Ellen today, and Jon Bernthal will be on Kimmel tomorrow. We have done a great job boosting our young male numbers and now we look strong with males across the board. This was a huge moviegoing weekend, so people’s thoughts and mindshare today are still with Annabelle and Gone Girl. However, the goal over the next eleven days is clear, we need to grow urgency and be top of mind. We have the plan and the tools to get this done, and make Fury a dominant presence not just on our weekend, but on what looks to be a lackluster weekend after us. With good reviews starting to come in, we are well positioned to be the movie for people who like quality movies, who like great action, who like war movies, people who like a great story, and people who like Brad Pitt. Over the next eleven days we’ll make sure none of those people can escape our message.",Private

"FURY Dear Everyone, We screened the movie and enjoyed very charismatic characters and strong realistic feel of the epoch. I’m quite sure the film will have positive reactions from critics and industry press. There are some challenges which don’t let me be so optimistic about movie’s commercial potential here as I was a year ago when we initially discussed it. I was happy to realize that the number of very violent/tough scenes looked some softer than I could imagine them from reading the script. We still couldn’t feel much empathy to the character of Wardaddy. I believe it might cause a serious issue for general audience to receive the film well. I guess technically the main character is Norman but due to charisma of Brad Pitt (and his superstar status) much more attention is focused on him who’s personage in the story is too controversial . War drama is pretty challenging genre for Russia. In case of WW2 there are two factors those make it particularly complicated for our market in current political situation. - Huge anti-American buzz in Russian press and social media due to sanctions and situation in Ukraine - Specific view of classical Soviet/Russian history on the role of US in WW2. It was criticizing F.D.Roosevelt for waiting so long before starting ground operation against Nazis in Europe. Due of general downturn in political relationship this factor is getting stronger in very negative way. I believe we can minimize negative effect of factors above by focusing our campaign on several major selling points Obviously Brad is the most powerful asset for selling the film to broad audience Several battle scenes look very impressive (we will need pure action trailer as well ) The key characters look brutal but attractive I would suggest To position the movie more like a war action starring Brad rather than a war drama To avoid/conceal most tragic realities of the war (dead bodies in the mud, kids in Nazi’s uniform) To focus on battles, violent scenes where we see war daddy as a “badass guy” rather than a tragic character To include scenes when the guys talk about having sex with german girls including the one when Wardaddy insists Norman to have sex with young girl in the apartment. It will help us to present the characters in most realistic way not like “angels worriers” To emphasize Russian producer and director of photography The earliest test screening will be very helpful to understand if we are wrong in this approach I think we can make 200m (85m in revenue) from 650 screens with ad/pub of 35m. We need to be aggressive enough in our marketing to make people talk about the film to have strong opening. I believe the movie will be a strong debates generator. Even with mixed WOM we can expect strong hold on second weekend and further due to controversial theme. Please excuse me if I’m too straightforward in my comments. Hope it wasn’t rude",Private

A question on the the title for FURY. War movies never do too well and I wonder whether we should try to reach a broader audience give we have Brad Pitt and go with the Spanish title equivalent (Corazones de Acero). Kind of like Braveheart. Everyone will know already that it is a war movie with all the TV spots. We might be able to get women to join their men this way (the film is violent so we have to get them in early). The titles coming in right now are all very male centric. What do you think?

Does not want to use stencil style lettering5. Wants to go with a block letter/Arial style font - please present options6. Would like credits animated to fly in - example, BRAD fly in from right, larger than the screen, seeing imagery through the letters, PITT fly in from left, letters larger than the screen, see text through the letters, then the text crosses each other for BRAD PITT alignment, then pull out or shrink lettering to realize/see text and that you have been looking through the letters7.

Logan is incredible, as you all said he was, and all the grime and dirt just oozed off the screen. And I still have a knot in my stomach thinking about the battle with the Tiger. And last 20 minutes.

I will continue to update and send on as I receive more. Very many thanksZoe TOTAL FILM / Richard Jordan – POSITIVEThanks for having me along to the screening last night. I thought the film was great – super-intense and authentic, it was kind of an assault on the senses (in a good way), the story and script were tight and the performances were fantastic across the board. In my opinion it's the best film David Ayer has made yet and I reckon it's going to be up there with some of the best war movies. DAZED & CONFUSED / DAZED DIGITAL / Trey Taylor – POSITIVEI absolutely loved it - Logan is an undisputed star! THE GUARDIAN / Catherine Shoard – POSITIVEI thought it was really interesting! Loads of fodder for stories, v gripping and well played (Pitt esp) tho sometimes seemed to slip slightly into cliche. Four stars I reckon. THE GUARDIAN / Henry Barnes – POSITIVE / MIXEDI liked it. Pitt was great. The atmosphere was believably miserable and I am glad it wasn't sanitised. Lerman did a decent job with a slight part. On the other hand: the depiction of the Germans was over-worked to the point of being insulting, the supporting characters were too broad, the ending strayed from the gritty realism we'd been given up to that point. Edging on a 4 star. SHORTLIST / Andrew Dickens – POSITIVEI was going to say I really enjoyed it, but that's definitely the wrong verb. I thought it was very good. Ambitious, honest and as brutal, intense portrayal of WW2 as I have ever seen. There were a couple of cheesy moments and I'd question the pace and distance of Norman's descent into lusting killer, but maybe that happened. Also, I was slightly disappointed that, having been shot four times (which didn't seem to affect him much), then inside a tank with two exploding grenades, then left dead for several hours, Brad Pitt looked like he was having a nap, with perfect hair and a slight skin rash. Considering the gore levels elsewhere, I think it was a bit of a cop out and more realism would've served to make a more impactful final scene. That aside, great performances all round, particular Shia L and Jon B, in what really felt like an old-fashioned war film with 21st century levels of realism. GOOD MORNING BRITAIN (ITV1) / Nick Rylance - POSITIVEIt's incredible I loved it. Tense, gripping, moving, jumpy, compelling to watch. Terrific performances.Probably the best war film I've seen in many years - opens up a whole area I knew nothing about, and a story well worth telling. Edge of my seat. A great cinematic experience. HEAT / THE GUARDIAN / Charles Gant – POSITIVEI liked it, strong performances, nicely delineated characters and effectively plunges you into the battle, ie very evocatively filmed. Scene with the two women was a nice counterpoint.I've always thought Logan Lerman was an underrated actor, so nice to see him being entrusted with this role.The depiction of the final heroic act (one Sherman tank v an entire SS battalion) seems so specific, you want it to be based on something that actually happened in reality, otherwise you feel like it's a Boy's Own fantasy, and I'm not sure what exactly the film is saying.The overall setting -- the SS forcing women and children to fight in the dying weeks of the war or face being strung up as a coward -- does give it a firm anchor. FREELANCE / THE INDEPENDENT / METRO – James Mottram – POSITIVEI have to say, I thought it was pretty amazing. Brutal, gritty, terrifying - quite a watch really. One of Brad's best. Even Shia wasn't annoying! And Logan L. was excellent...it's his film really. FREELANCE / SUNDAY TIMES CULTURE – Ryan Gilbey – MIXEDI wasn't nuts about it. It was spectacularly shot, especially the final battle. The cinematography was really rich and vivid. But I think there was a personality crisis in the film between two types of filmmaking. I couldn;t understand why David Ayer went to all that considerable trouble to make it authentic and explicit - from the horrible first scene to various icky details like the bodies being flattened by tanks - only to then smother the movie in the most awful corny syrupy score, which basically undermined the gritty effect. It's like it wanted to be both Come & See AND The Dirty Dozen (Saving Private Ryan had the same problem but not as bad). And it was a bit of a Nazi-killing wet-dream videogame. The only German soldier who came close to being an actual character was the conveniently nice one who spares Norman. Inglourious Basterds may have been a fantasy but even that showed that there were brave Germans too. Anyway, that's my take. LITTLE WHITE LIES / Adam Woodward – MIXEDI must say I thought the action sequences were incredible, some of the best I've seen since Band of Brothers. But story wise I felt it laid it on a little thick.",Private
"We have just started to screen the film for our junket journalists who are interviewing talent in Paris this weekend. Below are the first reactions from the Spanish press. Acción - Monthly movie magazine - POSITIVEReaction: One of the best war films I have seen in years. A very strong plot that takes you to the core of a war, without holding any punches and with a dark sense of humor, with almost no place for hope. The film keeps you glued to your seat for more than 2 hours and almost has like a supernatural look in some of the scenes. Magnificent direction, great cast. I can’t wait to see it again. ECARTELERA - Third most important movie website in Spain POSITIVEI found FURY one to the most intense war films I have seen in a long time. David Ayer has done wonders with the combat scenes. They are so close that they impact very much. They perfectly help you to understand what a war means. Perhaps is less convincing in the moments where there is no combat, with situations excessively sentimental. But the epic tone that he carries thru the whole movie, the wonderful Steven Price’s soundtrack and the interpretations, especially Bernthal’s and Lerman’s compensate that. Brad Pitt does a good job as well, but we are more use to seeing him as the hero and as a father figure, so no surprise there. Generally speaking, the film is epic.",Private
"Tonight's All Guild screening of Fury was at the AMC Lincoln Square in NY in the big house and was a great success. It was attended by SAG, PGA and WGA members. Every seat was taken and every person there stayed for the Q and A with David Ayer, Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shia LaBoeuf, Michael Pena and John Bernthal. Marshall Fine, NYFCC, moderated a great 25 min Q and A where David Ayer and all of the actors discussed the training, boot camp, the bond they formed, shooting in the tank, last night's premiere, and what a great experience making the movie was for each of them. A nice end to the Domestic press activities and now they are all on the way to the airport to meet our International team in Europe.

It got strong applause and a standing ovation when David Ayer walked in. FIlm played to a packed house and more than 2/3 stayed for the 30 min Q &A with David Ayer and Logan Lerman. Conversation touched on the attention to detail paid to the uniforms, tanks, weapons, etc...how Brad Pitt came to be part of the project, working with Brad Pitt, Logan Lermans preparation for the film, the boot camp the actors went thru, David Ayers's history and his family's history as veterans, some history of WWII. David and Logan were incredibly articulate and did a terrific job. They stayed after to take photos and answer questions with audience members.

Does not want to use stencil style lettering5. Wants to go with a block letter/Arial style font - please present options6. Would like credits animated to fly in - example, BRAD fly in from right, larger than the screen, seeing imagery through the letters, PITT fly in from left, letters larger than the screen, see text through the letters, then the text crosses each other for BRAD PITT alignment, then pull out or shrink lettering to realize/see text and that you have been looking through the letters7. Does not like shot of stitching up face8. All images need to be PG139. Can be the more violent stuff, i.e. firing, blowing stuff up, some dead bodies, but not too gruesomeI think that is everything for now.

I will continue to update and send on as I receive more. Very many thanksZoe TOTAL FILM / Richard Jordan – POSITIVEThanks for having me along to the screening last night. I thought the film was great – super-intense and authentic, it was kind of an assault on the senses (in a good way), the story and script were tight and the performances were fantastic across the board. In my opinion it's the best film David Ayer has made yet and I reckon it's going to be up there with some of the best war movies. DAZED & CONFUSED / DAZED DIGITAL / Trey Taylor – POSITIVEI absolutely loved it - Logan is an undisputed star! THE GUARDIAN / Catherine Shoard – POSITIVEI thought it was really interesting! Loads of fodder for stories, v gripping and well played (Pitt esp) tho sometimes seemed to slip slightly into cliche. Four stars I reckon. THE GUARDIAN / Henry Barnes – POSITIVE / MIXEDI liked it. Pitt was great. The atmosphere was believably miserable and I am glad it wasn't sanitised. Lerman did a decent job with a slight part. On the other hand: the depiction of the Germans was over-worked to the point of being insulting, the supporting characters were too broad, the ending strayed from the gritty realism we'd been given up to that point. Edging on a 4 star. SHORTLIST / Andrew Dickens – POSITIVEI was going to say I really enjoyed it, but that's definitely the wrong verb. I thought it was very good. Ambitious, honest and as brutal, intense portrayal of WW2 as I have ever seen. There were a couple of cheesy moments and I'd question the pace and distance of Norman's descent into lusting killer, but maybe that happened. Also, I was slightly disappointed that, having been shot four times (which didn't seem to affect him much), then inside a tank with two exploding grenades, then left dead for several hours, Brad Pitt looked like he was having a nap, with perfect hair and a slight skin rash. Considering the gore levels elsewhere, I think it was a bit of a cop out and more realism would've served to make a more impactful final scene. That aside, great performances all round, particular Shia L and Jon B, in what really felt like an old-fashioned war film with 21st century levels of realism. GOOD MORNING BRITAIN (ITV1) / Nick Rylance - POSITIVEIt's incredible I loved it. Tense, gripping, moving, jumpy, compelling to watch. Terrific performances.Probably the best war film I've seen in many years - opens up a whole area I knew nothing about, and a story well worth telling. Edge of my seat. A great cinematic experience. HEAT / THE GUARDIAN / Charles Gant – POSITIVEI liked it, strong performances, nicely delineated characters and effectively plunges you into the battle, ie very evocatively filmed. Scene with the two women was a nice counterpoint.I've always thought Logan Lerman was an underrated actor, so nice to see him being entrusted with this role.The depiction of the final heroic act (one Sherman tank v an entire SS battalion) seems so specific, you want it to be based on something that actually happened in reality, otherwise you feel like it's a Boy's Own fantasy, and I'm not sure what exactly the film is saying.The overall setting -- the SS forcing women and children to fight in the dying weeks of the war or face being strung up as a coward -- does give it a firm anchor. FREELANCE / THE INDEPENDENT / METRO – James Mottram – POSITIVEI have to say, I thought it was pretty amazing. Brutal, gritty, terrifying - quite a watch really. One of Brad's best. Even Shia wasn't annoying! And Logan L. was excellent...it's his film really. FREELANCE / SUNDAY TIMES CULTURE – Ryan Gilbey – MIXEDI wasn't nuts about it. It was spectacularly shot, especially the final battle. The cinematography was really rich and vivid. But I think there was a personality crisis in the film between two types of filmmaking. I couldn;t understand why David Ayer went to all that considerable trouble to make it authentic and explicit - from the horrible first scene to various icky details like the bodies being flattened by tanks - only to then smother the movie in the most awful corny syrupy score, which basically undermined the gritty effect. It's like it wanted to be both Come & See AND The Dirty Dozen (Saving Private Ryan had the same problem but not as bad). And it was a bit of a Nazi-killing wet-dream videogame. The only German soldier who came close to being an actual character was the conveniently nice one who spares Norman. Inglourious Basterds may have been a fantasy but even that showed that there were brave Germans too. Anyway, that's my take. LITTLE WHITE LIES / Adam Woodward – MIXEDI must say I thought the action sequences were incredible, some of the best I've seen since Band of Brothers. But story wise I felt it laid it on a little thick.",Private

"Here's to a great night! THR: Brad Pitt to Toast Veterans at 'Fury' Washington Premiere By Tatiana Siegel October 15, 2014 Retired four-star general Colin Powell and former Army Chief of Staff George Casey will join the actor for Wednesday's gala in Washington, D.C. This story first appeared in the Oct. 24 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. It will certainly pose a logistical headache. But for the first time in the studio's history, Sony is throwing a world premiere in Washington. On Oct. 15, the Newseum in D.C. will host a gala for the World War II film Fury, drawing elusive celebrities including the film's star Brad Pitt and even harder red-carpet gets like retired four-star general Colin Powell and former Army Chief of Staff George Casey. ""Security is certainly more rigorous [than for a New York or L.A. premiere],"" says Sony marketing president Dwight Caines — himself the son of a veteran — who got goose bumps stepping into a Sherman tank during production. In recent years, Sony has held special screenings of Black Hawk Down, Zero Dark Thirty and Captain Phillips in the nation's capital. But for its first full-blown premiere on the Delaware, the studio is displaying the kind of pageantry reserved for an inauguration. The U.S. Color Guard will present the flag, and the national anthem will be performed. Sharing space on the red carpet with Pitt and Sony brass including Amy Pascal, Doug Belgrad and Michael De Luca will be there with World War II vets — all in their 90s — who served as advisors on the film and who will be escorted by members of the U.S. Old Guard. Soldiers who protect the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier will participate as well. At the center of the red carpet will be a so-called Wall of Honor, where talent like the film's director David Ayer (himself a Navy veteran) and guests will have the opportunity to write a personalized note to active military overseas. (Pitt plans to write a note thanking them for their service.) ""This is the kind of movie that warranted it,"" adds Caines. ""At the script stage, we always thought D.C. might be an opportunity [for a premiere] because the movie as it was conceived really pays homage to the servicemen and -women who protect us. When we saw the movie, that idea just solidified."" Jean Guerin Senior Vice President, Media Relations Sony Pictures Entertainment 310.244.2923",Private

The reviews averaged the three star level being more positive toward the premise and the first half of the movie. With the well-publicized issues with the film, specifically the last third, critics tended to follow that lead. As you can see that mid-range response in no way affected the result and that’s partly due to there being absolutely no issue here with the image of Brad Pitt in the UK. Tabloid favourite and almost universally positive. Regards,",Private

"Fury I am delighted to say that following the screening today the Festival would be delighted to offer the closing night slot for our movie. Suffice to say they loved its integrity, human involvement and its straight forward intent to appeal to a broad audience. We would of course be happy to go back with a yes please however we do need to confirm talent access and whether we intend to pursue other festivals. Last year on Captain Phillips we found ourselves in a very compromising position where goal posts kept moving and our relationship with the LFF became untenable. We do need to go back to them with a clear remit of our intention, whatever it may be, however a world premiere of a movie shot in the UK with such a universal message must surely be a convincing argument. For the Festival we are pretty much close to the wire on deadline and would love to confirm asap. It is a marvellous opportunity to be embraced in every way. Regards Peter",Private

We are out on 337 screens...double prints in all the Major 8-plexes and above...so with a long movie, session times are advantageous.Need to gross as much as we can before INTERSTELLAR hits us in 2 weeks time. Opening Day Estimates:- CAPTAIN PHILLIPS LC$308,971 (Opening Weekend $2.2 mill/Final $9.6 mill.)MONUMENTS MEN LC$347,000 (Opening Weekend $2.3 mill/ Final $8.8 mill.)GREEN ZONE LC$314,000 (Opening Weekend $1.9 mill./ Final $6.6 mill.)

"Ralph, Looks like we had an English version cam out of the Philippines. SM Cinema MEGAMALL3/F, SM MEGAMALL BLD AEDSA COR. JULIA VARGAS AVEMANDALUYONG CITYPhilippines We’ve intercepted it so it is currently NOT on the Internet. Our security detail did help though because they initially tried camming one of the locations the MPAA was protecting and stopped because they saw security. They made another run at a nearby theatre the next day. Worth having our local guys reach out to this theatre to tighten up their ship. As usual though, I would not tell them that we intercepted and it is not currently on the Internet. As an aside, it looks like there is a cammer (Pimp4003) that has acquired an English version cam and is going to post it the Internet later today (or tomorrow). He is notorious for doing this and has a history of taking his cams straight to a public source (see article below). I’ll let you all know once we do find a cam that is publicly available. My team has already alerted our Internet takedown vendors so they are watching closely. I’ve already alerted Rory to this cammer’s proposed release earlier today. Best,Sean Pimp4003 increases their volume of new camcord releases on public websitesCreated by WebWatch Uploading unique cams on public websites has recently become one of the biggest trends in movie piracy. Historically, the vast majority of theatrical picture sources were first posted at private BitTorrent websites where membership is closely monitored. However, approximately 50% of the new cams obtained by WebWatch so far this year were first posted on public websites, such as extratorrent.cc, thepiratebay.se, and kickass.to. During the past few months, Pimp4003 has undoubtedly been one of the most active release groups in terms of uploading unique camcord sources on public websites. While Pimp4003 has existed since July 2012, they increased their volume of new camcord releases starting in August of this year. Since August 2014, Pimp4003 has been responsible for nine of the new cams obtained by WebWatch. Two of these nine cams were captured from the same theater in Toronto, Canada, while five of them were captured from the same theater in Harvey, Louisiana (this particular theater located in Harvey was also the source of at least five unique cams that were made publically available by the previously active English release group MATiNE). The five cams that were traced back to Harvey, Louisiana were captured approximately one to two weeks prior to being made publically available online, suggesting that they originated from hard goods. In addition, Pimp4003 credits the user shop3001 for two of these five camcord releases; shop3001 was previously active on thepiratebay.se as they uploaded at least two new cams between March and April 2014, both of which were also suspected to have originated from hard goods.Based on earlier research, Pimp4003 is suspected to be comprised of a single individual, whose real life identity is well known. He maintains a very public online footprint, operating his own website, pimp4003.net, (previously pimp4003-torrents.com, pimp4003-torrents.me, pimp4003-torrents.forums-free.com) as well as multiple Facebook and Twitter profiles. The owner is constantly interacting with individuals in these public spaces, encouraging users to ask him questions on Facebook or on instant messenger. He has recently starting pleading with members to donate funds to help with his server rentals, offering to provide a custom built encryption application for people who donate. He claims to have created the encryption software himself, which offers ""15 different levels of encryption"" preventing ISPs from being able to see a user's traffic. In order to function correctly, he asks users to provide him with their ISP details, and in return he will provide them with the custom encryption software. While WebWatch isn't in a position to speak to the claims related to the encryption software, we find it curious that someone who is so concerned with encryption and anonymization also maintains an open and active online profile.

"The Last Samurai-Ideas for Fury- Steven, The Last Samurai seems to highlight two conflict narratives: Man vs. Himself first and then Man versus Man. Tom Cruise's character is first battling his own demons and then the Samurai; though they spare him and co-opt him to fight for their cause as he reforms himself and conquers his own demons. This movie is about his journey. Both Fury and The Last Samurai at a high level have similarities: -Big Male Sex Symbol Star (Tom and Brad) -War movies -Epic Style -Big fight scenes -Both lead characters willing to die for their cause Links to the trailers for The Last Samurai are below. The trailers below highlight the following: ""In the face of his enemy"" ""In the heart of one man lives . . ."" "" The Soul of a Warrior"" ""Courage"" ""Loyalty"" ""Honor"" Or ""In the name of honor"" ""In the face of battle"" All of the spots below prominently feature spectacle, battle scenes, nature scenes and tease the Japanese love interest.

They're starting to cast Sinister Six and we've been telling them how great the cast is in Fury. Have a great weekend. Doug",Private
"Overall a mixed but generally positive reaction across groups. The groups consisted of boys 15-17, adults 18-24 (mixed gender), adults 25-29 (mixed gender) and adults 30-39 (mixed gender). Groups were exposed to 5 Payoff print executions, 2 OOH Billboards, 2 trailers and 4 positioning statements. Print alone struggled to connect in a meaningful way but trailers raised interest from moderate to good levels. Notably interest tended to soften with increasing age (i.e. teen males were largely committed based on the trailers, while the oldest groups were more hesitant) KEY OPPORTUNITIES· Groups were consistently attracted by the sense of unity among a team of heroes. Though Pitt was a solid asset, most were less interested in a movie focussed on his character alone than one that explored the team dynamics and their individual personalities. · A sense of suspense, especially the overwhelming odds against the team - the idea of 5 vs 300 struck a chord with most. While action was an important element, especially for men, groups wanted to know that the team was on a heroic mission, and the ‘last hope’ for many. The question of whether they succeed was compelling.· Most were motivated by the idea of experiencing the emotion and tragedy of war. Avenues for this took a couple of forms: o Wardaddy’s promise to keep the team alive had solid traction, but a number agreed that a stronger sense that one or more of them might die would add an important element of (emotional) suspense, which could have been stronger. As one older woman stated “I want to feel that there’s only two of them left at the end, and that suspense over what happens to the other crew members”.o The story of a rookie (Norman) was a solid entry point for both men and women – a number imagined that he would carry them through the movie and that they would share his experiences as he matured, especially teen boys. As one teen said “You’re there in the rookies shoes and you become more war hardened as you go”. KEY CHALLENGES· Genre confusion based on print alone. Groups struggled to identify the setting and tone of the film based on the print shown (before AV). Though it was clearly a ‘war film’ the tone ranged from sad to comedic (often compared to Inglourious Basterds based on the team print), or from drama to sci-fi (along the lines of Independence Day but ‘without the aliens’).· World War II setting a little ‘tired’. Once identified as set in WWII, many felt that the historical aspects were important, especially the sense that this could have really happened. However, on the flip side, the ‘war movie’ genre was not only off-putting for some, but considered a little ‘overdone’. As one older man explained, “I’m tired of World War I and II movies, they keep reminding us of something that happened years ago”.· Some sense the movie might be too masculine / limited in appeal. Those holding back across the adult groups often felt that the movie was for others rather than them and their friends – either their parents/older age groups, fans of war movies or only for men. Some felt that hints of elements such as lighthearted moments between team members or the romance would help to broaden appeal (though this was clearly not a comedy or a love story). SUMMARY OF MATERIALS· Print # 871 showcasing the team atop the tank was a consistent favorite, especially after seeing AV. Prints showing just Pitt were considered relatively limited and too reliant on his star power alone. o There was however, some traction for OOH Billboard #820 showcasing a more pensive Pitt over the canon, giving the sense that something terrible has either just happened or is going to happen.· Trailer C edged ahead of Trailer D due in part to its greater sense of the 5 different personalities, relatively linear storytelling and more compelling introduction of the rookie hook. Stand out AV moments included: o “it’s 5 against 300” (both trailers)o Sequence showing the Germans climbing onto the tank (Trailer D)o “Best job I ever had” (Trailer C)o Norman jumping at the gunfire (Trailer C)· There was not a clear favorite amongst the positioning statements. Groups were relatively divided between positionings centred around the team, the mission and Wardaddy (mainly his promise to keep his team alive, and the question around whether he could or not) INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS- Avoid selling the movie as a Pitt vehicle, the ensemble has stronger potential- Consider highlighting the role of the rookie, Norman. In particular his journey or maturation, and aim to use his introduction to Wardaddy and the tank/crew as an entry point.- A priority across the campaign should be to promote the unity within the team, especially their solidarity and ‘never give up’ attitude in the face of the impossible.- Aim to engage audiences with their individual personalities more – they need to be able to relate to these characters and invest in them emotionally. - War themes are dominating perceptions, but the aim should be for goodwill towards the team to dominate – this should help mitigate negative preconceptions around war films, and show how this film is different.- Lighter interactions and hints at romance can help broaden the proposition and offer tonal variety, especially when targeting women.

"Unasked for opinion: Fury doesn't feel like it has scale. Even if the movie doesn't have the shots I suggest getting one or two from movies u own and put them in the spots....it's a cheat but it could open the movie to more people who might see ""just"" a tank movie as less compelling or don't feel the stakes of the movie. Another idea.... I remember one of the things I loved about the ww2 movies I grew up with was looking at the larger picture of where the troops were moving so u got that what was at stake was simply diagrammed and if the Germans got past x point we were in big trouble.

"RE: Unbroken Trailer Hola Ralph, We think Unbroken is not as big as Fury. It might be an epic story but it has no cast and Angelina Jolie behind the camera is not an asset. We´ve got an epic war movie with the biggest star in the world!!!. They should move! Mid Jan is always a great date for adults movies but it´s even better to take a 100% advantage of the Oscar nominations & Awards Please find following some examples to support our date: Wolf of Wall Street opened on Jan 17th 2014 and grossed 12.1M euros…. against the 4th week of The Physician ( 6.9M) and the 4th week of Mitty ( 5.8M) Django opened on Jan 18th 2013 grossing 10.7M … against Lincoln ( 5.1M) and the 4th week of Miserables ( 8.5M) Seven Pounds opened on Jan 16th 2009 grossing 9.9M… against the 4th week of Australia ( 11.1M) Sherlock Holmes opened on Jan 16th 2010 grossing 10.1M …against the 4th week of It´s Complicated (4.7M) and the 5th of Avatar (76.3M) As you can see, it´s not only that mid Jan is a great date but also the above examples show that there is room for more than one similar adult film. We definitely propose to stay where we are.

And you own it. I love the idea of live theater on television. It's how television started. There are three movies I want to write.1. Flash Boys. I've spent some time with Scott and we're meeting again next week. We think we have a fun take on a good guys on Wall Street story.2. The Politician. I optioned this book when it came out a few years ago. It's written by Andrew Young, the aide to John Edwards who falsely claimed paternity of Rielle Hunter's baby to cover for his hero and boss. He then received immunity from the Justice Department in exchange for being the government's star witness in the case against Edwards. There's much more to this story than what was in the tabloids and I think enough time has passed now for it not to seem like a ripped-from-the-headlines movie. Two great roles.3. Molly's Game. Molly Bloom was the 3rd best skier in the country when she was a senior at the University of Colorado with a 4.0 GPA. A wipe-out during Olympic trials kept her off the team and sent her life on a bizarre trajectory. 10 years later 20 FBI agents would be pointing automatic weapons at her while she stood at her apartment door in the middle of the night. In between she ran the most exclusive high stakes poker game in Hollywood and then New York, where she didn't realize she was being run by the Russian mob. The book itself isn't very good. But just as you could take The Accidental Billionaires and make it a movie about college kids throwing cash up in the air and dancing with hookers on yachts, there's a much more interesting and poignant story than just the decadence of the underground poker scene. I just wanted to catch you up on where I was and tell you how excited I am to get moving again on Steve Jobs. I hope you're well.Aaron",Private

Dear Ivan Please, we are about to do a huge promotional release with media and press coverage, for a more “arty” program within our cinema chain (Palacio del Cine), we will call so Palacio del 7°Arte (7th Art vs ""Cinemas""), reference art attached. The idea is to have 1 screen in some of our high end multiplex cinemas (2 in SD, and 2 in the interior), fully destined to a more upscale cinema program, will be a permanent offer for clients, so they know where to look up for these kind of releases (as per untill today, this is aleatory There is only one cinema/site dedicated to this kind of cinema in the entire country (FineArts), and with this Palacio del 7°Arte, we pretend to have a wider release pattern to be able to open this kind of films, fitting the market reality: would mean to open this kind of films to 4 sites minimum. To push this concept forward, I have booked a “Spanish Film Festival” with the Spanish embassy in RD on October 16th, and a local distributor for films, who holds rights for most Spanish films for Central America (Palmera Films) Never the less, our will is NOT to associate our new brand to Plamera, but best to SONY (Sony Classics) and to premier it before the festival with a Sony film. As per dates, what would best fit the project, is being capable to release WHIPLASH as the opening film for the project, date to date with USA (October the 9th), since it has been awarded in Sundance, Cannes, Toronto, NY and so forth: this is the PERFECT movie for the idea. If we can please release in that date, the movie will be getting a huge publicity and press coverage due to the cinema marketing campaign we are to be pushing for the project. Please confirm if we can open this film in this date. We would be opening in Palacio del Cine BlueMall (the most upgrade mall in the country, who just opened the local Marriot 5* Hotel, and where we have other than a VIP screen, the IMAX) + BellaVista (is an old rich area of the city with moviegoers preference for a more “arty” product) + Palacio Palma Real (is at Bavaro, best known outside as PUNTA CANA: only local millionaires live there + rich foreigners who retire or live in RD… Julio Iglesias type of people, Enrique was there this last week) So PLEASE, can we release WHIPLASH on October 9th at RD?....

I have entered the new release date and the 3 DCPs are ordered.Below is our new US 2014 release date schedule. I have also included my thoughts – please let me know that you think as well!No Good Deed – September 12As of now, I did not plan to release this in Dominican Republic.Not a big release so no problemo if we skip itOK. We will plan on not releasing for now.Fury – October 17We will be releasing in Latin America in January. The producers will like to release during Academy Award period. We just need a 2 week separation from UNBROKEN. Most markets are releasing January 15-29.UNBROKEN opens on January 22nd in RD, due to a local Dominican film release on the 15th ""PAL CAMPAMENTO"" by Roberto Angel who is the most successful local film-maker with 3 years on a row having the top box release of the year + other big local film release on December 25th.We could go for February 5th (2 week separation from Unbroken as requested).Never the less, PLEASE any possible alternative to open BEFORE would be most apreciated: I have proposed November 13th in the attached booking.PD: As mentioned, this market/society is US driven with not so much Latinamerican influence, RD is peculiar in this aspect (they all look forward to USA), and piracy is a huge issue => as soon as a big film is released in USA people know about the movie as per everybody has relatives living in NY/NJ or Miami, so if not available in cinemas, they download it from the net and/or are sold in streets. Anything over 2 months separation from USA release, affects much on boxoffice expectations.For now, let’s date it on February 5. If we release in 2015, I think that is our best weekend. I am going to see if a November release is possible, but it will likely be in the hands of the producers. If they indeed want all Spanish speaking markets to go later, a LAS version may not even be created for a 2014 release. I will let them know our first choice is November and see if it can be achieved.Annie – December 19Releasing in January and February in Latin America during vacationsCan we open on January 1st?Yes, January 1 is approved. I prefer this date too rather than opening against Big Hero 6.The Interview – December 25We can release this later in 2015. It may be a difficult comedy for the region.We can work on a limited release, there are few but good specialized screens for this kind of movies, + we plan on promoting 3 screens within our cinema group specialized for so. Date TBD February 2015Agreed. We will set for TBD February 2015.Foxcatcher/WhiplashThese are small films that we will release limited in November 2014. But if interested, we can release in February near Academy Award nominations.As ""The interview"", this kind of movies will be market in a different way, and with a minimum distribution marketing costs (1 DCP + 10/15 posters). We are interested in this kind of material as per we are going to be promoting this alternative upgrade progarmation for determined sites.BTW Foxcatcher with Channing Tattum + Mark Ruffalo + Steve Carell... small?. We want that movie ;)Agreed on the minimum distribution. We will plan on a release and figure out the final date later in the year. Foxcatcher can be yours, no problem haha. I meant that it may have a more limited audience rather than small – we definitely want to release everywhere we can!Some 2015 dates are being switched so I will send that official schedule in the next few weeks.Gracias!IvanFrom: Rafael.Suarez@palaciodelcine.com.do<mailto:Rafael.Suarez@palaciodelcine.com.do> [mailto:Rafael.Suarez@palaciodelcine.com.do]Sent: Tuesday, August 12, 2014 2:31 PMTo: Valverde, IvanCc: rafaelsuarezbatlle@hotmail.com<mailto:rafaelsuarezbatlle@hotmail.com>Subject: RE: Dominican Republic - Agosto/Septiembre FechasPerfect!

Regarding Blart, the $10 million of spending this year does already reflect a haircut/tighter marketing pattern vs. typical spending for a mid-April release (we would normally assume a $15 – 20 mm hit). While I do not want to say that the number cannot be reduced further, the current anticipated impact is lower that we would normally project, so the savings may be limited. While we discussed it the other day, I also wanted to remind everyone that after covering the Jobs shortfall as discussed below, we will still have a challenge next year which we will need to be diligent in trying to cover to reach target. The impact of the cost of Bond increasing to $260 vs. the $250 we have been looking at is another $2.8 million hit in the year (unless we take the box office target up). I will continue to maintain the impact chart as everything continues to evolve.

He seemed ok with blart back in April 15 (he thinks the hit to fy 15 can be brought down from the estimated 10m due to reduced fy 15 spending) and appreciated the roll through effect of that film plus the W Smith film moving earlier in fy 16 could offset the in year hit on Jobs. So on jobs specifically, when we home in on who the financier(s) will be, pls advise, so we can get at it on that front.

"Pop Culture Update Woody Allen Speaks Out Woody Allen addresses Dylan Farrow's accusation that he molested her as a child. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/woody-allen-speaks-out.html N.F.L. Prospect Michael Sam Proudly Says What Teammates Knew: He's Gay Coaches at the University of Missouri divided players into small groups at a preseason football practice last year for a team-building exercise. One by one, players were asked to talk about themselves — where they grew up, why they chose Missouri and what others might not know about them. As Michael Sam, a defensive lineman, began to speak, he balled up a piece of paper in his hands. “I’m gay,” he said. With that, Mr. Sam set himself on a path to become the first publicly gay player in the National Football League. Now Mr. Sam enters an uncharted area of the sports landscape. He is making his public declaration before he is drafted, to the potential detriment to his professional career. And he is doing so as he prepares to enter a league with an overtly macho culture, where controversies over homophobia have attracted recent attention. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/sports/michael-sam-college-football-star-says-he-is-gay-ahead-of-nfl-draft.html LeanIn.org and Getty Aim to Change Women's Portrayal in Stock Photos There is the businesswoman, wearing a suit and glasses and holding a briefcase. There is the mother, smiling as she pours milk into her children’s cereal bowls at the breakfast table. There is the multitasker, holding a laptop in one hand and a baby in the other. These stock images are familiar to anyone who has seen an advertisement or flipped through a magazine or brochure illustrating working women and families. And their ubiquity is hurting girls and women by feeding into old-fashioned stereotypes, says Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook executive who has become an advocate for women achieving leadership roles. To try to remedy the problem, Ms. Sandberg’s nonprofit organization, LeanIn.org, is to announce on Monday a partnership with Getty Images, one of the biggest providers of stock photography, to offer a special collection of images that it says represent women and families in more empowering ways. “When we see images of women and girls and men, they often fall into the stereotypes that we’re trying to overcome, and you can’t be what you can’t see,” Ms. Sandberg said in an interview. The new library of photos shows professional women as surgeons, painters, bakers, soldiers and hunters. There are girls riding skateboards, women lifting weights and fathers changing babies’ diapers. Women in offices wear contemporary clothes and hairstyles and hold tablets or smartphones — a far cry from the typical stock photos of women in 1980s power suits with a briefcase. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/business/leaninorg-and-getty-aim-to-change-womens-portrayal-in-stock-photos.html Dreamworks Animation Launches Publishing Unit Up to now the studio licensed books based on its characters to different publishers with Simon & Schuster serving as the master licensee.But now it’s taking charge with DreamWorks Press, described as “an in-house operation which will publish digital and print books inspired by the studio’s vast [intellectual property] library.” The unit’s works will be sold and distributed by The Perseus Books Group and will “give fans a meaningful way to interact with us on a year-round basis,” DreamWorks Animation‘s Head of Franchise Shawn Dennis says.

The 22-year-old Olympian had a huge smile after skating on Saturday — until the instant she saw her latest score. A shocked scowl swept across Wagner's face, and she mouthed ""bull s--t"" to one of the teammates seating next to her in the 'kiss and cry' section. Her sudden disgust was captured on camera and quickly became an Internet sensation. The rapid-fire change from radiant to raging became the first meme of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, rivaled only by gymnast’s McKayla Maroney’s “not impressed” face from the 2012 Summer Olympics. “To score that low was very disappointing for me,” a more diplomatic Wagner told reporters later. “But honestly, this was more about me and my performance and proving to everyone I belong here.” http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/u-s-figure-skater-ashley-wagner-latest-impressed-olympian-article-1.1607745 Shia LaBeouf Leaves Press Conference; Reappears at Premiere Wearing Paper Bag Shia LaBeouf's bizarre behavior in Germany over the weekend left some wondering if there is cause for concern. The actor – who's promoting his new film, Nymphomaniac, at the Berlin International Film Festival – arrived sporting a shaved-down tooth and disheveled appearance for the cast panel, answering only one question before quickly exiting the room. When asked how it felt to be in a movie with such explicit sex scenes, LaBeouf took a drink of water and said, ""When the seagulls follow the trawler, it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea."" The actor, 27, then thanked the audience, got up and left. It was a reference to a situation with soccer star Eric Cantona from 1995, in which he spoke the same exact quote prior to walking out of a press conference, according to the Hollywood Reporter. LaBeouf's Nymphomaniac costars, including Uma Thurman and Christian Slater, looked stunned by his sudden departure – although they recovered quickly with a joke. ""Obviously, the script is packed with a lot of sardines,"" deadpanned Slater. ""One sardine after another."" The missing part of LaBeouf's tooth – which he reportedly shaved down in order to better replicate life on the front lines for his role in the upcoming World War II movie Fury – wasn't visible on the red carpet Sunday evening. Although the actor wore a natty suit to the world premiere of his film, he paired it with a cut-out paper bag over his head that read, ""I am not famous anymore,"" a line he has been Tweeting daily since Jan. 13. http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20785224,00.html 'Dumb Starbucks' Coffee Shop Opens in Los Feliz Los Feliz was buzzing Sunday afternoon as crowds of people lined up for hours to grab a cup of coffee from, uh, “Dumb Starbucks.” The mock store, which quietly opened Friday, is nearly identical to a typical Starbucks location, with tumblers for sale and trendy CDs, including ""Dumb Jazz Standards,"" displayed on the counter. But the similarities end there. Drinks here are served in green and white “Dumb Starbucks coffee” cups, while pastries are pulled from display cases straight from their Vons’ packaging. The menu features “Dumb Iced Coffee,” “Dumb Frappuccinos,” and a seasonal “Wuppy Duppy Latte.” But only iced coffees and lattes were available -- for free, to promote the new business, an upbeat barista told customers after apologizing for the wait. “They’re definitely not serving at Starbucks pace,” customer Jeffrey Eyster, 43, joked after waiting about an hour in line. As word of the shop spread on social media, curious customers came to snap selfies in front of the sign or photos of the line wrapped around the small strip mall. Those who cut to avoid a nearly two-hour wait were promptly shamed out of line. http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-dumb-starbucks-parody-coffee-shop-los-feliz-20140209,0,3751296.story?track=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+latimes%2Fmostviewed+(L.A.+Times+-+Most+Viewed+Stories)#axzz2swloIayc Clint Eastwood Saves Man from Choking Hollywood actor Clint Eastwood has been credited with saving the life of a golf tournament director in California who was choking on a piece of cheese.

Greenstein comes from Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Pictures, where he was chief marketing officer since 2011. In his new post he will report to Amy Pascal, Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman. Blake, a well-liked figure in the movie industry, stepped down in August after 22 years with the company. “We are thrilled to welcome Josh to SPE,” Pascal said in a statement. ""He has an impressive and unparalleled track record of success, and we are confident that he will be a valuable addition to our executive team."" Paramount said earlier this week that Greenstein would not renew his contract when it expires later this year. While at Paramount, Greenstein led marketing campaigns for films including Martin Scorsese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" this year's summer hit ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" and the 2013 Brad Pitt zombie film ""World War Z."" Blake's exit followed a series of changes to the studio's executive ranks as it has tried to trim costs over the last year. The studio, a unit of Tokyo-based Sony Corp., laid off Chris Cookson, then president of Sony Pictures Technologies, in January. Dave Bishop, president of Sony Pictures' home entertainment division, left in March. Previous executive changes included the firing of domestic and international marketing head Marc Weinstock and the departure of Steve Elzer, senior vice president of media relations. Films released by Sony Pictures -- which includes Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Sony Pictures Classics and other entities -- have grossed more than $972 million in the U.S. and Canada so far this year. In terms of domestic ticket sales, it ranks fourth among the studios, and its box office is up 19% year to date from the same period in 2013, according to Box Office Mojo. This year Sony's biggest movies include ""The Amazing Spider Man 2"" ($202.8 million domestically) and ""22 Jump Street"" ($190 million in U.S. ticket sales). The company's slate for the rest of the year includes Pitt's World War II movie ""Fury"" and the musical ""Annie."" ""I am excited to join SPE’s Motion Picture Group to create compelling and impactful marketing and distribution campaigns that will reach audiences and help SPE deliver at the global box office,” Greenstein said in a statement. TheWrap: Sony Appoints Josh Greenstein President of Worldwide Marketing and DistributionBy Gina HallSeptember 5, 201 Greenstein will assume the role previously held by Jeff Blake Paramount's Josh Greenstein will join Sony as the studio's president of worldwide marketing and distribution. As previously reported by TheWrap, Greenstein will exit his role at Paramount to assume the role at Sony previously held by Jeff Blake. Greenstein will oversee the day-to-day management of SPE's worldwide theatrical marketing and distribution activities and will report to Amy Pascal. “We seized the opportunity to attract someone of Josh's caliber to lead marketing and distribution for the Motion Picture Group,” said Michael Lynton, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment. “Josh will be instrumental in helping to implement the vision we have for our motion picture business as we utilize cutting edge and innovative approaches to drive audiences to theaters.” In response to Greenstein's departure, Paramount announced three promotions from within its marketing, distribution and advertising teams, elevating home-grown talent to key positions in the organization under studio vice chairman Rob Moore. Megan Colligan has been promoted to president of worldwide distribution and marketing, overseeing distribution and marketing for Paramount's theatrical and home media groups and continuing to report to Rob Moore. Erik Counter has been promoted to president of worldwide creative advertising, and will now report to Moore. Steve Siskind has been promoted to President, Domestic Marketing, and will report to Colligan. Josh Greenstein, who has served as Paramount's CMO since 2011, had been in negotiations to re-up at Paramount but did an about-face in recent weeks and opted to head across town to the Culver City studio. UPDATED: Variety: Sony Confirms Josh Greenstein to Head MarketingBy Dave McNarySeptember 5, 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment has hired Josh Greenstein as the studio’s president of worldwide marketing and distribution. Greenstein will assume the role previously held by Jeff Blake, who was forced out in late July, and oversee the day-to-day management. He will report to Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment and chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group. Friday’s announcement came three days after Variety reported that Greenstein, the former Paramount Pictures chief marketing officer, was in final negotiations with Sony to succeed Blake. Greenstein, who has been at Paramount since 2005 and previously served as co-president of marketing and executive vice president of creative advertising, had already informed his bosses at the Viacom Inc.-owned studio that he would not be renewing his contract when it expires at the end of this year. Before joining Paramount, he served as head of marketing for Dimension Films. “We seized the opportunity to attract someone of Josh’s caliber to lead marketing and distribution for the Motion Picture Group,” said Michael Lynton, Chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment. “Josh will be instrumental in helping to implement the vision we have for our motion picture business as we utilize cutting edge and innovative approaches to drive audiences to theaters.” Pascal added, “We are thrilled to welcome Josh to SPE. He has an impressive and unparalleled track record of success, and we are confident that he will be a valuable addition to our executive team.” The hire of Greenstein comes with Sony Pictures Entertainment under scrutiny following a mixed performance in 2013 and so far in 2014. The studio saw strong performances from “22 Jump Street” and “Heaven Is for Real” and its franchise “The Amazing Spider-Man 2″ delivered over $700 million worldwide. “RoboCop,” shared with MGM, performed far better overseas ($184 million) than domestically ($58 million) and “The Monuments Men” turned in a middling performance with $155 million worldwide. “Sex Tape” and “Moms Night Out” were disappointments and fell short of expectations. Sony’s Screen Gems unit has generated respectable business this year with “Think Like a Man Too” while “About Last Night” and “When the Game Stands Talls” turned in moderate showings and “Deliver Us From Evil” fell short. The studio has also been cutting back starting in November when Lynton disclosed that the studio had launched “a shift in emphasis from motion pictures to television production” along with a focus on cost-containment. Pascal announced late last year the studio would reduce its film output to “closer to 18″ movies per year going forward, from the “low 20s” in recent years. Sony Entertainment has been pressured since last year by Third Point’s Daniel Loeb, a major shareholder with about 7% of the company. Loeb has criticized the studio for lagging behind competitors in profitability. THR: Josh Greenstein Joins Sony as President of Worldwide Marketing and DistributionBy Rebecca Ford09/05/2014 He assumes the role previously held by Jeff Blake. Sony has hired former Paramount exec Josh Greenstein as president of worldwide marketing and distribution, the role previously held by Jeff Blake.He'll oversee the day-to-day management of SPE’s worldwide theatrical marketing and distribution activities.Greenstein most recently worked as chief marketing officer for Paramount Pictures and earlier served as co-president of marketing. Prior to those roles, he was executive vp of creative advertising. And before joining Paramount, he served as head of marketing for Dimension Films.“I am looking forward to working with the many talented people at SPE. I would like to thank Brad Grey and Rob Moore for the incredible opportunities and leadership they provided me while working for them over the last nine years at Paramount,” said Greenstein in a statement. “Looking ahead, I am excited to join SPE’s Motion Picture Group to create compelling and impactful marketing and distribution campaigns that will reach audiences and help SPE deliver at the global box office.”Greenstein's work on Paramount included leading the marketing campaigns for The Wolf of Wall Street, World War Z, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, Flight, Star Trek Into Darkness, Paranormal Activity, True Grit, The Fighter and Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.“We seized the opportunity to attract someone of Josh’s caliber to lead marketing and distribution for the Motion Picture Group,” said Michael Lynton, chairman and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, in a statement. “Josh will be instrumental in helping to implement the vision we have for our motion picture business as we utilize cutting edge and innovative approaches to drive audiences to theaters.”Blake exited the position in July after 22 years with the studio. The move, which had been rumored for several months, left the studio without a head for its worldwide marketing and distribution. Sony’s worldwide distribution head Rory Bruer took over Blake's duties on the distribution front in the interim, while marketing chief Dwight Caines handled Blake's marketing domain.",Private

Some thoughts in response to John's questions: Tom mentioned $70k but that was for just one aspect of what we need from Keystone to support the AG project. That is why we stopped the discussion and said we’d think about it and send something afterwards – so we would not just give off the cuff or piecemeal budget numbers. This proposal is not the the absolute minimum we need to keep the AG program alive. It responds to the views expressed that we should identify what we need to get the most of the AG program, to reasonably maximize its effectiveness and chance of success. The difference between the minimum we need just to keep the AG effort alive and what we have proposed, is probably $200k or so in Keystone, most of the communications budget, and a small part of the outside counsel fees. But, that would meaningfully diminish the chances of success in the AG program. There is only so far we can get with the AG’s unless we develop better evidence and intelligence against Goliath, and that is the budget for Keystone. No, we do not need to make any decisions on year two now. We can see how this progresses. Again, to take this through and have a reasonable chance of success, we probably would need to continue through year two, and wanted to give you a sense of the likely budget. We can, however, take that up next year. We do, however, have to be careful (in terms of AG relations) about walking the AG’s down a road based on our assistance if we do not plan on continuing the assistance to conclusion. We can have Jenner prepare a sub-budget for their portion. There was more detail in the fuller memo, but I’ll ask Tom to put together a proper budget. I don’t have a lot of visibility into line items on DCA’s budget. I’ll try to get more info. And we can have the broader DCA discussion. I will ask my EA to try to schedule a call for the first week in April. If that doesn’t work, we can take this up at the next GC meeting, which I believe is scheduled for the end of the week of April 7th. SBF ————————————————————— Steven B.

May be worth reconvening by phone to discuss but will await reactions from others. First of all, not sure I’m understanding the overall approach. I thought that at the end of the GC meeting, the consensus of the group was that we should deal with the immediate need to help the AGs. We recall that Tom P. threw out a number like 70K for a “basic” analysis by Keystone of Goliath operations. The idea was to see what would be truly required to give the AGs what they need to build their arguments. All longer-term outlays were to be discussed further because we’re still digesting the larger Goliath proposal and undecided about its scope. Second, not sure I’m following the actual numbers proposed. The current proposal of $400K for the first year is nearly as large as the original proposal of $500K for the first year. Why? And do we really have to approve another $300K for a second year at this time? As to Jenner’s 650K, don’t we need a sub-budget to explain? May well be worth it, but how can we tell? They list tasks, but not at least rough estimated numbers. Also, how does this requested ask relate to the increase of $70K per studio for DCA, to account for increased work/communications/PR for State AG project. Third, I’d like to discuss DCA. There are benefits to how they are set up and operate that I would want to make sure we are not inadvertently undermining. DCA’s effectiveness has been driven in part by its ability to be nimble and aggressive, and broaden the membership base w/ non-studio support. Thanks.

In short, this is a strategy based on supporting and strengthening the ongoing State AG effort, as was discussed at the last GC meeting. This strategy is a subset of the larger Goliath strategy presented at the GC meeting and, in order to keep the attached digestible, assumes familiarity with the larger Goliath strategy document. Because the AG effort is ongoing, and at a sensitive time, we request your approval by Monday, March 31st. If you have questions, of course, do not hesitate to call. Likewise, although I did not think another group discussion was necessary, if any of you do, I will schedule a call. There are two related issues to clarify. The first concerns how we will pay for this; the second concerns the relationship between this proposal/budget and the DCA budget. How will we pay for the proposed Goliath strategy? Importantly, and I may not have made this clear at the GC meeting, this recommendation does not come with a “call” for additional funds. At this time, we are going to fund the expanded AG program out of the Legal Trust. It is the nature of the Legal Trust that there are funds earmarked for matters that never materialize and/or that take on a lower priority in light of emerging needs. Here, the 2014 Legal Trust budget has $1 million earmarked for Hotfile. Obviously, the Hotfile case has concluded; there are some modest legal activities (responding to EFF motions to unseal the record, for example). But, in large part, that money earmarked for Hotfile will not be spent on Hotfile. We would thus divert that money to partially/mostly cover the cost of the expanded AG effort. That said, the AG effort is a substantial effort that requires substantial resources that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust. There are also several other initiatives we are working on that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust (e.g., the ISP Measures/512(j) project, a broad based advertising strategy, a global cyberlocker strategy, the renewed Xunlei negotiations, and others); and there are certain initiatives that we are engaging in at a more substantial level than budgeted (e.g., the major UK site blocking initiative). If each of these initiatives moves forward to the implementation stage in 2014 – which should be what we all seek – there will be a strain on the Legal Trust and we very well may end up coming back to you with a call for additional Legal Trust funds towards the latter part of the year. In that sense, everything we do (whether we are calling for funds or not) should be assessed in terms of its value relative to budget and other priorities. We believe the current Goliath proposal and recommendation meets that test. How does this relate to the general DCA budget or other requests for funding from DCA? I cannot yet profess to be the expert on the DCA or its budget. However, I can report that the present Goliath proposal is not overlapping with DCA activities or budgets. It is complementary and will be coordinated with DCA’s own activities. DCA does some anti-Goliath public advocacy. The existing AG effort has been loosely coordinated with DCA Attachments: image001.png (10464 Bytes)",Private

We can have Jenner prepare a sub-budget for their portion. There was more detail in the fuller memo, but I’ll ask Tom to put together a proper budget. I don’t have a lot of visibility into line items on DCA’s budget. I’ll try to get more info. And we can have the broader DCA discussion. I will ask my EA to try to schedule a call for the first week in April. If that doesn’t work, we can take this up at the next GC meeting, which I believe is scheduled for the end of the week of April 7th. SBF ————————————————————— Steven B.

May be worth reconvening by phone to discuss but will await reactions from others. First of all, not sure I’m understanding the overall approach. I thought that at the end of the GC meeting, the consensus of the group was that we should deal with the immediate need to help the AGs. We recall that Tom P. threw out a number like 70K for a “basic” analysis by Keystone of Goliath operations. The idea was to see what would be truly required to give the AGs what they need to build their arguments. All longer-term outlays were to be discussed further because we’re still digesting the larger Goliath proposal and undecided about its scope. Second, not sure I’m following the actual numbers proposed. The current proposal of $400K for the first year is nearly as large as the original proposal of $500K for the first year. Why? And do we really have to approve another $300K for a second year at this time? As to Jenner’s 650K, don’t we need a sub-budget to explain? May well be worth it, but how can we tell? They list tasks, but not at least rough estimated numbers. Also, how does this requested ask relate to the increase of $70K per studio for DCA, to account for increased work/communications/PR for State AG project. Third, I’d like to discuss DCA. There are benefits to how they are set up and operate that I would want to make sure we are not inadvertently undermining. DCA’s effectiveness has been driven in part by its ability to be nimble and aggressive, and broaden the membership base w/ non-studio support. Thanks.

In short, this is a strategy based on supporting and strengthening the ongoing State AG effort, as was discussed at the last GC meeting. This strategy is a subset of the larger Goliath strategy presented at the GC meeting and, in order to keep the attached digestible, assumes familiarity with the larger Goliath strategy document. Because the AG effort is ongoing, and at a sensitive time, we request your approval by Monday, March 31st. If you have questions, of course, do not hesitate to call. Likewise, although I did not think another group discussion was necessary, if any of you do, I will schedule a call. There are two related issues to clarify. The first concerns how we will pay for this; the second concerns the relationship between this proposal/budget and the DCA budget. How will we pay for the proposed Goliath strategy? Importantly, and I may not have made this clear at the GC meeting, this recommendation does not come with a “call” for additional funds. At this time, we are going to fund the expanded AG program out of the Legal Trust. It is the nature of the Legal Trust that there are funds earmarked for matters that never materialize and/or that take on a lower priority in light of emerging needs. Here, the 2014 Legal Trust budget has $1 million earmarked for Hotfile. Obviously, the Hotfile case has concluded; there are some modest legal activities (responding to EFF motions to unseal the record, for example). But, in large part, that money earmarked for Hotfile will not be spent on Hotfile. We would thus divert that money to partially/mostly cover the cost of the expanded AG effort. That said, the AG effort is a substantial effort that requires substantial resources that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust. There are also several other initiatives we are working on that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust (e.g., the ISP Measures/512(j) project, a broad based advertising strategy, a global cyberlocker strategy, the renewed Xunlei negotiations, and others); and there are certain initiatives that we are engaging in at a more substantial level than budgeted (e.g., the major UK site blocking initiative). If each of these initiatives moves forward to the implementation stage in 2014 – which should be what we all seek – there will be a strain on the Legal Trust and we very well may end up coming back to you with a call for additional Legal Trust funds towards the latter part of the year. In that sense, everything we do (whether we are calling for funds or not) should be assessed in terms of its value relative to budget and other priorities. We believe the current Goliath proposal and recommendation meets that test. How does this relate to the general DCA budget or other requests for funding from DCA? I cannot yet profess to be the expert on the DCA or its budget. However, I can report that the present Goliath proposal is not overlapping with DCA activities or budgets. It is complementary and will be coordinated with DCA’s own activities. DCA does some anti-Goliath public advocacy.

Some thoughts in response to John's questions: Tom mentioned $70k but that was for just one aspect of what we need from Keystone to support the AG project. That is why we stopped the discussion and said we’d think about it and send something afterwards – so we would not just give off the cuff or piecemeal budget numbers. This proposal is not the the absolute minimum we need to keep the AG program alive. It responds to the views expressed that we should identify what we need to get the most of the AG program, to reasonably maximize its effectiveness and chance of success. The difference between the minimum we need just to keep the AG effort alive and what we have proposed, is probably $200k or so in Keystone, most of the communications budget, and a small part of the outside counsel fees. But, that would meaningfully diminish the chances of success in the AG program. There is only so far we can get with the AG’s unless we develop better evidence and intelligence against Goliath, and that is the budget for Keystone. No, we do not need to make any decisions on year two now. We can see how this progresses. Again, to take this through and have a reasonable chance of success, we probably would need to continue through year two, and wanted to give you a sense of the likely budget. We can, however, take that up next year. We do, however, have to be careful (in terms of AG relations) about walking the AG’s down a road based on our assistance if we do not plan on continuing the assistance to conclusion. We can have Jenner prepare a sub-budget for their portion. There was more detail in the fuller memo, but I’ll ask Tom to put together a proper budget.

"Re: Goliath - Materials for May 9 Call - PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL ** Deleted Perrelli from the thread ** John – This responds to your question about the amounts we’ve spent to date on the state AG project. There are two general sets of activities: (1) There are the Jenner fees in generally engaging with the state AG’s. This is the “cap” work. (2) There has also been some specific state law research outside the cap, based on AG requests for research analyses of potential legal claims to support the CIDs. We’ve also obviously incurred fees in a third category related to the development of the Goliath plans/proposals and the analyses in support of them, but I take that as outside your question. CAP ACTIVITIES – GENERALLY, SUPPORTING AND ENGAGING WITH STATE AG’s This has, to date, come out of the Policy Department budget. In 2013, the total on this was about $60k. To date in 2014, the total on this has been about $30k. If you are looking at these numbers to benchmark fees going forward, the 2014 numbers come with a very significant caveat: Perrelli has been actually accruing legal fees well in excess of the monthly cap (double and triple the cap). He’s been a pretty good sport about it, but expects to be paid more in line with his actual work as the requests from the state AG’s ramp up. Perrelli has been accruing $15-20k a month in slower months and up to $30-40k a month for some of the heavier months, particularly more recently. We expect the AG demands for support to increase. My plan is to talk with Perrelli about continuing under a cap (albeit at a substantially higher level), so we can have cost certainty to stay at the budget we’ve presented to you. He has expressed a willingness to consider doing so. We do not anticipate continuing to pull from the Policy Department budget going forward. They were not budgeted for the increased level of activity. Going forward, as the proposal explains, we will fund the state AG project out of the Legal Trust. NON-CAP RESEARCH This has been paid out of the Legal Trust. To date, the total for this specific research has been about $37k. Going forward we intend to combine all these into one matter funded out of the Legal Trust. Please keep in mind that there may be an “in progress” invoice or two that has not been captured. However, this is a good general sense of the spend to date. Hopefully, this answers your question but, if not, just let me know. I look forward to speaking with everyone in a few hours.

We have thought through two different resource levels for the AG project. Option 1 would provide the level of resources necessary to keep the AG project going on its current course. We have had success to date in motivating the AG’s; however, as they approach the CID phase, the AG’s will need greater levels of legal support. Thus, Option 1 focuses largely on direct Jenner legal support for the AG’s litigation-related activities. It also includes some modest resources devoted to communications (a) to support the AG’s and (b) to amplify our message about Goliath. Specifically, the budget for Option 1 consists of: Jenner ($500k) Legal research/analysis re possible AG claims Draft CIDs and motions/pleadings in support of CIDs and other litigation re AG claims Legal advice and counsel to AG’s Assistance with review of documents produced pursuant to CIDs Generally, assist AG’s with substance of issues Comms ($85k) Direct media support to AG’S re CIDs and litigation/enforcement actions Respond to/rebut Goliath’s public advocacy Amplify negative Goliath news Seed media stories based on investigation and AG actions The total Option 1 budget for year one is $585,000. Given where we are in the year, we anticipate the remaining 2014 budget to be between $300-400k. Option 2 would provide the level of resources necessary to potentially increase the impact of the AG effort. As explained in the attached document, creating an environment to potentially increase the impact of the AG effort requires additional resources devoted to investigation and analysis of Goliath. This investigation and analysis would give the AG’s a greater understanding of the problems created by Goliath (ammunition/evidence against Goliath), and the technical solutions for those problems. In large part, the difference between Options 1 and 2 is Keystone (and the related Jenner activities related to working with Keystone). Included in the attachment to this email is a document prepared by Keystone laying out in some detail the nature of the services they would be providing and the specific issues and information gaps those services address. The budget for Option 2 is the same as the budget previously presented, except that we have eliminated the funds earmarked for a potential documentary based on the feedback from the group. Specifically, the budget for Option 2 consists of: Investigation and Analysis Keystone: See attached document ($340k) Jenner: Work with Keystone to develop analyses and evidence, and package evidence for advocacy ($150k) AG Support Jenner ($500k) Legal research/analysis re possible AG claims Draft CIDs and motions/pleadings in support of CIDs and other litigation re AG claims Legal advice and counsel to AG’s Assistance with review of documents produced pursuant to CIDs Generally, assist AG’s with substance of issues Hemu ($60k) Long-time trusted AG advisor who AG’s want as resource Assist AG’s to understand/assimilate evidence and claims Vet/vouch for our work product Public spokesperson for AG’s as needed Direct media support for AG’s CID and litigation/enforcement actions ($25k) Public Advocacy ($100k) Respond to/rebut Goliath’s public advocacy Amplify negative Goliath news Seed media stories based on investigation and AG actions Limited survey research to identify effective public messaging The total Option 2 Budget for year one is $1,175,000. As some of the Keystone work would be front loaded, we would expect the remaining 2014 budget to be between $750-850k. We would endeavor to fund either Option from the existing Trust budget and are not now requesting additional funds to cover the AG project. Nevertheless, the AG project is outside the existing budget and, depending on other priorities and projects approved, we may need to seek additional funds for the Trust at a later date. We would request that each company be prepared to give your approval for either Option 1 or Option 2 on Friday’s call.

May be worth reconvening by phone to discuss but will await reactions from others. First of all, not sure I’m understanding the overall approach. I thought that at the end of the GC meeting, the consensus of the group was that we should deal with the immediate need to help the AGs. We recall that Tom P. threw out a number like 70K for a “basic” analysis by Keystone of Goliath operations. The idea was to see what would be truly required to give the AGs what they need to build their arguments. All longer-term outlays were to be discussed further because we’re still digesting the larger Goliath proposal and undecided about its scope. Second, not sure I’m following the actual numbers proposed. The current proposal of $400K for the first year is nearly as large as the original proposal of $500K for the first year. Why? And do we really have to approve another $300K for a second year at this time? As to Jenner’s 650K, don’t we need a sub-budget to explain? May well be worth it, but how can we tell? They list tasks, but not at least rough estimated numbers. Also, how does this requested ask relate to the increase of $70K per studio for DCA, to account for increased work/communications/PR for State AG project. Third, I’d like to discuss DCA. There are benefits to how they are set up and operate that I would want to make sure we are not inadvertently undermining. DCA’s effectiveness has been driven in part by its ability to be nimble and aggressive, and broaden the membership base w/ non-studio support. Thanks.

In short, this is a strategy based on supporting and strengthening the ongoing State AG effort, as was discussed at the last GC meeting. This strategy is a subset of the larger Goliath strategy presented at the GC meeting and, in order to keep the attached digestible, assumes familiarity with the larger Goliath strategy document. Because the AG effort is ongoing, and at a sensitive time, we request your approval by Monday, March 31st. If you have questions, of course, do not hesitate to call. Likewise, although I did not think another group discussion was necessary, if any of you do, I will schedule a call. There are two related issues to clarify. The first concerns how we will pay for this; the second concerns the relationship between this proposal/budget and the DCA budget. How will we pay for the proposed Goliath strategy? Importantly, and I may not have made this clear at the GC meeting, this recommendation does not come with a “call” for additional funds. At this time, we are going to fund the expanded AG program out of the Legal Trust. It is the nature of the Legal Trust that there are funds earmarked for matters that never materialize and/or that take on a lower priority in light of emerging needs. Here, the 2014 Legal Trust budget has $1 million earmarked for Hotfile. Obviously, the Hotfile case has concluded; there are some modest legal activities (responding to EFF motions to unseal the record, for example). But, in large part, that money earmarked for Hotfile will not be spent on Hotfile. We would thus divert that money to partially/mostly cover the cost of the expanded AG effort. That said, the AG effort is a substantial effort that requires substantial resources that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust. There are also several other initiatives we are working on that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust (e.g., the ISP Measures/512(j) project, a broad based advertising strategy, a global cyberlocker strategy, the renewed Xunlei negotiations, and others); and there are certain initiatives that we are engaging in at a more substantial level than budgeted (e.g., the major UK site blocking initiative). If each of these initiatives moves forward to the implementation stage in 2014 – which should be what we all seek – there will be a strain on the Legal Trust and we very well may end up coming back to you with a call for additional Legal Trust funds towards the latter part of the year. In that sense, everything we do (whether we are calling for funds or not) should be assessed in terms of its value relative to budget and other priorities. We believe the current Goliath proposal and recommendation meets that test. How does this relate to the general DCA budget or other requests for funding from DCA? I cannot yet profess to be the expert on the DCA or its budget. However, I can report that the present Goliath proposal is not overlapping with DCA activities or budgets. It is complementary and will be coordinated with DCA’s own activities. DCA does some anti-Goliath public advocacy. The existing AG effort has been loosely coordinated with DCA. In that regard, DCA does some fact gathering, but typically at a fairly superficial level – not at the level we need for the State AG’s. DCA also does a lot of other advocacy on piracy and related digital issues – i.e., public advocacy not related to Goliath at all.

Some thoughts in response to John's questions: Tom mentioned $70k but that was for just one aspect of what we need from Keystone to support the AG project. That is why we stopped the discussion and said we’d think about it and send something afterwards – so we would not just give off the cuff or piecemeal budget numbers. This proposal is not the the absolute minimum we need to keep the AG program alive. It responds to the views expressed that we should identify what we need to get the most of the AG program, to reasonably maximize its effectiveness and chance of success. The difference between the minimum we need just to keep the AG effort alive and what we have proposed, is probably $200k or so in Keystone, most of the communications budget, and a small part of the outside counsel fees. But, that would meaningfully diminish the chances of success in the AG program. There is only so far we can get with the AG’s unless we develop better evidence and intelligence against Goliath, and that is the budget for Keystone. No, we do not need to make any decisions on year two now. We can see how this progresses. Again, to take this through and have a reasonable chance of success, we probably would need to continue through year two, and wanted to give you a sense of the likely budget. We can, however, take that up next year. We do, however, have to be careful (in terms of AG relations) about walking the AG’s down a road based on our assistance if we do not plan on continuing the assistance to conclusion. We can have Jenner prepare a sub-budget for their portion. There was more detail in the fuller memo, but I’ll ask Tom to put together a proper budget. I don’t have a lot of visibility into line items on DCA’s budget. I’ll try to get more info. And we can have the broader DCA discussion.

I will ask my EA to try to schedule a call for the first week in April.

May be worth reconvening by phone to discuss but will await reactions from others. First of all, not sure I’m understanding the overall approach. I thought that at the end of the GC meeting, the consensus of the group was that we should deal with the immediate need to help the AGs. We recall that Tom P. threw out a number like 70K for a “basic” analysis by Keystone of Goliath operations. The idea was to see what would be truly required to give the AGs what they need to build their arguments. All longer-term outlays were to be discussed further because we’re still digesting the larger Goliath proposal and undecided about its scope. Second, not sure I’m following the actual numbers proposed. The current proposal of $400K for the first year is nearly as large as the original proposal of $500K for the first year. Why? And do we really have to approve another $300K for a second year at this time? As to Jenner’s 650K, don’t we need a sub-budget to explain? May well be worth it, but how can we tell? They list tasks, but not at least rough estimated numbers. Also, how does this requested ask relate to the increase of $70K per studio for DCA, to account for increased work/communications/PR for State AG project. Third, I’d like to discuss DCA. There are benefits to how they are set up and operate that I would want to make sure we are not inadvertently undermining. DCA’s effectiveness has been driven in part by its ability to be nimble and aggressive, and broaden the membership base w/ non-studio support. Thanks.

In short, this is a strategy based on supporting and strengthening the ongoing State AG effort, as was discussed at the last GC meeting. This strategy is a subset of the larger Goliath strategy presented at the GC meeting and, in order to keep the attached digestible, assumes familiarity with the larger Goliath strategy document. Because the AG effort is ongoing, and at a sensitive time, we request your approval by Monday, March 31st. If you have questions, of course, do not hesitate to call. Likewise, although I did not think another group discussion was necessary, if any of you do, I will schedule a call. There are two related issues to clarify. The first concerns how we will pay for this; the second concerns the relationship between this proposal/budget and the DCA budget. How will we pay for the proposed Goliath strategy? Importantly, and I may not have made this clear at the GC meeting, this recommendation does not come with a “call” for additional funds. At this time, we are going to fund the expanded AG program out of the Legal Trust. It is the nature of the Legal Trust that there are funds earmarked for matters that never materialize and/or that take on a lower priority in light of emerging needs. Here, the 2014 Legal Trust budget has $1 million earmarked for Hotfile. Obviously, the Hotfile case has concluded; there are some modest legal activities (responding to EFF motions to unseal the record, for example). But, in large part, that money earmarked for Hotfile will not be spent on Hotfile. We would thus divert that money to partially/mostly cover the cost of the expanded AG effort. That said, the AG effort is a substantial effort that requires substantial resources that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust. There are also several other initiatives we are working on that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust (e.g., the ISP Measures/512(j) project, a broad based advertising strategy, a global cyberlocker strategy, the renewed Xunlei negotiations, and others); and there are certain initiatives that we are engaging in at a more substantial level than budgeted (e.g., the major UK site blocking initiative). If each of these initiatives moves forward to the implementation stage in 2014 – which should be what we all seek – there will be a strain on the Legal Trust and we very well may end up coming back to you with a call for additional Legal Trust funds towards the latter part of the year. In that sense, everything we do (whether we are calling for funds or not) should be assessed in terms of its value relative to budget and other priorities. We believe the current Goliath proposal and recommendation meets that test. How does this relate to the general DCA budget or other requests for funding from DCA? I cannot yet profess to be the expert on the DCA or its budget. However, I can report that the present Goliath proposal is not overlapping with DCA activities or budgets. It is complementary and will be coordinated with DCA’s own activities. DCA does some anti-Goliath public advocacy. The existing AG effort has been loosely coordinated with DCA. In that regard, DCA does some fact gathering, but typically at a fairly superficial level – not at the level we need for the State AG’s. DCA also does a lot of other advocacy on piracy and related digital issues – i.e., public advocacy not related to Goliath at a Attachments: FB2708EC-3ACE-4D24-80C6-88C48D256505[16].png (10439 Bytes) image001.png (10438 Bytes) FB2708EC-3ACE-4D24-80C6-88C48D256505[151].png (10438 Bytes) Goliath - MPAA DCA Budgets - Overview (Final 4.25.14).pdf (327365 Bytes) Jenner Goliath Budget (Y1 Final).pdf (82063 Bytes) Digital Citizens Budget (10234 Bytes) Proposal for Supporting State AG Effort - PRIVILEGED (Final 3.21.14).pdf (80637 Bytes)",Private

Some thoughts in response to John's questions: Tom mentioned $70k but that was for just one aspect of what we need from Keystone to support the AG project. That is why we stopped the discussion and said we’d think about it and send something afterwards – so we would not just give off the cuff or piecemeal budget numbers. This proposal is not the the absolute minimum we need to keep the AG program alive. It responds to the views expressed that we should identify what we need to get the most of the AG program, to reasonably maximize its effectiveness and chance of success. The difference between the minimum we need just to keep the AG effort alive and what we have proposed, is probably $200k or so in Keystone, most of the communications budget, and a small part of the outside counsel fees. But, that would meaningfully diminish the chances of success in the AG program. There is only so far we can get with the AG’s unless we develop better evidence and intelligence against Goliath, and that is the budget for Keystone. No, we do not need to make any decisions on year two now. We can see how this progresses. Again, to take this through and have a reasonable chance of success, we probably would need to continue through year two, and wanted to give you a sense of the likely budget. We can, however, take that up next year. We do, however, have to be careful (in terms of AG relations) about walking the AG’s down a road based on our assistance if we do not plan on continuing the assistance to conclusion. We can have Jenner prepare a sub-budget for their portion. There was more detail in the fuller memo, but I’ll ask Tom to put together a proper budget.

There are also several other initiatives we are working on that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust (e.g., the ISP Measures/512(j) project, a broad based advertising strategy, a global cyberlocker strategy, the renewed Xunlei negotiations, and others); and there are certain initiatives that we are engaging in at a more substantial level than budgeted (e.g., the major UK site blocking initiative). If each of these initiatives moves forward to the implementation stage in 2014 – which should be what we all seek – there will be a strain on the Legal Trust and we very well may end up coming back to you with a call for additional Legal Trust funds towards the latter part of the year. In that sense, everything we do (whether we are calling for funds or not) should be assessed in terms of its value relative to budget and other priorities. We believe the current Goliath proposal and recommendation meets that test. How does this relate to the general DCA budget or other requests for funding from DCA? I cannot yet profess to be the expert on the DCA or its budget. However, I can report that the present Goliath proposal is not overlapping with DCA activities or budgets. It is complementary and will be coordinated with DCA’s own activities. DCA does some anti-Goliath public advocacy. The existing AG effort has been loosely coordinated with DCA. In that regard, DCA does some fact gathering, but typically at a fairly superficial level – not at the level we need for the State AG’s. DCA also does a lot of other advocacy on piracy and related digital issues – i.e., public advocacy not related to Goliath at all. In connection with the bolstered State AG effort, we intend to take more of a leading role in directing DCA’s anti-Goliath efforts, to ensure DCA’s own activities support our activities. We also intend to use DCA as one of the primary public advocacy platforms for the anti-Goliath information and evidence we deve Attachments: FB2708EC-3ACE-4D24-80C6-88C48D256505[151].png (10439 Bytes) image001.png (10438 Bytes)",Private

We have thought through two different resource levels for the AG project. Option 1 would provide the level of resources necessary to keep the AG project going on its current course. We have had success to date in motivating the AG’s; however, as they approach the CID phase, the AG’s will need greater levels of legal support. Thus, Option 1 focuses largely on direct Jenner legal support for the AG’s litigation-related activities. It also includes some modest resources devoted to communications (a) to support the AG’s and (b) to amplify our message about Goliath. Specifically, the budget for Option 1 consists of: Jenner ($500k) Legal research/analysis re possible AG claims Draft CIDs and motions/pleadings in support of CIDs and other litigation re AG claims Legal advice and counsel to AG’s Assistance with review of documents produced pursuant to CIDs Generally, assist AG’s with substance of issues Comms ($85k) Direct media support to AG’S re CIDs and litigation/enforcement actions Respond to/rebut Goliath’s public advocacy Amplify negative Goliath news Seed media stories based on investigation and AG actions The total Option 1 budget for year one is $585,000. Given where we are in the year, we anticipate the remaining 2014 budget to be between $300-400k. Option 2 would provide the level of resources necessary to potentially increase the impact of the AG effort. As explained in the attached document, creating an environment to potentially increase the impact of the AG effort requires additional resources devoted to investigation and analysis of Goliath. This investigation and analysis would give the AG’s a greater understanding of the problems created by Goliath (ammunition/evidence against Goliath), and the technical solutions for those problems. In large part, the difference between Options 1 and 2 is Keystone (and the related Jenner activities related to working with Keystone). Included in the attachment to this email is a document prepared by Keystone laying out in some detail the nature of the services they would be providing and the specific issues and information gaps those services address. The budget for Option 2 is the same as the budget previously presented, except that we have eliminated the funds earmarked for a potential documentary based on the feedback from the group. Specifically, the budget for Option 2 consists of: Investigation and Analysis Keystone: See attached document ($340k) Jenner: Work with Keystone to develop analyses and evidence, and package evidence for advocacy ($150k) AG Support Jenner ($500k) Legal research/analysis re possible AG claims Draft CIDs and motions/pleadings in support of CIDs and other litigation re AG claims Legal advice and counsel to AG’s Assistance with review of documents produced pursuant to CIDs Generally, assist AG’s with substance of issues Hemu ($60k) Long-time trusted AG advisor who AG’s want as resource Assist AG’s to understand/assimilate evidence and claims Vet/vouch for our work product Public spokesperson for AG’s as needed Direct media support for AG’s CID and litigation/enforcement actions ($25k) Public Advocacy ($100k) Respond to/rebut Goliath’s public advocacy Amplify negative Goliath news Seed media stories based on investigation and AG actions Limited survey research to identify effective public messaging The total Option 2 Budget for year one is $1,175,000. As some of the Keystone work would be front loaded, we would expect the remaining 2014 budget to be between $750-850k. We would endeavor to fund either Option from the existing Trust budget and are not now requesting additional funds to cover the AG project. Nevertheless, the AG project is outside the existing budget and, depending on other priorities and projects approved, we may need to seek additional funds for the Trust at a later date. We would request that each company be prepared to give your approval for either Option 1 or Option 2 on Friday’s call.

Some thoughts in response to John's questions: Tom mentioned $70k but that was for just one aspect of what we need from Keystone to support the AG project. That is why we stopped the discussion and said we’d think about it and send something afterwards – so we would not just give off the cuff or piecemeal budget numbers. This proposal is not the the absolute minimum we need to keep the AG program alive. It responds to the views expressed that we should identify what we need to get the most of the AG program, to reasonably maximize its effectiveness and chance of success. The difference between the minimum we need just to keep the AG effort alive and what we have proposed, is probably $200k or so in Keystone, most of the communications budget, and a small part of the outside counsel fees. But, that would meaningfully diminish the chances of success in the AG program. There is only so far we can get with the AG’s unless we develop better evidence and intelligence against Goliath, and that is the budget for Keystone. No, we do not need to make any decisions on year two now. We can see how this progresses. Again, to take this through and have a reasonable chance of success, we probably would need to continue through year two, and wanted to give you a sense of the likely budget. We can, however, take that up next year. We do, however, have to be careful (in terms of AG relations) about walking the AG’s down a road based on our assistance if we do not plan on continuing the assistance to conclusion. We can have Jenner prepare a sub-budget for their portion. There was more detail in the fuller memo, but I’ll ask Tom to put together a proper budget. I don’t have a lot of visibility into line items on DCA’s budget. I’ll try to get more info. And we can have the broader DCA discussion. I will ask my EA to try to schedule a call for the first week in April. If that doesn’t work, we can take this up at the next GC meeting, which I believe is scheduled for the end of the week of April 7th. SBF ————————————————————— Steven B.

May be worth reconvening by phone to discuss but will await reactions from others. First of all, not sure I’m understanding the overall approach. I thought that at the end of the GC meeting, the consensus of the group was that we should deal with the immediate need to help the AGs. We recall that Tom P. threw out a number like 70K for a “basic” analysis by Keystone of Goliath operations. The idea was to see what would be truly required to give the AGs what they need to build their arguments. All longer-term outlays were to be discussed further because we’re still digesting the larger Goliath proposal and undecided about its scope. Second, not sure I’m following the actual numbers proposed. The current proposal of $400K for the first year is nearly as large as the original proposal of $500K for the first year. Why? And do we really have to approve another $300K for a second year at this time? As to Jenner’s 650K, don’t we need a sub-budget to explain? May well be worth it, but how can we tell? They list tasks, but not at least rough estimated numbers. Also, how does this requested ask relate to the increase of $70K per studio for DCA, to account for increased work/communications/PR for State AG project. Third, I’d like to discuss DCA. There are benefits to how they are set up and operate that I would want to make sure we are not inadvertently undermining. DCA’s effectiveness has been driven in part by its ability to be nimble and aggressive, and broaden the membership base w/ non-studio support. Thanks.

In short, this is a strategy based on supporting and strengthening the ongoing State AG effort, as was discussed at the last GC meeting. This strategy is a subset of the larger Goliath strategy presented at the GC meeting and, in order to keep the attached digestible, assumes familiarity with the larger Goliath strategy document. Because the AG effort is ongoing, and at a sensitive time, we request your approval by Monday, March 31st. If you have questions, of course, do not hesitate to call. Likewise, although I did not think another group discussion was necessary, if any of you do, I will schedule a call. There are two related issues to clarify. The first concerns how we will pay for this; the second concerns the relationship between this proposal/budget and the DCA budget. How will we pay for the proposed Goliath strategy? Importantly, and I may not have made this clear at the GC meeting, this recommendation does not come with a “call” for additional funds. At this time, we are going to fund the expanded AG program out of the Legal Trust. It is the nature of the Legal Trust that there are funds earmarked for matters that never materialize and/or that take on a lower priority in light of emerging needs. Here, the 2014 Legal Trust budget has $1 million earmarked for Hotfile. Obviously, the Hotfile case has concluded; there are some modest legal activities (responding to EFF motions to unseal the record, for example). But, in large part, that money earmarked for Hotfile will not be spent on Hotfile. We would thus divert that money to partially/mostly cover the cost of the expanded AG effort. That said, the AG effort is a substantial effort that requires substantial resources that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust.

We recall that Tom P. threw out a number like 70K for a “basic” analysis by Keystone of Goliath operations. The idea was to see what would be truly required to give the AGs what they need to build their arguments. All longer-term outlays were to be discussed further because we’re still digesting the larger Goliath proposal and undecided about its scope. Second, not sure I’m following the actual numbers proposed. The current proposal of $400K for the first year is nearly as large as the original proposal of $500K for the first year. Why? And do we really have to approve another $300K for a second year at this time? As to Jenner’s 650K, don’t we need a sub-budget to explain? May well be worth it, but how can we tell? They list tasks, but not at least rough estimated numbers. Also, how does this requested ask relate to the increase of $70K per studio for DCA, to account for increased work/communications/PR for State AG project. Third, I’d like to discuss DCA. There are benefits to how they are set up and operate that I would want to make sure we are not inadvertently undermining. DCA’s effectiveness has been driven in part by its ability to be nimble and aggressive, and broaden the membership base w/ non-studio support. Thanks.

Importantly, and I may not have made this clear at the GC meeting, this recommendation does not come with a “call” for additional funds. At this time, we are going to fund the expanded AG program out of the Legal Trust. It is the nature of the Legal Trust that there are funds earmarked for matters that never materialize and/or that take on a lower priority in light of emerging needs. Here, the 2014 Legal Trust budget has $1 million earmarked for Hotfile. Obviously, the Hotfile case has concluded; there are some modest legal activities (responding to EFF motions to unseal the record, for example). But, in large part, that money earmarked for Hotfile will not be spent on Hotfile. We would thus divert that money to partially/mostly cover the cost of the expanded AG effort. That said, the AG effort is a substantial effort that requires substantial resources that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust. There are also several other initiatives we are working on that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust (e.g., the ISP Measures/512(j) project, a broad based advertising strategy, a global cyberlocker strategy, the renewed Xunlei negotiations, and others); and there are certain initiatives that we are engaging in at a more substantial level than budgeted (e.g., the major UK site blocking initiative). If each of these initiatives moves forward to the implementation stage in 2014 – which should be what we all seek – there will be a strain on the Legal Trust and we very well may end up coming back to you with a call for additional Legal Trust funds towards the latter part of the year. In that sense, everything we do (whether we are calling for funds or not) should be assessed in terms of its value relative to budget and other priorities. We believe the current Goliath proposal and recommendation meets that test. How does this relate to the general DCA budget or other requests for funding from DCA? I cannot yet profess to be the expert on the DCA or its budget. However, I can report that the present Goliath proposal is not overlapping with DCA activities or budgets. It is complementary and will be coordinated with DCA’s own activities. DCA does some anti-Goliath public advocacy. The existing AG effort has been loosely coordinated with DCA. In that regard, DCA does some fact gathering, but typically at a fairly superficial level – not at the level we need for the State AG’s. DCA also does a lot of other advocacy on piracy and related digital issues – i.e., public advocacy not related to Goliath at all. In connection with the bolstered State AG effort, we intend to take more of a leading role in directing DCA’s anti-Goliath efforts, to ensure DCA’s own activities support our activities. We also intend to use DCA as one of the primary public advocacy platforms for the anti-Goliath information and evidence we develop through our investigation.

We have thought through two different resource levels for the AG project. Option 1 would provide the level of resources necessary to keep the AG project going on its current course. We have had success to date in motivating the AG’s; however, as they approach the CID phase, the AG’s will need greater levels of legal support. Thus, Option 1 focuses largely on direct Jenner legal support for the AG’s litigation-related activities. It also includes some modest resources devoted to communications (a) to support the AG’s and (b) to amplify our message about Goliath. Specifically, the budget for Option 1 consists of: Jenner ($500k) Legal research/analysis re possible AG claims Draft CIDs and motions/pleadings in support of CIDs and other litigation re AG claims Legal advice and counsel to AG’s Assistance with review of documents produced pursuant to CIDs Generally, assist AG’s with substance of issues Comms ($85k) Direct media support to AG’S re CIDs and litigation/enforcement actions Respond to/rebut Goliath’s public advocacy Amplify negative Goliath news Seed media stories based on investigation and AG actions The total Option 1 budget for year one is $585,000. Given where we are in the year, we anticipate the remaining 2014 budget to be between $300-400k. Option 2 would provide the level of resources necessary to potentially increase the impact of the AG effort. As explained in the attached document, creating an environment to potentially increase the impact of the AG effort requires additional resources devoted to investigation and analysis of Goliath. This investigation and analysis would give the AG’s a greater understanding of the problems created by Goliath (ammunition/evidence against Goliath), and the technical solutions for those problems. In large part, the difference between Options 1 and 2 is Keystone (and the related Jenner activities related to working with Keystone). Included in the attachment to this email is a document prepared by Keystone laying out in some detail the nature of the services they would be providing and the specific issues and information gaps those services address. The budget for Option 2 is the same as the budget previously presented, except that we have eliminated the funds earmarked for a potential documentary based on the feedback from the group. Specifically, the budget for Option 2 consists of: Investigation and Analysis Keystone: See attached document ($340k) Jenner: Work with Keystone to develop analyses and evidence, and package evidence for advocacy ($150k) AG Support Jenner ($500k) Legal research/analysis re possible AG claims Draft CIDs and motions/pleadings in support of CIDs and other litigation re AG claims Legal advice and counsel to AG’s Assistance with review of documents produced pursuant to CIDs Generally, assist AG’s with substance of issues Hemu ($60k) Long-time trusted AG advisor who AG’s want as resource Assist AG’s to understand/assimilate evidence and claims Vet/vouch for our work product Public spokesperson for AG’s as needed Direct media support for AG’s CID and litigation/enforcement actions ($25k) Public Advocacy ($100k) Respond to/rebut Goliath’s public advocacy Amplify negative Goliath news Seed media stories based on investiga",Private

Many of you will want to pour over every detail, including appendices; others of you will be more interested in the highlights. Hence, the first seven pages is a comprehensive executive summary. Regardless of which camp you fall into, at the GC meeting on March 12, we will present a PowerPoint that walks you though the full approach, hopefully in a way that encourages questions and, more importantly, brainstorming to refine and improve the strategy. Any strategy of this sort needs to remain flexible, and regularly adapt and evolve, based on what we continue to learn. It is, in some sense, never “final.” But, we believe we have enough thoughts in place to put forward a productive framework. We’ve worked closely with Tom and team on this since our last GC meeting. Virtually all corners of the MPAA have contributed, especially Comms, Policy and Legal; several of our MPAA colleagues are still evaluating the output and overall approach in parallel with you. The Goliath project presents a lot for us to think about. There is much to commend an expanded Goliath strategy – the status quo has not exactly been favorable for us and, absent our doing something, it doesn’t promise to get better anytime soon. Seemingly for that reason, a couple of the studio heads called for a “get tough” strategy at the December board meeting. At the same time, the Goliath project represents a significant undertaking, with real costs and risks, and deserves critical scrutiny and evaluation. Bear in mind, and as we will discuss more at the meeting, we have designed this so it is not an “all or nothing” approach. While we believe the foundational investigation and record building is essential to moving forward on any part of the strategy, beyond that, we can pick and choose how to proceed. The tradeoff, of course, is that moving the needle is challenging (and uncertain) enough; scaling down the approach may impact our ability to achieve our ultimate objectives. It would be useful to use walk away from the GC meeting with a decision to go forward (at least as to the investigation stage, which requires a long ramp up time). However, that will be up to you and the discussion we have at the meeting. To state the obvious: This document is highly sensitive beyond its legal privilege. I’ve copied your +1s to the extent they’ve been identified. You should forward this to those I’ve missed. However, I urge you not to forward this document to anyone else unless you feel their review is essential for a proper internal consideration of the topic. Keeping the document within an extremely tight circle of attorneys is the best way to ensure that it stays as confidential as we want it to. If you need something for others at your companies, we would be happy to create a short briefing summary that covers the essentials at a high level. Finally, by way of apology, I had intended to circulate these materials a couple of days ago, so you would have a full week with them before the GC meeting. The unexpected trip to London for VCAP meetings put me a little behind. (Separate report on the VCAP meetings to follow.) Hopefully that will not prejudice your review. I look forward to seeing you and getting your input next week. SBF ————————————————————— Steven B.

Virtually all corners of the MPAA have contributed, especially Comms, Policy and Legal; several of our MPAA colleagues are still evaluating the output and overall approach in parallel with you. The Goliath project presents a lot for us to think about. There is much to commend an expanded Goliath strategy – the status quo has not exactly been favorable for us and, absent our doing something, it doesn’t promise to get better anytime soon. Seemingly for that reason, a couple of the studio heads called for a “get tough” strategy at the December board meeting. At the same time, the Goliath project represents a significant undertaking, with real costs and risks, and deserves critical scrutiny and evaluation. Bear in mind, and as we will discuss more at the meeting, we have designed this so it is not an “all or nothing” approach. While we believe the foundational investigation and record building is essential to moving forward on any part of the strategy, beyond that, we can pick and choose how to proceed. The tradeoff, of course, is that moving the needle is challenging (and uncertain) enough; scaling down the approach may impact our ability to achieve our ultimate objectives. It would be useful to use walk away from the GC meeting with a decision to go forward (at least as to the investigation stage, which requires a long ramp up time). However, that will be up to you and the discussion we have at the meeting. To state the obvious: This document is highly sensitive beyond its legal privilege. I’ve copied your +1s to the extent they’ve been identified. You should forward this to those I’ve missed. However, I urge you not to forward this document to anyone else unless you feel their review is essential for a proper internal consideration of the topic. Keeping the document within an extremely tight circle of attorneys is the best way to ensure that it stays as confidential as we want it to. If you need something for others at your companies, we would be happy to create a short briefing summary that covers the essentials at a high level. Finally, by way of apology, I had intended to circulate these materials a couple of days ago, so you would have a full week with them before the GC meeting. The unexpected trip to London for VCAP meetings put me a little behind. (Separate report on the VCAP meetings to follow.) Hopefully that will not prejudice your review. I look forward to seeing you and getting your input next week. SBF ————————————————————— Steven B.

"Goliath - Approval Requested by Monday, March 31st - PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT This requests your approval of the Goliath strategy and budget reflected in the attached. In short, this is a strategy based on supporting and strengthening the ongoing State AG effort, as was discussed at the last GC meeting. This strategy is a subset of the larger Goliath strategy presented at the GC meeting and, in order to keep the attached digestible, assumes familiarity with the larger Goliath strategy document. Because the AG effort is ongoing, and at a sensitive time, we request your approval by Monday, March 31st. If you have questions, of course, do not hesitate to call. Likewise, although I did not think another group discussion was necessary, if any of you do, I will schedule a call. There are two related issues to clarify. The first concerns how we will pay for this; the second concerns the relationship between this proposal/budget and the DCA budget. How will we pay for the proposed Goliath strategy? Importantly, and I may not have made this clear at the GC meeting, this recommendation does not come with a “call” for additional funds. At this time, we are going to fund the expanded AG program out of the Legal Trust. It is the nature of the Legal Trust that there are funds earmarked for matters that never materialize and/or that take on a lower priority in light of emerging needs. Here, the 2014 Legal Trust budget has $1 million earmarked for Hotfile. Obviously, the Hotfile case has concluded; there are some modest legal activities (responding to EFF motions to unseal the record, for example). But, in large part, that money earmarked for Hotfile will not be spent on Hotfile. We would thus divert that money to partially/mostly cover the cost of the expanded AG effort. That said, the AG effort is a substantial effort that requires substantial resources that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust. There are also several other initiatives we are working on that were not budgeted in the Legal Trust (e.g., the ISP Measures/512(j) project, a broad based advertising strategy, a global cyberlocker strategy, the renewed Xunlei negotiations, and others); and there are certain initiatives that we are engaging in at a more substantial level than budgeted (e.g., the major UK site blocking initiative). If each of these initiatives moves forward to the implementation stage in 2014 – which should be what we all seek – there will be a strain on the Legal Trust and we very well may end up coming back to you with a call for additional Legal Trust funds towards the latter part of the year. In that sense, everything we do (whether we are calling for funds or not) should be assessed in terms of its value relative to budget and other priorities. We believe the current Goliath proposal and recommendation meets that test. How does this relate to the general DCA budget or other requests for funding from DCA? I cannot yet profess to be the expert on the DCA or its budget. However, I can report that the present Goliath proposal is not overlapping with DCA activities or budgets. It is complementary and will be coordinated with DCA’s own activities. DCA does some anti-Goliath public advocacy. The existing AG effort has been loosely coordinated with DCA. In that regard, DCA does some fact gathering, but typically at a fairly superficial level – not at the level we need for the State AG’s. DCA also does a lot of other advocacy on piracy and related digital issues – i.e., public advocacy not related to Goliath at all. In connection with the bolstered State AG effort, we intend to take more of a leading role in directing DCA’s anti-Goliath efforts, to ensure DCA’s own activities support our activities. We also intend to use DCA as one of the primary public advocacy platforms for the anti-Goliath information and evidence we develop through our investigation. We are pretty comfortable that what we are proposing is completely additive to what DCA has been and will be doing. Best regards. SBF ————————————————————— Steven B.

"Regarding Marketing, here are some macro thoughts:Will Smith Positioning – We will conduct an interview with Will in print or on camera maybe linked to Start of Production where the following points are made: Will is a fan of football. Loves the sport, played the sport and his son plays the sport. Importantly as an actor, he looks for roles that are challenging and inspiring. Bennet's story is one of the kinds of stories that is exciting to take on as an actor. That this immigrant without an agenda, no axe to grind uncovered a major medical find and goes on this incredible journey for his voice to be heard is a once in a lifetime role. Will is not anti football (nor is the movie) and isn't planning to be a spokesman for what football should be or shouldn't be but rather is an actor taking on an exciting challenge. I'd like to start here so that this definitive positioning is established.NFL – We'll develop messaging with the help of NFL consultant to ensure that we are telling a dramatic story and not kicking the hornet's nest. We will always be careful of how we represent that NFL itself in key art and images (we need to comply with fair use) and we'll walk a fine line as it relates to the ""David and Goliath"" nature of this story. We expect a healthy amount of NFL in our media flight and we'll seek to have sportscasters equipped to talk about this movie as an important development in the history of the game without casting blame or judgement.,Existing Perceptions – We will do a full audit of stories written and commentary that exists about the topic so that we identify key groups and communities who would seek to use the movie as a platform for their own agenda.Managing Controversy — we should give consideration to allowing voices on both sides of the issue to sound off as part of our campaign. We used this tactic on The Social Network when the privacy questions about Facebook were at their height — we highlighted both sides of the debate on a Tumblr blog. On The Da Vinci Code, we hired a faith based consultant to launch a site that allowed clergy to weigh in on the claims made by the book. Bennet — In the same way that we managed to get Chris Gardner's ""stamp of approval"" on The Pursuit of Happyness we'll consider how we'll use Bennet in the campaign ensuring that we keep him on message. His mission is about safety and saving lives but the MOVIE is about the American Dream on some level and how this outsider in seeking his own place seemingly threatened the American Dream of others. It's also a story about overcoming the odds. From: <Minghella>, Hannah Minghella <Hannah_Minghella@spe.sony.com>Date: Tuesday, August 5, 2014 5:11 PMTo: Amy Pascal <Amy_Pascal@spe.sony.com>Cc: Doug Belgrad <Doug_Belgrad@spe.sony.com>, ITPS <dwight_caines@spe.sony.com>Subject: your meeting with James tomorrow… Hey - Richard called with a heads-up regarding your noon meeting with James tomorrow. They have a number of questions re: the Concussion project that may well come up so here's a quick run down of what they're asking about along with some of the things we know at this stage. Obviously much of this still has to be worked out. I've cc'd Dwight who is going to follow-up with some additional thoughts… 1) release date: are we planning to release during football season? how does that affect/inform awards, etc.we are tentatively considering October 10th, 2015. Yes this is in the heart of football season (probably a larger discussion whether that's a good or bad thing). It puts us squarely into awards consideration and also keeps us ahead of any potential competition. 2) marketing planDwight is going to send you a separate email with his thoughts thus far. 3) communications plan with the NFL: initial messaging: what is the movie about? what is its purpose in the world? how do we take on the controversy: get ahead of it and/or plan response to NFL?Amy - up to you whether you want to talk about Tisch. We are very aware of all of the above issues and will work carefully together to craft our positioning. First and foremost this is not an anti-football movie. We have discussed the idea of finding players who can speak to the issues directly rather than the filmmakers. 4) are we hiring an NFL consultant?We are in the process of hiring Allen Mayer from 42 West (Erin Brokovich, Munich, Da Vinci Code) to be our consultant. Doug, Charlie and I met with him and Doug approved hiring him. Waiting for legal to confirm his deal has been signed. Fyi - Meredith Wasson, Will's publicist, is also at 42 West. 5) what is our plan with the mainstream media? ESPN, Fox Sports, etc?see Dwight's response... 6) what is our position with Gooddell, who is portrayed in the movie?",Private

We thought last year’s inaugural meeting was a productive session, and plan to participate fully in this year’s edition. A few comments on the proposed agenda from the NBCUniversal team: 1) We suggest that, after the discussion of global copyright reviews, we immediately turn to a global content protection review, which would include region-specific issues (currently relegated to the last item on day 2) and the major outcomes of the regional strategy meetings that will have been held during the month of June. 2) Within the “combating content theft” section, we think a discussion of where we are on the Goliath project would be worth specifically noting on the agenda, along with site blocking, cyberlockers, and notice-sending programs. 3) You may want to consider moving communications to the very end, as it supports everything else. 4) We are assuming that Creative Future will be discussed as part of Strategic Alliance Building on day 2; is that correct? 5) We should specifically set aside time at the end of the second day for a recap of what we learned, what we agreed on, and any critical follow-ups. The memo you sent last year after the session was helpful, but it would be good to make sure we’re all more or less on the same page before we scatter to the winds. 6) On that last point, it was very helpful last year to have a clear understanding of decisions that needed to be made at the meeting, and I recall that several matters of lingering contention were cleared up during those discussions (and, of course, several more created). We hope questions for resolution can be clearly identified well in advance of the meeting so there will be adequate time for intra- and inter-company discussions before the 29th.

"Site Blocking/ISP Measures - INPUT REQUESTED - PRIVILEGED PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT We did not get to have a full discussion of site blocking during our January meeting. However, I believe I have spoken with enough of you individually to have a good read of the room as to our authority to proceed with the necessary analysis. In this email, I outline the planned scope of analysis. Because the analysis will involve some expense for technical experts, consultants and lawyers (likely totalling in the $200-300k range), I want to make sure we are on the same page. If anyone disagrees with the plan, as described below, please let me know. Otherwise, we will proceed, with the goal of having something to present to you at our March meeting. (My goal is to use our February meeting to present and discuss a detailed US Goliath strategy.) SCOPE We have traditionally thought of site blocking in the US as a DMCA 512(j) issue. In some ways, that is too narrow and we plan to expand our scope of inquiry on two levels. First, DMCA 512(j), by its terms, necessarily creates an adversarial relationship with the target ISP (and more generally with the ISP community). We have been exploring theories under the All Writs Acts, which, unlike DMCA 512(j), would allow us to obtain court orders requiring site blocking without first having to sue and prove the target ISPs are liable for copyright infringement. This may open up avenues for cooperative arrangements with ISPs. Second, we start from the premise that site blocking is a means to an end (the end being effective measures by ISPs to prevent infringement through notorious pirate sites). There may be other equally effective measures ISPs can take, and that they might be more willing to take voluntarily. Our intention is to work with our own retained experts and Comcast (and MPAA’s Technology group) to identify and study these other possibilities, as well as US site blocking technical issues. ANALYSIS The analyses that remain to be done fall into three general categories: Legal Analyses. The legal analyses that remain to be completed are the smallest part of the project. We need to finalize the All Writs Act research and confirm that developments in the law since the time of previous 512(j) analyses do not materially affect the existing analyses. In the event we recommend or present litigation options, we will also consider tactical issues, including issues related to venue and the interplay of the All Writs Act and 512(j). Technical Analyses. Very little systematic work has been completed to understand the technical issues related to site blocking in the US and/or alternative measures IPSs might adopt. We will identify and retain a consulting technical expert to work with us to study these issues. In this context, we will explore which options might lead ISPs to cooperate with us. Political Analyses. Here, we mean political in the broadest sense. There are important Hill issues to consider (e.g., how a strategy might impact the copyright review process). We also need to consider ISP relations issues (e.g., whether a strategy might impact the Copyright Alert program, or any progress we have been making to secure voluntary ISP assistance). Finally, in the post-SOPA world, we need to consider the extent to which a strategy presents a risk of a public relations backlash (e.g., whether a strategy might invigorate and galvanize the anti-copyright forces we saw in the SOPA debates, and what ultimate impact that might have). Each of these issues are like to have considerations that cut in many directions. To get a comprehensive assessment and weigh them in context, we will work closely with the MPAA Policy and Communications teams (and, with them, will solicit input from the appropriate studio policy and communications people). Hopefully, at the conclusion of this set of analyses, we will be in a position to make a decision that is informed by all considerations of consequence. If you have any questions, or want to talk through any of this, don’t hesitate to call. Best, SBF ————————————————————— Steven B.

Since you may be less in touch on North Korea, thought you might like to see the latest on DPRK’s response to “The Interview.” Bob North Korea Takes Complaint About Assassination Movie to White House (By Alastair Gale, AP, July 17, 2014) How much free publicity can North Korea give to an upcoming movie about a plot to assassinate its leader? Pyongyang’s latest escalation of its PR campaign against “The Interview”, a comedy caper due to be released in the U.S. in the fall, is a letter to the office of U.S. President Barack Obama, according to Voice of America. In it, North Korea again complains that the movie is an insult to its leader, Kim Jong Un, VOA reports, citing unnamed sources. In the film, a U.S. TV crew secures an interview with Mr. Kim and is hired by the CIA to assassinate him (it’s not clear yet if they succeed). The White House couldn’t be immediately reached to comment, but the VOA cited National Security Council spokesman Patrick Ventrell as saying Washington is already aware of North Korea’s complaint. “The views [in the movie] are obviously those of the filmmaker and the producer of the film but we don’t have any role in that. They are free to do whatever they want to do artistically,” he is quoted as saying. In June, the North’s foreign ministry published a statement in familiar hyperbole about the movie that was portrayed by some Western media outlets as a threat of war if the film was released. “The enemies have gone beyond the tolerance limit in their despicable moves to dare hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK,” the statement said, using the abbreviated form of North Korea’s official name, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The statement was subsequently submitted by North Korea as part of a letter of complaint to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. In the letter, North Korea’s ambassador to the UN said the U.S. should ban the production of the film, “otherwise, it will be fully responsible for encouraging and sponsoring terrorism.” Given that much of the life’s work of North Korean officials and the nation’s state media is devoted to boosting the ruling Kim family, it isn’t too surprising that they are pushing this issue as far as they can. There’s taste of that in the part of the foreign ministry statement that claims North Koreans “regard the supreme leadership as dearer than their own lives.” Meanwhile, the production company for the movie, which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco, must grateful for all the free publicity.

"North Korea Should Stop Helping ""The Interview² Michael, I thought you would want to see the article below. Radio Free Chosun is a South Korean radio station that seeks change in North Korea. The DailyNK newspaper is a pretty good source of news on North Korea. Thanks, Bruce http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=12076&cataId=nk00300 North Korea Should Stop Helping ""The Interview” Radio Free Chosun | 2014-07-15 17:09 [There is a lot of interest in the information and opinion that is broadcast by shortwave radio stations targeting North Korea. One of these, Radio Free Chosun, has agreed to allow Daily NK to publish some of their scripts in translation. Here, published as a Commentary, is their take on an absurd spat over the Seth Rogen film “The Interview.”] North Korean Ambassador to the UN Ja Song Nam recently sent a letter of protest to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon regarding the new Hollywood comedy film ""The Interview"", claiming it promotes terrorism against North Korea. The letter included a statement from the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting that a formal memorandum be sent to the UN General Assembly and UN Security Council. Calling on senior officials to get involved in this case only lays North Korea open to further ridicule. Could they possibly think that this type of behavior would improve the image of Kim Jong Eun? Many films poking fun at political leaders have been made down the years, and yet none has elicited such a protest. This is of course because most of the world recognizes that film content is subject to creative license and freedom of expression. This film is not a documentary. It is a comedic work of art intended to make people laugh by pointing out, amongst other things, the ludicrousness of hereditary succession to a man who has not even turned 30. Isn’t Kim Jong Eun, a portly form in a land of hunger, suitable material for comedic ridicule? If he doesn't like it, he should find a better way to go about things. He'd be better off acting naturally and not imitating his grandfather, Kim Il Sung. Perhaps he should give some youthful qualities a shot. Ordering salutes from the people and exuding arrogance in every photo further pushes viewers of the film to find commonalities between reality and fantasy. He should bear in mind that this air of pretension provides fodder for further mockery from the international community. * These are the views of Radio Free Chosun, and do not necessarily reflect those of Daily NK. __________________________________________________________________________ This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential information.

"Re: Follow up at rand I just spoke with Debra Knopman. She would be delighted to set up a series of interviews for Seanie in DC. Apparently that is the center for public health research for RAND and they have some great people. They also have a two year program for folks just out of college that is a research internship. The best thing is to be in touch with her directly (she offered to do this, and she is great) she is at Knopman@RAND.org or 703 413 1100 ext 5667. I will also find out more information on other alternatives from David Goldhill.

"FW: North Korea Takes Case Against Rogen Film to UN Michael, My friend, Bob King, passed this on today. I thought you would want to see it. Thanks, Bruce From: ""Amb. Robert King"" <KingRR@state.gov> Date: Thursday, July 10, 2014 at 7:42 AM To: Bruce Bennett <bennett@rand.org> Subject: North Korea Takes Case Against Rogen Film to UN Bruce, Don’t know if you saw this AFP item (below) about the DPRK lodging a formal protest with the UN on “The Interview.” The DPRK has requested that its protest be circulated as a UN document. Normal procedure is that any member country can request that a document be circulated, and the UN does it pro-forma. The document will be circulated, but I doubt that anything else will happen. Bob North Korea Takes Case Against Rogen Film to UN (AFP, July 10, 2014) United Nations (United States) (AFP) - North Korea has lodged a formal protest at the United Nations against a Hollywood comedy about an assassination bid on leader Kim Jong-Un and asked Washington to block the film's release. ""The Interview"" stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as two tabloid television journalists who land an interview with Kim in Pyongyang and are then tasked by the CIA with killing him. The film is due to be released in the United States on October 14. In a letter addressed to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and seen on Wednesday, North Korea's UN envoy Ja Song-Nam says allowing the film to be made and seen constitutes ""the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as a war action."" ""The US authorities should take immediate and appropriate action to ban the production and distribution of the film, otherwise it will be fully responsible for encouraging and sponsoring terrorism,"" the letter says. North Korea asked that the letter be circulated as an official document to members of the UN General Assembly and Security Council for their consideration. Last month, North Korea denounced the film as a ""wanton act of terror"" and warned of a ""merciless response"" unless it were pulled from distribution. In a statement carried by North Korea's official KCNA news agency, a foreign ministry spokesman said the film was the work of ""gangster moviemakers"" and should never be shown. Rogen poked fun at the threat on Twitter, writing: ""People don't usually wanna kill me for one of my movies until after they've paid 12 bucks for it."" ""The Interview"" is not the first Hollywood film to mock a North Korean leader. In the 2004 satirical action comedy ""Team America,"" Kim's father Kim Jong-Il was portrayed as a speech-impaired, isolated despot.

"The Fortune interview: Rupert Murdoch (4/10/14) FYI only The Fortune Interview: Rupert Murdoch by Patricia Sellers April 10, 2014 Defending a newspaper empire amid scandal, splitting a global media conglomerate into two public companies, enduring a high-profile divorce, and struggling to repair frayed relationships with grown children -- it's been a trying few years for Rupert Murdoch. A week after turning 83, Murdoch sat down with Fortune senior editor-at-large Pattie Sellers for his first wide-ranging interview with the press since 2009. He was feisty, highly opinionated, and game to talk about the biggest challenges of his storied life (save for the allegations of phone hacking by News Corp. journalists in Britain, which he declined to discuss for legal reasons). And though battered by turmoil and strife -- and a recent fall on his head, as he revealed in this Q&A -- Murdoch seems newly secure as the world's most powerful global media billionaire. Starting with a single Australian newspaper that he inherited from his father in 1952, Murdoch built News Corp., which owns the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, the Times of London, the leading newspapers in Australia, and book publisher HarperCollins. Last July he split News Corp. from 21st Century Fox, which owns the Fox broadcast network, cable assets including Fox News and new ESPN rival Fox Sports 1, the 20th Century Fox movie studio, and satellite broadcasting operations across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. The combined stock market value of his two companies exceeds $80 billion. Murdoch owns nearly 40%, controls the voting stock, and calls the shots. Murdoch recently handed the keys to the kingdom to his two sons. Lachlan, 42, is the new nonexecutive chairman of both News Corp. and 21st Century Fox -- a stunning comeback for Murdoch's elder son, who in 2005 quit his News Corp. job over clashes with senior management and returned to Australia to build his own empire. Son James, 41, who was tarnished in News Corp.'s phone-hacking scandal, moved up to co-chief operating officer at 21st Century Fox. Fortune: You've had a very eventful past few years. How have you come out of this, and has it taught you anything? Murdoch: Oh, it's been stressful. I'm quite open about it. I was reluctant to see the company split, and now I've got to say that I've been proved wrong. I think it's been a great success. And I'm not talking about the share market. I think the two companies, which were all in one before, are now much more focused, which will lead to faster growth. Why were you reluctant to split the company? I guess it was emotional. You, some say, ""endowed"" News Corp. with close to $3 billion in cash. Meanwhile, Time Inc. is spinning off from Time Warner with $1.3 billion in debt. Does that make sense to you? No. Well, I don't want to criticize here. It's a very fine company with great assets. But print is going through a tough time. There's got to be a lot of money spent on digitizing everything. You've got to keep improving and competing in a new world, as well as keeping your old world going. So to have some spare cash gives you a lot of security. Whereas at Time I would imagine that the new management is going to be looking immediately at how can they save money. I hope we're not wasting money, but we're spending. What don't people understand about you? Well, they perhaps tend to think I've not got as thick a skin as I have. You know, I don't mind what people say about me. I've never read a book about myself. Has this been your toughest period ever? Well, everything has sort of come at once. But I was in an unhappy situation, and all I'm worried about or do worry about is two beautiful little girls from that marriage [to Wendi Deng, whom he divorced last November]. And they come and stay with me a great deal. I feel like I've turned over a new page in my life. How long do you think you will live? Well, my mother just died at 103, so that's a start. You should live 20 years longer than your parents. [Laughs.] That may not be realistic, but I'm in good physical shape, according to the doctors. And don't worry -- my children will be the first to tell me if I start losing some mental ability. That will be the time to step back. News Corp. acquired Dow Jones in 2007, bringing the Wall Street Journal into its stable of print assets needing to adapt to a digital age. Efforts to leverage Dow Jones's Factiva business database have faltered. Let's talk about the newspaper business. Is it fair to say that the game is to cut costs faster than revenue declines and -- No! Why is that wrong? Well, obviously when you come to a difficult period, you look at all your costs very, very carefully. But we haven't gone nearly as far as some of the other papers have, like the L.A. Times and the Chicago Tribune or a lot of lesser papers. We've added a lot of things to the Wall Street Journal. We honestly believe that it's the best newspaper in America, if not the world. Why keep the New York Post going? I don't know what it lost last year, but I think that in 2012 it lost $40 million. It's in that area. Why keep it alive? Advertising has been very difficult. We're looking at various plans for the Post. We are working very hard on the digital edition. Are you suggesting that in the next five years the Post as a print newspaper could go away and digital would be it? I would be surprised. I'm not saying it's impossible. I would think it might be quite likely in 10 years. What about the Wall Street Journal? Is that likely to exist in print form in 10 years? I think so. Maybe not in 20. A lot of people are very happy to read their newspaper either on their iPad or -- startlingly and faster and faster the figures go up -- on their telephone, on their smartphone. At the London Times a third of our circulation is on a tablet. And people who read it on their tablet are spending 20% more time than if they're reading the paper. In looking to expand News Corp., the biggest challenge, I would assume, is monetizing digital efforts. Yeah, and that leads us to all sorts of things. For instance, in London our digital includes video. We bought the video rights to the Premier League [England's top soccer league] and their highlights. Now if you look at the London Times, you'll find that with quite a number of the photographs, you touch them and they turn into videos. I think newspapers come alive that way. We talk about ""papers."" We should cut out the word ""paper,"" you know? It's ""news organizations."" That's a good idea. We have duties to our shareholders to give them the best possible returns, but we see them also as much more. They can be a great power for good. And that takes me back all the way to my father, who specifically had left me, by the standards of those days, a silver spoon -- but still a tiny paper, half a tiny paper, my sisters and I. He hoped that I would have the opportunity to have a useful life in media. And he wasn't talking about making money. Do you think about your father a lot? Yes. If I'm looking backward, which I don't do much, he's quite the most important sort of formative influence and figure that I would admire in the past. News Corp. created a subscription-based web venture, DJX, that bundles data services to compete with Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters. It stumbled out of the gate, didn't it? Yes. What is the lesson and what's the future of that? Well, I think the lesson was that we didn't do a good job. I think the concept is absolutely right, but we should have taken longer and got all those things right. The heart of that is Factiva, which we are now spending a lot of time improving, and repairing the relations with the people. People loved Factiva. [We said to Factiva customers:] ""Look, you've got to pay much, much more money, and you've got to take everything or nothing."" They said, ""Nothing."" So we're now repairing that. First we get Factiva right; then we get the other special services right. Whether we'll bundle them exactly in that way, I'm not sure. Do you look with envy or admiration at Bloomberg? The company, not the man. I look at the man more than the company. What do you think of the man? I like the man. And admire him. As for the company, he took an incredible stroke of luck and saw this great opportunity and established something. And he kept pushing it. And now those who use it buy it at a huge price -- can't live without it. Mike's got a virtual monopoly there. When their costs go up a bit, they put the prices up, and no one cancels. And they keep growing slowly. It's a very small market, a very elite market. I remember when he rang me one day to complain about some criticism in the Post. I said, ""I've just read Bloomberg View, and it absolutely lacerated me."" He said, ""Oh, nobody reads that."" [Laughs.] News Corp. owns a successful Australian business called Realestate.com.au that many of our readers have probably never heard of. It's been growing so fast. My son Lachlan bought that. He bought the first 44% in 2001 for $1 million. Are you serious? Yes. And some free publicity. And it cost us about $100 million to buy the next 18%. Now we've got 60-odd percent. And it's got a market cap of $7 billion Australian [$6.5 billion U.S.]. It's got huge viewership. People go to it just to look at how other people live in houses. And some of them say, ""Oh, perhaps I'll buy that."" If you talk to any agent in Australia, they'll say that over 90% of their business comes from REA, which of course has devastated the classified advertising in some of our newspapers. What's the lesson? And is Realestate.com.au replicable? We're looking at expanding REA a lot outside Australia. We've looked at all the companies in America that stand out: Zillow and Trulia and so on. And we've thought they were overpriced. News Corp. began expanding into the TV and movie businesses in the mid-1980s. Today 21st Century Fox, the holding company for those assets, has a market cap more than seven times as large as Murdoch's once-core newspaper business. Let's talk about 21st Century Fox. The film company is doing very well, and of course it's got a bonus now with the Netflixes and the Amazons coming in buying programs. We plan to step up our production of major films. We've got on our plate one or two or maybe more sequels to Avatar, which was the biggest film in history. I knew about one. There may be two sequels? The end of '16 is the first sequel. If we make it, it will be the first time Jim Cameron's been on time or on budget. But he's never lost me. When he finally comes through, they're just huge hits. Are you going to hire [DreamWorks CEO] Stacey Snider? I would like to. I'm a great admirer of hers. And I've had long talks with her. I think they're at a stage -- it would be improper to talk more about that. It's really for [Fox Studio chief] Jim Gianopulos to hire her. Your new Fox Sports 1 network is a very big bet. Well, it's a pretty big bet. We certainly expect to lose a couple hundred million dollars for a year or two, and then we expect it to turn, and we'll gradually make it into a major alternative to ESPN. We're not going to put ESPN out of business. Why does ESPN need an alternative? I think the public deserves choice. Why? ESPN is a very, very good operation, and it's a gold mine. It's an even bigger gold mine than Fox News. Not that Fox News won't get there. Fox News is going to make over $1 billion this year, and can do a lot better. No cable company in the world is going to drop it unless they want their houses burned down. [Laughter.] But ESPN has managed to ride this Monday Night Football to the point where they're charging every home in America with cable. Over $5 a head. How many people watch ESPN? A third of the public, half the public? 21st Century Fox sold its 47% stake in STAR China TV in January. Why bail on China? Is this coincidental with your divorce? No. We had a couple of channels in China, which were making nothing. And to our happiness and surprise, they were valued at a couple hundred million by Shanghai Media Capital. They took 52% and made it profitable. And then they took up their option to buy us out of the other half. But is it fair to say that you kind of got fed up with China? Look, if you want to run your own media -- have control of it in China -- you'll get fed up very quick. But is there room to make interesting investments in China? It's obvious, yes. There's a huge amount of innovation going on in China. And we have a lot of relationships there: partly friendships, like with [Alibaba founder] Jack Ma, but also with Edward Tian, who's starting a vast cloud operation in Beijing. He runs funds, a few funds, in which we have 20% stakes, which have done very well. As for making movies in China, we're going to try again. But in the past it has been impossible to get American directors to go there. Because once you get there, they want to censor every line in every movie, and they can take a month giving you a decision on one line. Part of the reason Murdoch is so globally powerful -- and controversial -- is that he has used his media properties to wield political clout. In the U.S. there's no better example than Fox News, which routinely tramples on its own slogan, ""Fair and balanced."" Does it bother you at all, Rupert, that there is a view that Fox News has contributed in a big way to the political discontent in the U.S., degraded the political process, and maybe, in spotlighting the Tea Party, even hurt the Republican Party? I think it has absolutely saved it. It has certainly given voice and hope to people who didn't like all that liberal championing thrown at them on CNN. By the way, we don't promote the Tea Party. That's bullshit. We recognize their existence. Does it bother you that Facebook is as successful as it is, and MySpace could have been Facebook? I think that was one of our great screwups of all time. What was the mistake? Buying it? It was part of Fox. No one knew anything about it, so they [installed] a bunch of people to try to watch it. If they weren't happy with the people running it, they should have gone and hired Mark Zuckerberg or someone like him, all right? I mean, when Mark came, we had just bought it for $600 million. Everybody thought [it was worth] $6 billion, and we were hailed everywhere for a very short time. I remember Mark coming down to visit my ranch. He was a very shy, quiet young man of about 20 or 21. And he was all for us getting together. And I didn't take him up on it. I think he's done a brilliant job. Would you put your money into Facebook today? The people in Silicon Valley don't agree with me, but I think that $200 billion [market cap] for that, no matter how good the company, is going to be very hard to justify in the long term. I don't have confidence in the permanence of any particular social app or social network, you know? Obviously you like Twitter. My family are horrified that I'm on it. They think it's ridiculous. And people like [News Corp. CEO] Robert Thomson have said, ""No, it's extremely good personal public relations to show you're interested in more than just making money."" Is cable consolidation your biggest worry? No. We're all standing back at the moment and having a look at this big cable consolidation and haven't decided yet whether it's any threat to us. And that would go for other broadcasting companies and Silicon Valley companies. We've not decided to make any submissions or get too excited about it. Look, Comcast gives a very good service. And if they could make Time Warner as good as they are, a lot of people would benefit. What kind of a leader are you? I'm a permanently curious person. I probably waste my time being curious about things that have got nothing to do with the business sometimes. What keeps me alive, certainly, is curiosity. What are your thoughts on the next U.S. presidential race? Oh, I have no settled thoughts at all. I'm watching it with great interest. What are your unsettled thoughts? I think there are some very interesting candidates. Could you live with Hillary Clinton as President? I could live with Hillary as President. We have to live with who we get. We don't have any choice. Can you envision yourself supporting Hillary? It would depend on the Republican candidate totally. Who do you think the Republican candidate will be, or who would you like it to be? I think it's between four or five people. It's not necessarily, although slightly, in order of preference: Jeb Bush, Paul Ryan, whom I have particular admiration for. I do for both. [Chris] Christie could recover. Scott Walker, whom I don't know, and Rand Paul, whom I agree with on a great number of things but disagree strongly on some things -- too strongly perhaps to vote for him. You disagree with Paul most strongly on what? Foreign policy. Why do you admire Paul Ryan? He is the straightest arrow I've ever met. He's hardworking. He knows where every dollar goes in Washington. He's emerging as the natural leader. I almost think that because of the position he's in, he's not the most important, but he's the most influential Republican in his party at the moment in Washington. What do you like about Jeb Bush? I think he's a man of very fine character. He was a great governor. And I particularly like his policy on education, which I'm hardest on. My number one. You're spending a lot of money in the education space. I've read about Amplify. It looks like, ""Oh, boy, this is one of Rupert Murdoch's passion plays."" It's a big passion play gamble, yes. Well, we would not think it a gamble. We have hundreds of people on it, preparing these classes and the software that goes into them. When you get a tablet, which allows the teacher to assess each child day by day, it's a huge teachers' aid and a huge aid to kids. Because kids, when they're 3 years old, never mind when they're 10, would rather be working on an electronic device and learning. Every lesson now is animated, so that's what's taking time. And then we test them in front of kids and bring in groups of teachers on every single 40-minute class we prepare. Do you envision this to be a high-return business? Potentially it will be, but it's a few years out. Let's talk briefly about HarperCollins. Book publishing is another business under great stress. We were going to make a record profit this year. We find electronic publishing of books very good. People are buying more books. They buy them at lower prices. We still get a good margin, and we don't have to have huge warehouses and take returns from every bookshop in the world. Our experience with ebooks is very good, and we intend to expand it. Do you read books on your iPad? I've got to confess, I don't. It's a generational thing. I've never bought a Kindle. I ought to get one, I guess. If you look at our business, Kindle is infinitely bigger (than the iPad), Amazon infinitely bigger than Apple. Apple may catch them, I don't know. It's been a challenging decade for Murdoch's adult children. After Lachlan left News Corp. to go back to Australia in 2005, James served his father loyally -- and got tarred in the phone-hacking scandal after taking charge of News Corp.'s British newspapers in 2007. Family ties frayed in 2012 when Rupert's daughter Elisabeth, who chairs London-based TV production company Shine Limited, spoke disapprovingly of News Corp.'s handling of the hacking scandal while delivering an address in Scotland known as the MacTaggart Lecture. Do James and Lachlan's new positions mean that they are first in line to lead the businesses after you retire? Well, the job is not over yet. But yes, it does. But I'm going to be here for a long time. And so will [21st Century Fox president and COO] Chase Carey and Robert Thomson, the CEO of News Corp. Robert is the youngest of the three of us, so we'll get more years out of him. Is James an equal or almost-equal to Chase Carey, who is president and COO at 21st Century Fox? Chase is president of the company. [James] certainly will be reporting to Chase, but a lot more people [than before] will be reporting to James. How did you persuade Lachlan to come back? Look, he was always going to come back. Lachlan is someone who's been in love with media from the age of 12. He spent all his vacations working in pressrooms. But Lachlan and James and I had a very serious talk about how we can work as a team in July of last year. It was at the Allen & Co. conference. We broke away for a meal. We had two or three hours together. Lachlan was not not going to come back. It was a question of how we would work together. How would we be a team? Lachlan is a wonderful human being with his feet very firmly on the ground. He has built a very interesting business in Australia for himself, although he stayed on our boards. And James too. Everyone talks about hacking in London. That all happened long before James took charge. He took STAR television and [made it] the No. 1 broadcaster in India, with about eight channels, and is making a big difference to that country. And then he went to BSkyB, where people said, ""Oh, that must be nepotism."" But in fact, he went through a lot of tests. And when we took him out of his day-to-day role there and made him chairman, the same shareholders complained and said we can't lose him. He completely changed BSkyB and lifted the bar there in every way -- and added huge value to News Corp. Liz sold her production company, Shine, to News Corp. Why did she decline to go on the News Corp. board? I don't know. I'd rather not go into that. We're a very, very close family. You know what close families are like. They meet at breakfast. They meet at dinner. And they have good arguments. That doesn't mean they don't love each other or have room for each other in each other's lives. Were you bothered by Liz's MacTaggart Lecture? She put a lot of work into that and was very proud of it and got congratulations from everybody, except me. Because I thought it was falling in line too much with the sort of BBC and establishment. I think she was hurt when I said I didn't really love it or like it. Do you feel that stresses in the family have been repaired? Oh, I hope so. I had a long and warm and loving hour with her on the phone yesterday. But mainly talking about her kids and not about the business. Is it likely that she will get involved in the business again? It's more than possible. That's all I will say. Murdoch and Wendi Deng divorced last November after 14 years of marriage. A Vanity Fair story in March included alleged diary entries by Deng about other men. Since the divorce, Murdoch has bought a 13-acre vineyard, Moraga, above Bel Air, Calif. He also purchased a 10,000-square-foot apartment, near Madison Square Park in Manhattan, for $57.25 million. Rupert, what did you think when you read Wendi's [alleged] diary entries? I was shocked. But I didn't read them and I was not given them until after I had filed for divorce. I'm sure it made you feel as if you made the right decision. Right. I mean, I regret the whole Vanity Fair thing. I wish we just could have got divorced quietly. There is this view out there, and I'm sure you've heard it: ""Boy, Rupert, he makes a decision and he moves on."" Well, you know, everybody was talking about these things and never telling me anything. I don't really want to go into this. But then I was told two pretty circumstantial things about the ranch [where Deng had been staying, according to Vanity Fair]. I was in Australia. When I got back, I naturally asked the staff, and it opened up. That's the story. And then, you know, a week later I filed. As soon as I could find a lawyer. You're moving on now and buying real estate. You bought Moraga, a new ranch, plus a new apartment in New York. Well, it's like turning a new leaf. I saw the story in the Wall Street Journal Mansion section about Moraga and realized that I had met the owner 20 or 25 years ago with President Reagan at a social party, although he wasn't a very political person. He was dying because he was 93 and had very bad emphysema. And he wanted to sell it to someone who said, ""I will keep it going and not subdivide this land."" The owner was Tom Jones, a former CEO of Northrop, which became Northrop Grumman. He had a fascinating life. At 19, he [worked on designing] dive-bombers, which sank the Japanese and saved Australia. Before his retirement he invested in the stealth bomber. So I wanted to talk about his career at Northrop Grumman. He wanted to talk about how to grow grapes and get better wine. So we formed a real friendship. I expected him to live a bit longer, but I said he could stay in the house. I've now taken possession of the house. I have hired a modest decorator. I just want it to be rustic. You have another house near Moraga, don't you? Yes. I have a beautiful house, which the family is screaming about me selling. I don't want two houses a couple of miles from each other. Is the other house on the market? It was, and I took it off. On the pleas of James and Lachlan. Did they say, ""That's our house and you can't sell it""? I said, ""Put your money up."" But I haven't seen it. And how did you find your New York apartment? Natalie [Ravitz, his chief of staff] found it. I was away. I'd been ill. I had a very bad month in January and February. I had a fall in San Francisco. I fell on my head. It was just stupidity in a hotel room. I'd put on some boots to go for a hike around San Francisco to be shown by Natalie, and I went down and hit my head very hard. And I got, I guess you'd call it, a hair fracture across my spine. I landed on a carpet, but on my head. I've never had such pain in my life. A friend of mine sent a friend of his, a neurosurgeon, down to see me, who quickly said I didn't have any concussion. After that, I just went to my ranch and rested for three weeks. You were lucky. When will your New York apartment be ready? Ask the decorator. I told him four months, and he said eight. And everyone tells me it's 12. It's like James Cameron making a movie. Yeah. I will be fairly modest, to start with. I'm not going to put in great antiques or have major things that take a long time to do. I'll buy nice, not-too-modern furniture. But it's a modern place. It's very high. What floor? On 58, 59, and 60. It's a triplex. And I assume that my two daughters will each have their own rooms for the first time in their lives. And they're decorating them, they think. This story is from the April 28, 2014 issue of Fortu Attachments: image001.gif (125 Bytes)",Private

The latest Hillary smackdown isn’t about money, it’s about manipulation. The public is being played and there’s not a peep of protest from the peanut gallery. I watched the Diane Sawyer interview and didn’t feel a frisson of unfairness when Hillary said that she and Bill left the White House “dead broke.” “We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education. You know, it was not easy. Bill has worked really hard and it's been amazing to me. He has worked very hard, first of all we had to pay off all our debts which was, you know, had you to make double the money because of obviously taxes and then pay off the debts and get us houses and take care of family members.” Sounded reasonable. If more is going out than coming in, you have to deal with it, whether you’re in the one percent or Mitt’s 47 percent. With more than $11-million in debt Hillary was simply stating a fact-- something today’s reporters might try more often. And that’s the bigger picture people are missing. Journalists and their pretenders no longer report the facts and leave the rest to us. They feed us the whole package including analysis, interpretation, opinion and conclusions -- and we swallow it. The truth is, even before Hillary said a word, reporters were licking their lips, laying in wait for something, anything, that would push the public’s buttons...the better to ratchet up ratings and pump up profits. From newspapers to broadcast networks, from cable to commentators, across the wide spectrum of news hunters and gatherers came a chorus of copycat critics singing the same tune: Hillary flubbed, Hillary stumbled, Hillary is entitled and out of touch with ordinary people. ‘Monkey see, monkey do’ used to be a put down. Now it’s standard practice among news professionals. Bill O’Reilly chimed in saying that Hillary’s wealth makes her ineligible to talk about income inequality. “It’s not going to play with the folks,"" he pronounced from his one percent perch. Well, as one of those folks, it played fine with me. CNN’s Carol Costello added violins to the media symphony. “Writing a speech then delivering it for $200,000 takes some brain work,” she wrote, “but it’s a lot easier than digging ditches. Or rushing home after an eight-hour shift at Walmart to cook dinner, take care of the kids, do the laundry and then do it all again six hours later.” (Oh, please! Really hard work is getting top grades in school, getting accepted by the best law school in the country and working your butt off to push for equal pay for women, paid maternity leave and getting a do-nothing congress to raise the minimum wage for everyone, including those ditch diggers and Walmart mothers.) So what are people to think? Well, we don’t have to think. We’re off the hook. We can sit on the couch, feed on the media frenzy and regurgitate what we’ve swallowed. Or...we can step up to the plate and listen to what our own gut is telling us. It’s been said, wisely, that ‘Money doesn’t change you, it reveals you.’ And, by any measure, Hillary Clinton has been revealed as a smart, hardworking, accomplished public servant. That’s her bottom line and it hasn’t changed with her financial fortunes. What’s that expression? Actions speak louder than words. And the American people know it. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, in a clear case of wishful thinking, said that all the stories about Clinton’s wealth are giving Americans “Hillary fatigue.” He got it half right. It’s the other “H” that’s wearing people down—hype fatigue. So just once I’d like a presidential debate or a high profile interview --whether it’s Hillary Clinton, Chris Christie, Rand Paul or President Obama -- to end without the always relentless, often agendized media overkill and analysis. With the scent of election season already in the air, it’s time. It’s time for Americans to tune out anyone’s talking points, to take a pass on pundits and pollsters and to decide for themselves what they think and feel. In other words, it’s time for them to make their own hard choices.",Private

My name is Sean Burke and I am currently a senior at the University of Pennsylvania with a major in the History and Sociology of Sciences with a concentration in public health. Michael Lynton gave me your contact information and let me know that you might be a good person to talk to about a career in public health. I am very interested in working in this field after graduation, with the goal of eventually going to business school and working in health care management or hospital consutling. I have sent in my application for a hospital consulting analyst position at the Advisory Board Company in D.C. I also have a phone interview with RAND tomorrow morning, hoping to work in their D.C. office (and stay on the east coast to be close by to friends and family, although Santa Monica wouldn't be so bad either!) I know you are probably very busy, but I was wondering if you had any advice at all about this career path, or potentially any ideas for other places I could apply?

"Save Our Senate! Join President Obama and Support the Democratic Party's Majority in the Midterms! Moving Forward in 2014 Summer Events Friends: For those of you who sent me ideas regarding messaging and how to improve voter turnout, thank you! Lots of good ideas! One thing that has become patently clear this week is that if we do not keep the Senate, Impeachment will be the Republicans' first order of business. It does not matter there are no grounds. Remember: they have been talking impeachment from Day 1. This simply cannot happen. There is so much that can still be accomplished if we take back the House and keep the Senate. So your support is even more important than ever! A quick update. In addition to the July 23rd event in L.A. at Shondra Rhimes home with President Obama, there will be a roundtable discussion the next day, July 24th, at the home of Michael and Jolene Rapino in LA. The roundtable event is limited to 30 guests and will be a one hour of off-the-record conversation with the President. I attended one last year, and it was amazing. No question was off limits, and the President’s grasp of a far-ranging list of questions was absolutely amazing. I hope you can come to one of these events! If you have any events that you would like me to list please forward the info to me and copy Fred Ascher at fredascher@gmail.com. Thanks so much!

"Obama Enlists 9 Allies to Help in the Battle Against ISISNEWPORT, Wales — President Obama escalated the American response to the marauding Islamic State in Iraq and Syria on Friday, recruiting at least nine allies to help crush the organization and offering the outlines of a coordinated military strategy that echoes the war on terror developed by his predecessor, George W. Bush, more than a decade ago.In his most expansive comments to date about how the United States and its friends could defeat ISIS, a once-obscure group of Sunni militants that has now upended the Middle East and overshadowed Al Qaeda, Mr. Obama said the effort would rely on American airstrikes against its leaders and positions, strengthen the moderate Syrian rebel groups to reclaim ground lost to ISIS, and enlist friendly governments in the region to join the fight.While the president’s aides maintained that he has not yet decided to authorize airstrikes in Syria — which he has already done on a limited basis in Iraq — Mr. Obama likened his developing strategy on ISIS to the American effort against Al Qaeda in Pakistan’s tribal regions, which has relied heavily on airstrikes.Mr. Obama has been under enormous pressure to articulate a way to counter ISIS, which has proclaimed itself an Islamic caliphate that knows no borders and has demonstrated ruthless behavior, including the videotaped beheadings of two Americans. After creating a political tempest by saying last week that his administration lacked a strategy, Mr. Obama sought on Friday to portray himself as spearheading the effort.Video | Obama: The Goal Is to ‘Dismantle’ ISIS The president commented on the battle against the Islamic State during a news conference at the NATO summit in Wales.But in so doing, the president risks further entangling the American military in exactly the type of costly foreign conflict he has long sought to escape. And his administration has been unable to explain how he can vanquish ISIS without indirectly aiding President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, regarded by the administration as an odious leader who must resign.Nonetheless, Mr. Obama’s comments, made at the conclusion of a NATO summit meeting here, were in effect a significant expansion of his earlier assessments of the ISIS threat — simply by offering a direct comparison to the strategy against Qaeda militants.“You initially push them back, you systematically degrade their capabilities, you narrow their scope of action, you slowly shrink the space, the territory that they may control, you take out their leadership,” Mr. Obama said at a news conference here. “And over time, they are not able to conduct the same kinds of terrorist attacks as they once could.”He said that “we are going to degrade and ultimately defeat ISIL, the same way that we have gone after Al Qaeda,” using an alternate acronym for ISIS. He drew the analogy to Pakistan as an example of how the United States can go to war against militants while limiting the number of American ground combat troops.Mr. Obama spoke after aides had unveiled what Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called the “core coalition” to fight the ISIS militants, the outcome of a hastily organized meeting on the sidelines of the NATO summit talks. Diplomats and defense officials from the United States, Britain, France, Australia, Canada, Germany, Turkey, Italy, Poland and Denmark huddled to devise a two-pronged strategy: strengthening allies on the ground in Iraq and Syria, while bombing Sunni militants from the air.“There is no containment policy for ISIL,” Secretary of State John Kerry said at the start of the meeting. “They’re an ambitious, avowed, genocidal, territorial-grabbing, caliphate-desiring quasi state with an irregular army, and leaving them in some capacity intact anywhere would leave a cancer in place that will ultimately come back to haunt us.”But he and other officials made clear that at the moment, any ground combat troops would come from either Iraqi security forces and Kurdish pesh merga fighters in Iraq, or the moderate Syrian rebels opposed to President Assad in Syria. “Obviously I think that’s a red line for everybody here: no boots on the ground,” Mr. Kerry said.For Mr. Obama, assembling a coalition to fight ISIS is particularly important to a president whose initial arrival on the global stage was centered around his opposition to the war in Iraq. He is loath to be viewed as going it alone now that he has been dragged back into a combat role in the same country.“Getting sucked deeply back into another set of violent conflicts in the Middle East runs against the grain and the very DNA of this administration,” said Brian Katulis, a national security expert with the Center for American Progress, a research organization with close ties to the Obama administration. “But the stunning actions by ISIS this summer has been a wake-up call.”Even as Mr. Obama is weighing airstrikes in Syria, he and his aides have been questioning what to do afterward, especially since targeting ISIS in Syria will help Mr. Assad.An administration official said the reasons for assembling a coalition went beyond any political cover that such an alliance might provide with a war-weary American public. For one thing, the official said, certain countries bring expertise, like Britain and Australia in special operations, Jordan in intelligence and Saudi Arabia in financing. American officials are hoping to expand the coalition to many countries, particularly in the region. Obama administration officials said privately that in addition to the participants at the meeting Friday, the United States was hoping to get quiet intelligence help about the Sunni militants from Jordan. Its leader, King Abdullah II, was attending the Wales summit meeting.United States officials said they also expected Saudi Arabia to contribute to funding moderate Syrian rebel groups. In addition, Yousef Al Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates ambassador to the United States, said in a statement this week that the Emirates stood ready to join the fight against ISIS. “No one has more at stake than the U.A.E. and other moderate countries in the region that have rejected the regressive Islamist creed and embraced a different, forward-looking path,” the ambassador said.Enlisting support from Sunni populations in Syria and Iraq is crucial, experts said, because airstrikes alone will not suffice.Matthew G. Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center in Washington, sought to define more clearly what destroying ISIS would actually mean on the ground.""From a counterterrorism standpoint, understand that it doesn’t mean eradicating every single person aligned with the group,"" Mr. Olsen said. ""We need to be realistic about that.""And like the comprehensive strategy to combat Al Qaeda that has taken years to develop and carry out, Mr. Olsen and other counterterrorism officials said on Friday that destroying the threat from ISIS could take a long time. Even if successful, they said, such a strategy would require maintaining pressure on any remnants of the group.Administration officials said support for moderate rebels in Syria is critical. This summer, President Obama set aside $500 million to train and support vetted members of the moderate opposition to Mr. Assad. Officials say they expect Congress to approve that request next month.But even after that money is approved, American officials will face obstacles in strengthening the Free Syrian Army, the moderates of choice for the United States. “This is going to take months,” one Defense Department official said on Friday.Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.",Private

"OBAMA IS JUST 'TICKLING' ISIS, SYRIAN REBELS SAYU.S. airstrikes against ISIS, even if they extend into Syria as several Obama administration officials are signaling, don’t have a chance of destroying the terror group, moderate political and rebel leaders inside the country are cautioning. They have told The Daily Beast that air strikes will only make things worse unless there’s a coordinated plan to defeat ISIS.For the Free Syrian Army, the Obama administration’s recent bluster about possibly using U.S. military force to strike ISIS inside Syria is too little, too late. On the one hand, moderate rebels say they can’t prepare for U.S. military intervention in Syria because they don’t have confidence President Obama will make good on his threat. On the other hand, if Obama does expand the U.S. air war against ISIS into Syria without a real plan to combat it on the ground, the American intervention will do more harm than good.“Airstrikes against ISIS inside Syria will not be helpful. Airstrikes will not get rid of ISIS. Airstrikes are like just tickling ISIS,” Hussam Al Marie, the spokesman for the FSA in northern Syria, told The Daily Beast. “ISIS is not a real state that you can attack and destroy; they are thugs who are spread all over the east of Syria in the desert. And when they are in the cities, they are using civilian buildings. So airstrikes will not be enough to get rid of these terrorists and at the same time, they might hit civilians. That’s the problem.”Several leaders and representatives of the Free Syrian Army, the Syrian Military Council, and the Syrian Opposition Coalition told The Daily Beast in a series of interviews that the Western powers’ support for the fight against ISIS has been ad hoc, disjointed, and unenthusiastic ever since the FSA and ISIS began fighting in earnest at the beginning of this year. As a result, ISIS got stronger and the FSA was left weak and fractured.Led by the United States, international military operations coordination cells in Turkey and Jordan have given meager and inconsistent support to FSA brigades fighting ISIS all over northern and eastern Syria, leaving the moderate rebels outmanned and outgunned all year. Meanwhile, ISIS amassed resources, money, and heavy weapons brought back as spoils from their military victories in Iraq.“We were very clear that we wanted to cooperate with the Americans. They didn’t listen. They paid a price.”Now, following the murder of American journalist James Foleyin Syria, the United States and European countries are scrambling to play catch-up and figure out a strategy to disrupt and then somehow defeat ISIS. Two FSA leaders said that in the past week, with Foley dead and the city of Aleppo about to fall, the West has been calling on the FSA to fight ISIS and again holding out the prospect of more robust international support, including U.S. airstrikes.“If you come after Americans, we’re going to come after you, wherever you are,” Deputy National Security Adviser for Communications Ben Rhodes said Friday. “We’re actively considering what’s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and we’re not going to be restricted by borders.”But the FSA has heard this tune before, and its leaders are skeptical that the American cavalry is on the way or that it will do any good.“The ISIS killing of James Foley and the threatening of the other American journalists reflects that America didn’t pay much attention to the threat and growth of ISIS inside Syria,” said Iyad Shamsi, the commander of the FSA Eastern Front, in an interview. “We were very clear that we wanted to cooperate with the Americans. They didn’t listen. They paid a price.”Shamsi led the FSA brigade in the Syrian city of Der al Zour, the largest city on the Syria-Iraq border. ISIS took over the city in July, after months of desperate warnings from the FSA to Western countries went unanswered. Now Shamsi and other FSA leaders are warning their Western contacts not to repeat that mistake in Aleppo, the biggest front against ISIS now.“Since a week ago, now we are getting a lot of communication from Western powers saying, ‘What can we do to help you against ISIS?’ They ask us go to fight ISIS and say ‘We will support you,’” he said. “From our experience we can see that when ISIS gets near the Turkish border, they are very serious. Whenever the fighting moves eastward toward the Iraqi border, they are not serious at all.”FSA forces are nearly surrounded in Aleppo, squeezed by ISIS in the north and the regime in the south. If ISIS is able to cut off Aleppo’s access to the Turkish border, Syria’s second-largest city will be cut off from humanitarian aid and the moderate rebels will lose one of their most important links to vital supplies.“ISIS is attempting to retake Aleppo, and the FSA is locked in a desperate battle against them,” said Oubai Shahbandar, spokesman for the Syrian Opposition Coalition in Washington. “If ISIS succeeds, it’s going to significantly endanger humanitarian aid and you’re going to see more atrocities, and you will absolutely see more kidnappings.”Early this year, when ISIS first threatened to take over northern Aleppo, the international powers through the coordination center in Turkey sent small arms and ammunition to the FSA, which pushed back ISIS. The FSA even liberated an ISIS prison inside the children’s hospital and freed 30 civilians, including two Syrian journalists.But when the FSA then took the fight to other parts of Syria, including near Raqqa, where ISIS has its stronghold, the flow of military aid to the moderate rebels just stopped. This time around, small arms won’t be enough: ISIS now has heavy weapons and heavy armor. To be sure, the FSA has been asking for advanced weapons for years to fight the regime, but now its leaders say they need them to combat ISIS, as well.“The FSA has been fighting against ISIS since the beginning of this year,” said Al Marie. “We continue to fight them. The problem now is that they came back to the fight with sophisticated weapons, weapons they stole from the Americans. We are losing our brave fighters on the front against ISIS. We’re just asking the West for some cooperation, some support to be able to fight these monsters and free our lands with our hands. That’s what we want.”While Obama administration officials often talk about the lack of good intelligence about ISIS, the FSA says it has lots of information about ISIS, including about its foreign fighters and foreign hostages. The United States didn’t consult with the FSA before launching the unsuccessful July raid to free Foley. But if the Obama administration wants to find the other Western hostages, it might consider working with the FSA, Al Marie said. For example, he added, many highly valuable Western hostages are held in an ISIS prison beneath a dam near Raqqa.“Working with the FSA is always better. We are Syrians, we know how and where and when to move in this country,” said Al Marie. “We live on this land. We know it. We know its geography, its tribes, its people. We are the most capable people to identify where the foreign fighters are. But we need support.”For members of the Syrian opposition in Washington, America’s policy to fight ISIS in Syria has to consist of much more than helping the FSA; the opposition is calling on Washington to do more to support civil society in Syria and combat ISIS’s ideology as well as its military prowess.“If the United States is serious about fighting ISIS, and not just a policy of containment, it will require a robust strategy in Syria,” said Bassam Barabandi, a Syrian opposition activist at People Demand Change, an American NGO.But the moderate rebels are so disillusioned with the Obama administration that they are not counting on Obama to change his policy of non-intervention any time soon. Last month, Obamasaid in an interview that the entire idea the Syrian rebel army could defeat the Syrian regime was a “fantasy.”“We are disappointed,” said Al Marie. “We have lost a lot in this revolution. More than 190,000 people were killed in this revolution and no one cared. Now they want to intervene in Syria because of one American killed. Obama said, ‘We are helping the Iraqis help themselves.’ What about the Syrian people, who have been trying to help themselves for more than three years? We are still waiting, we are hoping someone will hear our voices, someone will recognize our right to freedom, justice, and dignity.”",Private

(""Third Ukraine E.O."" or ""E.O."").[1] The text of the E.O. is available here. The Third Ukraine E.O. further expands on Executive Order 13660,[2] signed on March 6, 2014, and Executive Order 13661,[3] signed on March 16, 2014, which target former Ukrainian officials and current Russian Federation officials who threaten the peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as persons who operate in the arms or related sectors in the Russian Federation. President Obama issued these three Executive Orders in response to the recent political upheaval in Ukraine, including Russia's movement of troops into the Crimea, the March 16, 2014 Crimean referendum on seceding from Ukraine, and Russia's subsequent annexation of the peninsula. The Third Ukraine E.O. significantly expands the scope of the prior two Executive Orders by providing the authority to block the property of persons who operate in certain sectors of Russia's economy, including financial services, energy, metals and mining, engineering, and defense and related materiel.[4] In addition, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC"") at the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated twenty Russian individuals and one Russian bank (Bank Rossiya), all of whom were found to threaten the peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine.[5] These individuals and Bank Rossiya were all designated pursuant to Executive Order 13661, however, not the Third Ukraine E.O.,[6] meaning they were designated as officials of the Government of the Russian Federation or as operating in the arms or related sector in the Russian Federation, or for providing support to the foregoing. Sixteen of these individuals are Russian Government officials, including the head of Russia's military intelligence service (the GRU), President Vladimir Putin's Chief of Staff, and four members of Putin's inner circle, including the personal banker for senior officials of the Russian Federation, Yuri Kovalchuk.[7] Bank Rossiya is regarded as the personal bank for many senior Russian Government officials, and maintains multiple correspondent relationships with banks in the United States.[8] It is now unlawful for any U.S. person or company to do business with the designated parties, and any property in which the designated parties have an interest must be blocked. As the crisis continues to unfold, OFAC may continue to designate former Ukrainian and current Russian officials, as well as persons in various sectors of the Russian economy. In addition, OFAC may begin undertaking enforcement actions against U.S. companies who violate the prohibitions set forth in the three Executive Orders. U.S. companies should pay close attention to further announcements by OFAC and ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Executive Orders. The European Union (EU) has also issued an additional list of twelve individuals identified as having taken actions that undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.[9] As with the previous list of sanctioned persons released on March 17, 2014,[10] these newly sanctioned individuals are now subject to a travel ban and freeze of their EU assets. Six of these twelve individuals were previously designated by the U.S. as subject to sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 13661, while the other six have not yet been sanctioned by the U.S. Reports in the media indicate that the EU will be taking a closer look at issuing broader so-called ""Phase 3"" sanctions that would involve restrictions on energy, trade, and financial relations with Russia, if Russian threats or movements in the eastern part of Ukraine increase.[11] U.S. persons with operations in Europe or who are otherwise subject to EU legal authority should screen for these newly sanctioned individuals and those previously sanctioned by the EU to ensure that they are complying with the EU sanctions that apply to these persons, in addition to screening for individuals designated pursuant to the U.S. Executive Orders. Key Provisions of the Executive Order The Third Ukraine E.O. significantly expands the President's authority to target Russian persons, regardless of whether they are determined to threaten the peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The E.O. blocks all property and interests in property in the United States, or in the possession or control of any U.S. person or company, of any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to operate in such sectors of the Russian Federation economy as may be determined, such as financial services, energy, metals and mining, engineering, and defense and related materiel.[12] The scope of the Third Ukraine E.O. is expansive; while it lists certain sectors of the Russian economy where persons could be targeted, the language is sufficiently broad to permit the sanctioning of Russian persons in any sector of the Russian economy. The E.O. also blocks the property of any person who materially assists, sponsors, or provides financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this Executive Order.[13] In addition, the E.O. blocks the property of any person determined to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this Executive Order.[14] The E.O. suspends entry into the United States of persons designated pursuant to this Executive Order.[15] Recommendations The Third Ukraine E.O., the additional designations under Executive Order 13661, and the EU listings continue U.S. and EU attempts to increase pressure on Russia and resolve the political crisis in Ukraine. As we noted in our two recent client alerts on this matter, whether the crisis deepens or relaxes will likely determine whether the United States and the European Union impose additional economic sanctions on Russia.[16] Looking ahead, U.S. companies should be aware of at least four potential developments. First, U.S. companies should ensure that they are in compliance with these new Executive Orders and have blocked the property of any designated persons. U.S. companies should also closely monitor any additional designations, Executive Orders, legislation, or regulations. Given the breadth of the Third Ukraine E.O., U.S. companies should focus compliance efforts on those sectors identified in the Order, but also on the Russian economy more broadly. Second, U.S. companies should determine the scope of their relationship with Bank Rossiya's affiliates.[17] Under the Executive Order, any person determined to be owned or controlled by a blocked person may be sanctioned. In addition, however, OFAC guidance[18] states that if a blocked person owns more than 50% of an entity, that entity is considered owned by the blocked person and its property must also be blocked, whether or not the entity itself has been separately sanctioned under the Executive Order. Under this ""50% Rule,"" U.S. companies cannot do business with those financial institutions in which Bank Rossiya has a 50% or greater interest, whether or not the financial institution has been designated. Bank Rossiya holds large stakes in OAO Sogaz Insurance Group, one of Russia's largest insurance companies, and in National Media Group. In addition, Bank Rossiya controls Solinbank, and Investitsionny Soyuz, while Arkady and Boris Rotenberg together own a majority of InvestCapitalBank (also spelled InvestKapitalBank) and SMP Bank. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher attorneys are currently reviewing the data concerning other entities that might be controlled. While OFAC has informally suggested that conducting transactions with some of these entities may be permitted, U.S. companies should proceed with caution and reach out to our attorneys if they have concerns about whether they are transacting with a blocked entity. Third, Russia has already sanctioned U.S. officials.[19] While these sanctions are limited, if the United States continues designating Russian persons, Russian economic retaliation against U.S. businesses may occur. Fourth, while Vladimir Putin recently announced that he would refrain from imposing further sanctions on the United States and the European Union,[20] U.S. businesses should not assume that Russia will not economically retaliate in the future. A significant likelihood still exists that Russia will target U.S. and European companies as the crisis continues. _____ \l ""BM__ftnref1"" [1] Exec.

The Friends co-creator and her composer husband Michael Skloff will host President Barack Obama at their LA County home for a DNC fundraiser on September 9, Deadline has learned. Described as a “roundtable” discussion by one insider, the one-hour event (take a look at the invite here) comes at a price of $32,400 per guest. In what is being set up as smallish gathering, Obama will take direct questions from the big money ticket buyers. A long time Obama and DNC supporter, Kauffman most recently donated $50,000 to the President’s second Inauguration. The visit in two weeks comes just over three weeks after the President’s last trip to LA when he appeared on The Tonight Show and had a private dinner with DreamWorks Animation boss Jeffrey Katzenberg. That August 7 visit was one of the few times Obama had been in town and not attending a fundraiser. On June 7, the President was the marquee attraction at the two sold-out DNC fundraisers at former News Corp No. 2 and now independent mogul Peter Chernin’s house. With tickets ranging from $10,000 to $32,400, the event saw Disney boss Bob Iger, Fox Film chief Jim Gianopulos there along with Haim Saban, StarTrek/Star Wars director JJ Abrams and his wife Katie McGrath and HBO’s Mike Lombardo and his partner Sonny Ward.

"Obama just announced: BREAKING: President Obama calls for action against crushing student loan debt >> Sign on to support President Obama's call to action: Moments ago, President Obama endorsed the Elizabeth Warren-John Tierney plan to effectively lower student loan debt by allowing people to refinance their loans. Add your name to support the plan: Sign Your Name >> President Obama just announced TWO pieces of GREAT news: 1. President Obama is taking executive action to expand his “Pay As You Earn” student loan program to up to five million more Americans. That means millions of college graduates won’t be forced to pay more than 10% of their monthly income on student loan bills. 2. President Obama went one step further -- he called on Congress to pass the Elizabeth Warren-John Tierney bill allowing graduates to refinance their student loans, and get cheaper rates. The measure is paid for by making millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share of taxes. You can bet Republicans in Congress aren’t eager to support raising taxes on their billionaire backers -- even if it helps college graduates struggling under crushing student loan debt. That’s why we need to put the pressure on today -- a vote could come as soon as this week.

"Alert - President Obama Signs Executive Order Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine and Designates Russian and Former Ukrainian Officials Gibson Dunn Alert gd_banner Home · Practices · Lawyers · Diversity · Pro Bono · Firm News · Publications _____ President Obama Signs Executive Order Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine and Designates Russian and Former Ukrainian Officials _____ March 18, 2014 To Our Clients and Friends: In continued response to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, on March 17, 2014, President Obama signed an Executive Order ""Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine."" (""Second Ukraine E.O."" or ""E.O."").[1] The text of the E.O. is available here. The Second Ukraine E.O. expands on Executive Order 13660, signed on March 6, 2014, which targets persons threatening the peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine.[2] President Obama issued both Executive Orders in response to the recent political upheaval in Ukraine, including Russia's movement of troops into the Crimea and the March 16, 2014 Crimean referendum on seceding from Ukraine. The Second Ukraine E.O. expands the scope of Executive Order 13660 by providing the authority to block the property of officials of the Government of the Russian Federation and persons who operate in the Russian arms sector.[3] In addition, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC"") at the U.S. Department of the Treasury also designated eleven individuals found to threaten the peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine,[4] including former officials from Ukraine and current officials from the Russian Federation. Four individuals were designated pursuant to Executive Order 13660, and seven individuals were designated pursuant to the Second Ukraine E.O. Notable persons designated include former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. It is now unlawful for any U.S. person or company to do business with the designated parties, and any property in which the designated parties have an interest must be blocked. Depending on how the crisis in Ukraine continues to unfold, OFAC may designate more persons and undertake enforcement actions against U.S. companies who violate the prohibitions set forth in both Executive Orders. U.S. companies should pay close attention to further announcements by OFAC and ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Executive Orders. The European Union (EU) also issued a list of twenty-one individuals it has identified as responsible for actions which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, as well as persons and entities associated with them.[5] These individuals have been targeted with a travel ban and a freeze with respect to their EU assets. Although the list of EU targets overlaps in part with the list of sanctioned individuals identified in today's announcement by the U.S. government, it also contains names that are not included in the U.S. designations. Likewise, the U.S. target list also includes individuals who have not yet been sanctioned by the EU. U.S. persons with operations in Europe or who are otherwise subject to EU legal authority should take care to comply with the new EU sanctions regarding Ukraine, in addition to screening for individuals designated pursuant to the two U.S. Executive Orders. Key Provisions of the Executive Order The Second Ukraine E.O. expands the President's authority to target persons who undermine the democratic institutions and the peace and stability of Ukraine. Most notably, the E.O. blocks all property and interests in property in the United States, or in the possession or control of any U.S. person or company, of any person listed in the annex to the E.O., or determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be an official of the Government of the Russian Federation or to operate in the arms or related sector in the Russian Federation.[6] It also blocks the property of any person determined to be owned or controlled by--or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of--a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation or a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the E.O.[7] In addition, it blocks the property of any person determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for--or goods or services to or in support of--a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation or a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the E.O.[8] The E.O. defines the term ""Government of the Russian Federation"" as ""the Government of the Russian Federation, any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including the Central Bank of the Government of the Russian Federation, and any person owned, or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, the Government of the Russian Federation.""[9] Notably, the E.O. does not define who a senior official of the Government of the Russian Federation is, or what constitutes the arms or a related sector.[10] In addition, the E.O. suspends entry into the United States of persons designated pursuant to this Executive Order.[11] Recommendations The Second Ukraine E.O. and the EU listings are further steps by the United States and the European Union to bring economic pressure to bear in helping resolve the political crisis in Ukraine. As we noted in our recent client alert on this matter, whether the crisis deepens or relaxes will likely determine whether the United States and the European Union take additional steps to impose economic sanctions on Russia.[12] Looking ahead, U.S. companies should be aware of at least two potential developments. First, U.S. companies should ensure that they are in compliance with these new Executive Orders and have blocked the property of any designated persons. U.S. companies should also closely monitor any additional designations, Executive Orders, legislation, or regulations. Second, Russia has indicated that it may penalize U.S. businesses following the imposition of U.S. sanctions. Given the designation of officials of the Government of the Russian Federation, Russian economic retaliation against U.S. businesses is now substantially more likely.

"Â Moving Forward in 2014September and October EventsÂ Â Â Â â€œSix years after the historic election of Barack Obama, we are living through a revolution in American politics, and the elections taking place in less than 50 days are a key moment in that ongoing revolution. Obamaâ€™s election in 2008 announced the arrival of a new demographic majority in American politics, comprised of People of Color and Progressive Whites. In many ways, absent the euphoria of 2008, the 2012 election was an even more important statement about the staying power of the New American Majority.Â As we saw in 2010, however, when the New Majority stays home, we lose. If we want to see different results come November, we have to find a way to turn out New Majority voters in the midterms. If we make the right investments in 2014 â€“ targeted, grassroots voter engagement, elevating progressive leaders, and focusing our energy on key races â€“ we will hold the Senate and make progress in the House and in representation at the statewide level.Â If we can hold the Senate, make progress in the House, and elevate progressive leaders in strategic states, we can take huge steps toward generating lasting political power for the progressive New American Majority. We all need to dig in and do what is in our power to maximize this moment to further progressive interests and foster justice and equality in both the short term and the long haul.â€Steve PhillipsÂ Click here to read the rest of Steve Phillipsâ€™ analysis on how we can do this.

This is where the following two groups can make a difference. I hope you will support them.Â Senior Votes Count!:Â They show up in the ""on"" years and the ""off"" years. But they often donâ€™t show up at the polls as well informed as they should be. And way too often they vote against their own self-interest, in favor of candidates who threaten cherished senior programs like Medicare and Social Security! Seniors are statistically the most reliable segment of the population to turn out in every election cycle. So moving the needle just a few points in the direction of candidates who will fight to protect and preserve the benefits seniors have earned throughout their working lifetimes can easily be the deciding factor in any close race. That's why a new Political Action Committee calledÂ SENIOR VOTES COUNT!Â Think of the organization as an ""Emily's List"" for seniors!Â The principals of this new, one-of-a-kind organization include veterans of hundreds of campaigns, some with ""celebrity"" clout, and experts with vast experience on issues that impact seniors. My friend Jon Bauman â€œThe Bowzer from Sha Na Naâ€ is one of the founders. They can make the difference in the kind of Congress and state governments we have moving forward. For the 2014 election cycle, your contribution will be used first and foremost to send this expert principal staff directly into key U.S. House, Senate and Gubernatorial races where they have endorsed candidates. Remember, seniors will show up at the polls, so they need to know which candidate is working in their best interests! Senior votes will count in 2014! So please support SENIOR VOTES COUNT!Â Contribute now to help fund Senior Votes! groundbreaking work around the country!Â VoteRiders:Â Voter ID is the civil rights struggle of our time. Millions of Americans â€“ from veterans to the elderly to young adults to women - are losing their right to vote because of voter ID laws.Â Knowing that millions of potential voters may be disenfranchised by the increasing number of stringent voter ID laws, my friend Kathleen Unger decided to take action by creatingÂ VoteRiders.Â VoteRiders is a non-partisan, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure that all citizens are able to exercise their right to vote. Through resources and media exposure, VoteRiders supports on-the-ground organizations that assist citizens to secure their voter ID and inspires local volunteers and communities to sustain such programs and galvanize others to emulate these efforts.Â VoteRiders is the only organization whose sole mission is to protect the right to vote by helping voters meet the requirements of their state's voter ID law. Your tax-deductible contribution will enable VoteRiders to build a nationwide Voter ID Network of organizations and individuals who support our efforts so citizens can vote.Â Here are some examples of how your donation can be used:Â $25:Â Â Â Â Â Â Copy of a birth certificate$125:Â Â Â Â Copy of a birth certificate for five voters$500:Â Â Â Â Document fees for one Voter ID Clinic$2,000:Â Partner Organization costs for one Voter ID Clinic$5,000:Â Communications including media exposure for voter ID outreach in one stateÂ VoteRiders is already on the ground in key states and needs your help to ensure anyone who wants to vote can vote.Â And 100% of your contribution is tax deductible!!Â Click here to contribute to VoteRiders.Â Â Finally, there are some amazing progressives that are running office and I strongly encourage you to support. I have met each one of them and recommend them without hesitation.Â Governor Dan Malloy:Â Dan Malloy is running for his second term as Governor of Connecticut.Â Click here to read more about Dan.Â Under Dan Malloyâ€™s progressive leadership, Connecticut became the first state in the nation to pass a minimum wage increase to $10.10 an hour and to pass legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave to workers. Dan Malloy passed historic gun safety legislation, bipartisan education reform and a first of its kind comprehensive energy strategy. Crime is at one of the lowest points in decades, and Connecticutâ€™s health care exchange more than doubled its enrollment goals for signing up residents for quality, affordable health care.

"Obama just announced: President Obama just announced some GREAT news: The Affordable Care Act has reached 8 million Americans signed up for affordable, quality, private health insurance!!! It’s been a long road, and President Obama's faced ugly obstruction from Republicans every step of the way. But he kept on fighting to make this incredible day a possibility. For that, we want to say thanks: Will you click here to automatically sign your name and thank President Obama for making the Affordable Care Act a success? Thank President Obama For the Affordable Care Act! Those 8 million sign-ups don’t even include: 3 million young adults who were able to stay on their parents’ plan. 3 million more people enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. 5 million people on ACA plans bought outside the Marketplace. And here’s one more fun fact to share with all those Republican Obamacare-haters out there: 35% of sign-ups on the Marketplace are under 35 years old, and 28% are between 18 and 34 years old -- virtually the same percentage seen under Romneycare. So if you want to thank President Obama for standing up for us, today's the day to do it! SIGN YOUR NAME:",Private

"Does anyone know him? From: Weaver, Keith Sent: Friday, August 29, 2014 9:29 AMTo: Weil, LeahSubject: Deadline: No Hollywood Credits For Obama IP Czar Nominee FYI – He still needs to be confirmed by the Senate, but I’ve reached out to invite him here, etc.. Will keep you posted.Deadline: No Hollywood Credits For Obama IP Czar Nomineeby The Deadline Team August 28, 2014 3:43pm It’s been a year since the U.S. had an Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator, and now the president has proposed a new one. Danny Marti, a partner at the D.C. law firm Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton, was nominated today by President Obama to become the nation’s second-ever IP czar. He would fill the post left vacant when Victoria Espinel stepped down in August 2013.“We applaud the Administration’s intent to nominate Danny Marti as U.S. Intellectual Property Enforcement Coordinator,” MPAA chief Chris Dodd said today in a statement after the White House made the announcement. “The IPEC plays a critical role in promoting intellectual property as a driver of our nation’s culture and economy. Danny’s impressive record of commitment to enforcing IP rights in the Internet age makes him a particularly strong choice. We urge the Senate to confirm him without delay for this important job.”Marti specializes in the protection, management, and enforcement of IP assets in the U.S. and abroad. According to his Kilpatrick Townsend bio, he has not been involved in any Hollywood-centric cases, serving as lead counsel in everything from negotiating stadium naming rights to repping firms including Adidas and American Eagle Outfitters over trademark and copyright infringement. Super Lawyers magazine listed Marti as a “Super Lawyer” for IP in D.C. each of the past two years, and he also was named as an “IP Star” by Managing Intellectual Property magazine two years running. Espinel last summer spearheaded the Joint Strategic Plan On Intellectual Property Enforcement, voluntary initiatives to fight piracy that drew raves from Hollywood groups including MPAA and SAG-AFTRA. The MPAA was less kind to Espinel the next month when she teamed with tech companies to promote voluntary best practices to reduce the flow of ad dollars to sites that traffic in pirated content. Dodd called that initiative “an incremental step forward that addresses only a narrow subset of the problem” and places “disproportionate amount of the burden on rights holders”. Espinel stepped down the following month and the post has been vacant ever since.Also today, Obama nominated former FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski to the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board. He chaired the commission from June 2009 to March 2013.For all of Deadline’s headlines, follow us @Deadline on Twitterhttp://deadline.com/2014/08/president-obama-nominates-piracy-czar-danny-marti-826438/",Private

"The Daily TIP: TODAY'S DATE Trouble viewing this email? Click here for the web version of the Daily TIP. October 20, 2014 Uproar after NYT reports Obama administration to circumvent Congress on potentially weakened Iran deal Gazan Hamas leader's daughter hospitalized in Israel The State Department scrambled on Sunday to respond to a weekend New York Times scoop revealing that the Obama administration intends to bypass Congress in reducing sanctions on Iran - the Times' exact language was that ""President Obama will do everything in his power to avoid letting Congress vote on"" an agreement with the Islamic republic - as both lawmakers expressed opposition and journalists pressed for clarification. The Times had quoted a senior official declaring that the White House ""wouldn’t seek congressional legislation in any comprehensive agreement for years,"" and gestured toward what is expected to be widespread opposition on the Hill to being frozen out. Bipartisan majorities of lawmakers have demanded that Congress be given the ability to help shape an acceptable agreement, and most analysts had long assumed that the administration would need to seek legislation rolling back previously passed financial restrictions on Tehran. The National Iranian American Council (NIAC) - a group that has been accused by members of Congress of peddling ""propaganda put out by the Iranian regime"" - had explicitly called on the White House to work with Congress in unwinding sanctions, prompting Congressional Quarterly (CQ) to identify the lobby's stance as a rare point of convergence between opposite sides of the Iran debate. Subsequent months had seen a steady erosion in the West's negotiating posture toward Iran, as American diplomats reportedly caved on Iranian red lines involving uranium enrichment, plutonium production, and ballistic missile development. The Obama administration is now thought to have among other things given up on the long-standing demand - codified in half a dozen United Nations Security Council resolutions - that Iran dismantle centrifuges used for uranium enrichment. Bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate months ago identified the condition as a prerequisite to any acceptable deal with Iran, and lawmakers have started reacting to Monday's Times story by vowing to fight ""unilateral action"" on sanctions by the White House. The administration for its part is suggesting that Congress will certainly have a role to play in reducing sanctions, but White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Shultz told reporters at a gaggle today that he couldn't describe that role because ""it's way too early to speculate on which sanctions will require legislative versus executive action to suspend or lift."" The point was echoed by State Department Deputy Spokeswoman Marie Harf, who told reporters that it was ""too early"" to identify which sanctions the administration would seek to lift in the near-term. Journalists pointed out that in fact the sides have drafted precisely worded documents lining up specific Iranian concessions with specific financial relief, and that in any case a senior State Department spokesperson told reporters last week that negotiators ""have isolated"" the precise sanctions in play. Associated Press (AP) journalist Bradley Klapper later took to Twitter to highlight that juxtaposition. Meanwhile the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog (IAEA) announced that Iran was continuing to deny the agency access to areas where the international community suspects military-related atomic work - including work related to the creation of nuclear warheads - has been conducted. Reuters described comments made Monday by IAEA chief Yukiya Amano as indicating that ""little headway [had been made] in an inquiry into suspected bomb research,"" and the Associated Press assessed that Amano's comments were aimed at ""sounding a note of caution about Iran's claims that it is not interested in nuclear arms."" Harf described the IAEA chief's concerns as ""nothing new."" Gazan Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh recently turned to an Israeli hospital again for help, this time for emergency medical treatment for one of his 13 children. Hebrew media reports say Haniyeh’s daughter was hospitalized for about a week at the Tel Aviv Soraski Medical Center earlier this month. Haniyeh’s mother-in-law sought medical treatment in Israel earlier this year and his granddaughter was cared for in an Israeli hospital last year. According to a Haaretz report, the Tel Aviv Soraski Medical Center (also known as Ichilov Hospital) confirmed that Haniyeh’s daughter was one of the more than a thousand patients from the Gaza Strip and Palestinian Authority who are treated at the hospital on an annual basis. Hospital officials did not publicize what treatment Haniyeh’s daughter received. (via Israel21c) Click here to unsubscribe",Private

This is where the following two groups can make a difference. I hope you will support them.Â Senior Votes Count!:Â They show up in the ""on"" years and the ""off"" years. But they often donâ€™t show up at the polls as well informed as they should be. And way too often they vote against their own self-interest, in favor of candidates who threaten cherished senior programs like Medicare and Social Security! Seniors are statistically the most reliable segment of the population to turn out in every election cycle. So moving the needle just a few points in the direction of candidates who will fight to protect and preserve the benefits seniors have earned throughout their working lifetimes can easily be the deciding factor in any close race. That's why a new Political Action Committee calledÂ SENIOR VOTES COUNT!Â Think of the organization as an ""Emily's List"" for seniors!Â The principals of this new, one-of-a-kind organization include veterans of hundreds of campaigns, some with ""celebrity"" clout, and experts with vast experience on issues that impact seniors. My friend Jon Bauman â€œThe Bowzer from Sha Na Naâ€ is one of the founders. They can make the difference in the kind of Congress and state governments we have moving forward. For the 2014 election cycle, your contribution will be used first and foremost to send this expert principal staff directly into key U.S. House, Senate and Gubernatorial races where they have endorsed candidates. Remember, seniors will show up at the polls, so they need to know which candidate is working in their best interests! Senior votes will count in 2014! So please support SENIOR VOTES COUNT!Â Contribute now to help fund Senior Votes! groundbreaking work around the country!Â VoteRiders:Â Voter ID is the civil rights struggle of our time. Millions of Americans â€“ from veterans to the elderly to young adults to women - are losing their right to vote because of voter ID laws.Â Knowing that millions of potential voters may be disenfranchised by the increasing number of stringent voter ID laws, my friend Kathleen Unger decided to take action by creatingÂ VoteRiders.Â VoteRiders is a non-partisan, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization whose mission is to ensure that all citizens are able to exercise their right to vote. Through resources and media exposure, VoteRiders supports on-the-ground organizations that assist citizens to secure their voter ID and inspires local volunteers and communities to sustain such programs and galvanize others to emulate these efforts.Â VoteRiders is the only organization whose sole mission is to protect the right to vote by helping voters meet the requirements of their state's voter ID law. Your tax-deductible contribution will enable VoteRiders to build a nationwide Voter ID Network of organizations and individuals who support our efforts so citizens can vote.Â Here are some examples of how your donation can be used:Â $25:Â Â Â Â Â Â Copy of a birth certificate$125:Â Â Â Â Copy of a birth certificate for five voters$500:Â Â Â Â Document fees for one Voter ID Clinic$2,000:Â Partner Organization costs for one Voter ID Clinic$5,000:Â Communications including media exposure for voter ID outreach in one stateÂ VoteRiders is already on the ground in key states and needs your help to ensure anyone who wants to vote can vote.Â And 100% of your contribution is tax deductible!!Â Click here to contribute to VoteRiders.Â Â Finally, there are some amazing progressives that are running office and I strongly encourage you to support. I have met each one of them and recommend them without hesitation.Â Governor Dan Malloy:Â Dan Malloy is running for his second term as Governor of Connecticut.Â Click here to read more about Dan.Â Under Dan Malloyâ€™s progressive leadership, Connecticut became the first state in the nation to pass a minimum wage increase to $10.10 an hour and to pass legislation guaranteeing paid sick leave to workers. Dan Malloy passed historic gun safety legislation, bipartisan education reform and a first of its kind comprehensive energy strategy. Crime is at one of the lowest points in decades, and Connecticutâ€™s health care exchange more than doubled its enrollment goals for signing up residents for quality, affordable health care. We simply cannot let the NRA defeat Dan!Â Click here to donate to Danâ€™s campaign.Â Alison Lundergan Grimes: Alison Lundergan Grimes is the Kentucky Secretary of State and is running for US Senate against Mitch McConnell, the chief DC obstructionist.Â Click here to read more about Alison.Â Alison is in a dead heat and has an excellent opportunity to win this race, which has become the most expensive in history of Senatorial campaigns.Â Click here to donate to Alisonâ€™s campaign.Â Michelle Nunn:Â Michelle Nunn is running for US Senate in Georgia.

"Boehner (Obama Lawsuit) Hours ago, Republicans held a hearing to launch their biggest attack yet against President Obama -- they are suing the President.

"Who will help President Obama on climate change? These two senators have been crucial leaders in the fight to stop climate change. Chuck Schumer Amy, Contribute to Al Franken and Mark Udall today. In his annual State of the Union address this week, President Obama said something aimed directly at the tea party climate deniers who have their head in the sand: ""The shift to a cleaner energy economy won't happen overnight, and it will require tough choices along the way. But the debate is settled. Climate change is a fact."" -Barack Obama, January 28, 2014 While climate change is a fact, unfortunately so is Republican resistance to the president's agenda. That's why we can't let Republicans undo our Senate majority -- and it's why we especially need to help Democrats who are fighting for President Obama's climate agenda. Senator Al Franken of Minnesota and Senator Mark Udall of Colorado have worked tirelessly to find smart energy solutions that will help reduce our carbon pollution and use energy more efficiently -- all while promoting job creation. We need to make sure they win reelection. But both have drawn extreme and competitive challengers this year. Contribute $5 to help Al Franken and Mark Udall beat their extreme challengers and win reelection this year. Considering the obstruction we've faced from Republicans, we've actually been able to do a lot. As the president said on Tuesday, ""Over the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on earth."" We need to do more -- much more -- but that is great progress. And we didn't get that far because of Republican obstruction. We've made progress because of leaders like Al and Mark, who are working tirelessly to improve our climate policies. Keep climate policy leaders like Al Franken and Mark Udall in the Senate. Contribute $5 today. Both Al Franken and Mark Udall have also been important progressive allies on other issues, too. Al has been one of our leading progressive senators ever since he was elected. He's co-sponsored bills to extend unemployment insurance, limit student loan interest rates, end workplace discrimination, improve health care for veterans and more -- and that's just in the last few months! Mark has been a key leader on legislation like the Violence Against Women Act and ending Don't Ask Don't Tell, so our men and women can serve regardless of their sexual orientation. Most importantly, while Republicans are stymieing high-profile environmental legislation, he's working on the type of project that's helped reduce our carbon pollution so much -- like a national energy standard and energy efficiency in schools. Al Franken and Mark Udall are both in tough races, and we can't afford to lose either one. Contribute $5 to help their reelection campaigns today. Like President Obama said, ""When our children’s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I",Private

I can’t imagine they need this much info, but I fear them not being aware of something big/significant.

"FW: Briefing for roundtable discussion with President Obama and the audiovisual sector FYI From: Weaver, Keith Sent: Saturday, November 23, 2013 12:01 PM To: Mulvihill, Christina Cc: Seligman, Nicole Subject: Briefing for roundtable discussion with President Obama and the audiovisual sector Hi Christina, Per our previous communications, attached please find the briefing document for Tuesday’s roundtable discussion with President Obama and the audiovisual sector. As you will note from our prior communications (including with our colleagues in Tokyo), there are few things to keep in mind with respect to this meeting: - Limited information has been provided – We know that the President wants to speak about the contributions of the audiovisual sector to the U.S. economy, DreamWorks Animation is the host/venue, there is a private roundtable discussion for roughly 45 minutes (attendees listed in the briefing), we understand the format of the meeting will include introductory photos and remarks by the President, remarks by Jeffrey Katzenberg, remarks by Chris Dodd, and the roundtable will be followed by a public address about the economic relevance from U.S. perspective. - The roundtable is unlikely a forum for detailed substantive discussion – Given the number of participants, the time allotted, and the individual photo meet/greet component, it’s unlikely going to get into more than a very high-level discussion. The briefing here covers an array of issues from the U.S. audiovisual sector perspective, but it is not exhaustive. Because of this, I’ve invited my colleagues to augment my briefing with any additional details or nuances they deem necessary and appropriate in a separate side briefing to Hirai-san (of course, you are welcome to do the same). As with any Presidential visit, there is typically a protest of some sort. From an overall awareness, security, and PR standpoint, I will keep you and other key people apprised of this – we are unlikely to have a clear read on this until Monday at soonest. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions. Have a great weekend! Best, KW Attachments: Background Briefing - President OBAMA @ DWA 11.26.13.pdf (179447 Bytes)",Private
"Alert - President Obama Signs Executive Order Targeting Persons Threatening Peace, Sovereignty, and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine; European Union Sanctions Former Ukrainian Leaders Gibson Dunn Alert gd_banner Home · Practices · Lawyers · Diversity · Pro Bono · Firm News · Publications _____ President Obama Signs Executive Order Targeting Persons Threatening Peace, Sovereignty, and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine; European Union Sanctions Former Ukrainian Leaders _____ March 10, 2014 To Our Clients and Friends: In response to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, on March 6, 2014, President Obama signed an Executive Order ""Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Ukraine"" (""Ukraine E.O."" or ""E.O."").[1] The text of the E.O. is available here. The Ukraine E.O. targets persons who undermine democratic processes and institutions in Ukraine and who threaten the country's peace, security, stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. President Obama signed the Ukraine E.O. in response to the recent political upheaval in Ukraine, including Russia's movement of troops into the Crimea, a peninsula off southeastern Ukraine with a large ethnically Russian population. While the Ukraine E.O. provides the Secretary of the Treasury with the authority to block the property of individuals who have violated the provisions of the E.O.,[2] no individuals have yet been determined to have committed such violations. Depending on how the political crisis in Ukraine unfolds, it is likely that the Secretary of the Treasury will make such determinations in the coming days. Companies should pay close attention to any announcements by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC"") at the U.S. Department of the Treasury related to the Ukraine E.O. to monitor for new designations. Once an entity or person is designated, it will immediately be unlawful for any U.S person or company to do business with the designated party, and any property in which the designated party has an interest must be blocked. In addition, on March 5, 2014, the European Union imposed restrictive measures on 18 former senior Ukrainian officials, including former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, identified for being responsible for the misappropriation of Ukrainian state funds.[3] The Council of the European Union's Decision provides the authority to freeze funds and economic resources belonging to, owned, held, or controlled by persons having been identified for the misappropriation of Ukrainian state funds or human rights abuses in the Ukraine.[4] In addition, the United Kingdom issued sanctions consistent with European Union regulation 208/2014. The U.K. financial sanctions froze the assets of Viktor Yanukovych and others, including members of his family, certain members of his government, and associates. The notice is available here. Key Provisions of the Executive Order The Ukraine E.O. broadly targets individuals who undermine both the democratic institutions and the peace and stability of Ukraine. Notably, the E.O. provides the Secretary of the Treasury with the authority to penalize both Ukrainian and Russian persons. First, the E.O. blocks all property and interests in property in the United States of any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to be responsible for, or complicit in, a number of different activities.[5] These activities include actions that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Ukraine, that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine, or that misappropriate Ukrainian state assets or those of a significant entity in Ukraine.[6] Second, the E.O. also blocks the property of those persons determined to have asserted governmental authority over any part or region of Ukraine without the authorization of the Government of Ukraine, or those persons determined to be a leader of an entity that has, or whose members have, engaged in any of the activities threatening the democratic processes or peace and stability of Ukraine.[7] Third, the E.O. blocks the property of those persons determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, any of the activities threatening the democratic processes or peace and stability of Ukraine.[8] It also blocks the property of persons determined to be owned or controlled by any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the E.O.[9] Fourth, the E.O. suspends entry into the United States of persons determined to have engaged in the activities described above.[10] Though no specific list of the individuals and entities targeted by the E.O. has yet been released, a senior administration official has indicated that these sanctions initially will be limited to a small number of people.[11] Recommendations The Ukraine E.O. and the European Union's restrictive measures are the first steps the United States and the European Union have taken to bring economic pressure to bear in helping resolve the political crisis in Ukraine. Whether the crisis deepens or relaxes will likely determine if the United States and the European Union take additional steps to penalize former Ukrainian leaders and Russian officials. Looking ahead, companies should also be aware of at least three potential developments. First, Russia has indicated it may penalize U.S. businesses following the imposition of U.S. sanctions. Companies should therefore pay close attention to any such Russian actions to ensure that they are not targeted. Second, if the United States sanctions Russian officials, such action may significantly increase the likelihood that Russia will target U.S. businesses. Third, the United States may impose additional penalties on Ukrainian and Russian persons, and companies should closely monitor any additional Executive Orders, legislation, or regulations that target such persons. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher attorneys stand ready to assist our clients and friends with any issues they may face related to these developments. _____ http://pgdc/publications/Pages/Forms/EditForm.aspx?ID=2509&Source=http%3A%2F%2Fpgdc%2Fpublications%2FPages%2FForms%2FRecentPublications%2Easpx#_ftnref1 [1] Exec.

"Hedge Funds' Secret Weapon Is Ex-Obama Aide Austan Goolsbee: CNBC Great article (below) on the 32 Advisors Economic Advisory practice, led by Austan Goolsbee, as we celebrate our one year anniversary. Robert Wolf CEO 32 Advisors, LLC 590 Madison Avenue 34th Floor New York, NY 10022 212-607-2452 (office) 203-550-8685 (cell) rwolf@32advisors.com Twitter: @robertwolf32 www.32advisors.com Hedge funds and other Wall Street firms have used an unlikely counselor for the past year: a former top economist for President Barack Obama. Through a contract with New York City-based consultancy 32 Advisors, Austan Goolsbee has held conference calls most Fridays since February 2013 with employees of large hedge fund firms Fortress Investment Group, York Capital Management, Perella Weinberg Partners, SkyBridge Capital and others. Those firms and others paying to be on the call get to hear from Goolsbeee on the most important economic and policy issues of the day, such as Federal Reserve moves, the U.S. housing market, bitcoin, high-frequency trading, Chinese growth and the debt ceiling. Goolsbee does not give trade ideas for the hedge funds, but rather they get his big-picture perspective on issues more indirectly related to their investments. https://gallery.mailchimp.com/a2e28e2696898a6cb03d99d33/images/Snip20140406_9.png Senior leaders of the firms, including York founder James Dinan, Perella Weinberg partner and portfolio manager Dan Arbess, and SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci are often on the line, asking questions and listening to Goolsbee's analysis over the 45- to 90-minute weekly sessions. The calls are limited to 18 participants and include major industrial companies, banks and private equity firms. Arbess called Goolsbee ""a brilliant and flexible-minded economist"" who helps him understand the intersection of government policy and investing in part because of his ""strong informal ties"" with the Obama administration. ""Maintaining a regular dialogue with Austan helps us better understand the administration's economic policies, and economic policy decisions debated in other parts of the government, and maybe even exchange views in a helpful way in the other direction, too,"" Arbess said. Another fan is Scaramucci. ""He has the ability to apply his practical knowledge of the world and his insider understanding of the personalities that are driving key policy,"" Scaramucci said. ""The world has changed (as) governments have taken a more integrated role in the global economy. Austan's advice and guidance have been priceless."" Scaramucci—a member of Mitt Romney's president campaign finance committee—spoke of Goolsbee's ""thoughtful"" counsel on subjects like China, Europe, housing and the debt ceiling debates. York's Dinan declined to comment. A spokesman for Fortress did not respond to a request for comment. Goolsbee, now a professor of economics at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business, was chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers from 2010 to 2011 and chief economist and staff director for the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board from 2009 to 2011. Robert Wolf, 32 Advisors founder, was also a member, along with former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, General Electric's Jeffrey Immelt and others. Goolsbee met Wolf—one of Obama's most important financial industry supporters as chairman and CEO of UBS Americas—when Goolsbee was an economic adviser during Obama's first campaign for the White House. He has strong ties to politics and policy. In an interview, Goolsbee said he was ""longtime friends"" with Fed Chair Janet Yellen and knows her predecessor Ben Bernanke ""very well."" He also travels frequently, meeting foreign officials and economists along the way. Goolsbee is clear that he's not providing the hedge fund clients with any inside or early information. Goolsbee notes his training on the rules of theSTOCK Act—a new law to curtail the use of political information in investing—and focus on macroeconomic issues vs. specific legislative developments. ""We're not even close to the line to that sort of thing,"" he said. Goolsbee credits Wolf with getting him involved. ""He said, 'Look, you know a lot about economics, the Fed, the international economy, how policy is made and affects things. On Wall Street and at big industrial companies and investors and a bunch of people, there's a lot of demand for that,'"" Goolsbee said of Wolf's pitch. ""The intersection of policy, the U.S. and world economy and what's happening in Washington—there's never been a time when that nexus has been more influential on the private sector, on markets and on how companies behave."" Former senior government economists and officials consulting for Wall Street is nothing new. Firms similar to 32 Advisors include The Lindsey Group, led by former President George W. Bush's economic advisor Larry Lindsey, and Macroeconomic Advisors, co-founded by former Fed governor Larry Meyer. Larry Summers, who also served as an advisor for Obama, also worked for hedge fund firm D.E.Shaw and Citigroup while out of the government. https://gallery.mailchimp.com/a2e28e2696898a6cb03d99d33/images/Snip20140406_4.png Wolf is happy to have Goolsbee on his team, even if it's part time.

"Re: Briefing for roundtable discussion with President Obama and the audiovisual sector Thanks On Nov 23, 2013, at 12:01 PM, ""Weaver, Keith"" <Keith_Weaver@spe.sony.com> wrote: FYI From: Weaver, Keith Sent: Saturday, November 23, 2013 12:01 PM To: Mulvihill, Christina Cc: Seligman, Nicole Subject: Briefing for roundtable discussion with President Obama and the audiovisual sector Hi Christina, Per our previous communications, attached please find the briefing document for Tuesday’s roundtable discussion with President Obama and the audiovisual sector. As you will note from our prior communications (including with our colleagues in Tokyo), there are few things to keep in mind with respect to this meeting: - Limited information has been provided – We know that the President wants to speak about the contributions of the audiovisual sector to the U.S. economy, DreamWorks Animation is the host/venue, there is a private roundtable discussion for roughly 45 minutes (attendees listed in the briefing), we understand the format of the meeting will include introductory photos and remarks by the President, remarks by Jeffrey Katzenberg, remarks by Chris Dodd, and the roundtable will be followed by a public address about the economic relevance from U.S. perspective. - The roundtable is unlikely a forum for detailed substantive discussion – Given the number of participants, the time allotted, and the individual photo meet/greet component, it’s unlikely going to get into more than a very high-level discussion. The briefing here covers an array of issues from the U.S. audiovisual sector perspective, but it is not exhaustive. Because of this, I’ve invited my colleagues to augment my briefing with any additional details or nuances they deem necessary and appropriate in a separate side briefing to Hirai-san (of course, you are welcome to do the same). As with any Presidential visit, there is typically a protest of some sort. From an overall awareness, security, and PR standpoint, I will keep you and other key people apprised of this – we are unlikely to have a clear read on this until Monday at soonest. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions. Have a great weekend! Best, KW <Background Briefing - President OBAMA @ DWA 11.26.13.pdf>",Private

In response to these events, the Obama Administration issued new sanctions targeting individuals and entities in the Russian Federation, including any Russian Federation officials. This step marks the most comprehensive sanctions the U.S. has imposed on Russia since the Cold War and carries the potential to change dramatically the tone of US-Russian relations. While the sanctions may have more symbolic value than immediate practical impact on the targeted individuals, the Russian response could be dramatic, and the unfolding events underscore the need for U.S. persons doing business in Russia and Ukraine to review their relationships and develop exit strategies and other risk mitigation measures.

"Tech Trends TECH TRENDS - Week of November 10 via TechCrunch: How YouTube Music Key Will Redefine What We Consider ‘Music’ ""YouTube finally unveiled its subscription music service this week, and in some ways it’s very much like existing streaming music services, especially since it comes bundled with Google Play Music All Access. But YouTube Music Key also very much not like other streaming music services, because of the ways in which music is (or rather isn’t) defined on YouTube. One of the first questions I had about Google Music Key was how the company would define what kind of content from YouTube gets included: Would a home-shot cover of a Black Keys song with 253 views be as ad-free as the official music video for the original? Or was this a private club, designed for the traditionally defined music industry? Turns out, the nature of what Music Key encompasses is somewhat of a moving target, and the limited beta access that will initially gate entry to the service is in part due to that variability."" Read the full story over at TechCrunch, and another interesting take on Google Music Key from Mark Mulligan here. In Case You Missed It: Some of the most important music, media and tech stories from the past week, and some of the most interesting takes on them, just in case you missed them. OBAMA ANNOUNCES SUPPORT FOR NET NEUTRALITY Good news this week in the fight for net neutrality – on Monday President Obama publicly announced his support for a free and open Internet. The POTUS released a highly publicized video and letter announcement on the matter, in which he declares that the Internet should be reclassified as a utility, which no cable company or access provider should be able to put limits on. Read Obama’s full letter and watch the video supporting net neutrality here. HASBRO IN TALKS TO BUY DREAMWORKS ANIMATION? It was widely reported this week that toymaker Hasbro is in talks to acquire DreamWorks Animation. If it happens, it would give Hasbro an extremely valuable new outlet for its products, which include popular toys like Transformers and Fluttershy. According to the NY Times, DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg is asking for payment as a mixture of cash and shares (priced at $30 each, much higher than the current share value of $22.37), and he would stay with the company after the acquisition. Get all the details on the potential Hasbro/DreamWorks deal here. MOBILE GAMING BUSINESS BOOMING A new report on mobile gaming this week revealed that the industry is set to bring in over $4.6 billion in revenue this year (in North America alone). Part of this is likely due to the fact that the mobile gaming industry’s audience has been noticeably broadening to include younger and younger users. The current average age of a mobile gamer is 27.7 years old, which is significantly lower than it was just a year ago at 35.7 years old. Other possible factors in the revenue boost include advances in social features and brand extensions. Read the full report on the state of mobile gaming here.

"Spain: Update - State Council - Rajoy/Obama - Legal Offer Portal - GFK (EBW13028) (Re-sent due to server error – apologies to those who might have already received this) FOR YOUR INFORMATION Following up on our Spain Working Group call early last week and as promised, please find attached additional information related to the favourable opinion that the State Council has recently issued, along with some follow-up material from the Dodd/Rajoy meeting, for your records. Also attached is relevant material from separate follow-up with Secretary of State for Telcos and Info. Society Victor Calvo-Sotelo. You will find additional update points below: State Council Opinion: As commented on the call, the State Council, the highest advisory authority consulted on the IP Draft Law before its ultimate passage through Government (before it moves to Parliament), has issued an outstanding opinion on the draft legislation, very much in line with the amendment proposals that the Coalición has been pushing relentlessly for almost a year. Main points: -The State Council states that the draft law as it stands does not seem to be the instrument that will guarantee the appropriate level of protection of IP rights, or that will guarantee an agile and effective administrative procedure to protect those right; -It criticizes across the board all the texts in preparation for containing an excessive amount of vague and imprecise terms. -It states that site-blocking should be considered a priority as the “most effective measure to remedy the violation of IP rights”. -It recommends changes in the nature and composition of the IP Commission, and goes on to state that the “current regime of sanctions is dysfunctional, defect and lack coherence”. -It recommends to include search engines in the scope of the draft (previously evacuated through language in the recitals). This is a major achievement that we owe not only to the Coalición and its members, but also to Santiago Muñoz Machado, the lawyer whom we hired last April to give precisely that sort of extra push beyond the Coalition’s perimeter of action. Machado was instrumental in obtaining that unanimous decision among the Council members. This is obviously a major thorn in the side of the Minister of Culture Ignacio Wert who was hoping for a prompt approval of the text by the Government. It seems that the draft IP Law will now be presented to the Government around mid-January (as opposed to today, 20 Dec., the expected date before the State Council opinion came out). The text has not resurfaced but we hear that subsidiarity may have been deleted at last (fingers crossed!) The Coalición seized this opportunity to echo the State Council opinion in the press (with a few days delay, so that it would be distinct from the buzz of collecting societies rejoicing, too, after sections of the draft most relevant to them were struck by the State Council). Various op-eds have been prepared by individual Coalicion members and should be published soon. The Coalición is also drafting amendment proposals to the Organic law amending the Penal Code (already in Parliament, as you know) which reflect points contained in the State Council opinion. Parliamentary questions have also been prepared and issued (e.g. on the degree of cooperation [or lack thereof] between SETSI (Telco ministry) and the IP Commission. Rajoy to meet Obama President Rajoy will be meeting with President Obama on 13 January in Washington, DC. We are working on very high level talking points that Senator Dodd will carry to the White House in preparation for the meeting.

Now it's your turn to join us. There is no one to whom you or I owe a greater debt of service than to our veterans. Yet, across the country, veterans find themselves with few opportunities and little chance to get ahead when they return home. The heartbreaking reality is that nearly 60,000 veterans will be sleeping on the streets tonight. The President, the First Lady, and I are determined to bring that number down to zero. Unfortunately, Los Angeles has more homeless former service members than any other American city. Winning here means we can win everywhere.",Private

Right now, John Boehner and his Republican attack dogs are trying to bring down the law by searching for a handful of anti-Obamacare stories to screech about. We know for every one of their stories, there are a hundred stories about how repealing reform would hurt Americans who are counting on the Affordable Care Act. You might even have your own. Maybe you have a child with a preexisting condition who can finally get affordable coverage, or maybe you received a health care rebate.

"Draft Briefing for Kaz, ML, and AP for meeting with other execs and President Obama Hi LW, For your review…. Attached is a draft briefing for Kaz, Michael, and Amy… I’ve just learned that they all (including Amy) are attending the roundtable discussion with the President at DreamWorks Animation a week from today. While I managed to get the attendees and understand the topic is fairly broad (helping Hollywood from a USG standpoint), it’s unlikely I will get more specific info. I understand from the government affairs people in Tokyo that Kaz doesn’t have a particular briefing style/preference. I’ve drafted the briefing in a manner that presumes varied levels of understanding – the good news is I think any reader would understand the issues, but the trade-off is I explained a bit more and this made the briefing a bit longer (and I didn’t want our folks to feel insufficiently prepared). I can’t imagine they need this much info, but I fear them not being aware of something big/significant. Let me know what you think… Once you bless/tweak, I will –with ML’s blessing- circulate to the Tokyo people for feedback concurrent with giving it to him/Amy (but before giving to Kaz). Does that seem like the best approach to you? KW Attachments: KH.ML.AP - Brief for Obama - 11.26.13 DRAFT.docx (32157 Bytes)",Private

"President Obama Imposes Broad Sanctions Framework in Response to Ukraine Crisis – Prepare for an Uncertain Future Paul Hastings Stay Current President Obama Imposes Broad Sanctions Framework in Response to Ukraine Crisis – Prepare for an Uncertain Future Read the full alert Read other recent alerts BY SCOTT M. FLICKER, CHARLES A. PATRIZIA, HAMILTON LOEB & DEVON E. WINKLES As part of its response to the unfolding events in Ukraine, on March 6 the White House issued a broad Executive Order authorizing the Treasury Department to impose sanctions on persons or entities found to have ties to the former regime of Viktor Yanukovych, to have participated in efforts to suppress the Kiev uprising, or to be involved in the occupation of Crimea by forces linked to the Russian military. The EU has imposed a freeze on the assets of Yanukovych, certain immediate family members, and officials in this government. The situation in Crimea remains extremely fluid, and the prospect exists for broader sanctions, even against Russian funds, companies, and officials. U.S. and European companies involved in a current or planned investment in Ukraine or Russia, or a transaction with counterparties tied to activities falling within the broader outlines of the U.S. and EU sanctions programs, should engage in an immediate and sober assessment of the risks inherent in continuing the activity.

We're now just four days out -- and the President wanted you to get the first preview of what this speech is all about. As always, he'll be working on it right up until game time, but three words sum up the President's message on Tuesday night: opportunity, action, and optimism. The core idea is as American as they come: If you work hard and play by the rules, you should have the opportunity to succeed. Your ability to get ahead should be based on your hard work and ambition and who you want to be, not just the raw circumstance of who you are when you're born. On Tuesday night, the President will lay out a set of real, concrete, practical proposals to grow the economy, strengthen the middle class, and empower all who hope to join it. RSVP now and watch the enhanced State of the Union on WhiteHouse.gov this Tuesday night: RSVP In this year of action, the President will seek out as many opportunities as possible to work with Congress in a bipartisan way. But when American jobs and livelihoods depend on getting something done, he will not wait for Congress.

"Thank you! Dear NFC, For all those who could join us last week for our 2014 Winter NFC Meeting and Reception with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, we were so glad you could make it. I hope you were able to walk away, having both enjoyed yourself and gaining a greater understanding of what we are working to accomplish at the DNC. For those who couldn’t join us, we hope to see you next time! Below you will find a list of upcoming events, a link to President Obama’s speech to the DNC, recent articles and messages regarding the DNC’s new Project Ivy and Voter Expansion Project, and attached are an outline version of the Four Pillars and a Project Ivy Fact Sheet. Thank you again for all that you do. Sincerely, Henry R. Muñoz III National Finance Chair Democratic National Committee Upcoming DNC Finance Events 3/5/2014 Discussion with President Obama When: Wednesday, March 5th Where: Boston, MA Link: https://my.democrats.org/MADiscussionMarch5 Staff Contact: Rachel Rauscher at rauscherr@dnc.org Dinner with President Obama When: Wednesday, March 5th Where: Boston, MA Link: https://my.democrats.org/MADinnerMarch5 Staff Contact: Rachel Rauscher at rauscherr@dnc.org President Obama’s Address to the DNC Winter Meeting http://youtu.be/UM_2M5nUrY4 Project Ivy What’s Really Happening With the Technology and Data That Helped President Obama Win by Matt Compton and Andrew Brown On Election Night in 2013, long after we knew who’d be the next mayor of New York and governor of Virginia, news outlets reported the race for attorney general in Virginia was too close to call—and Mark Obenshain, the Republican candidate, was in the lead. But at the Democratic National Committee, we were pretty sure that things would swing our way. Here’s why: Hours earlier, our data analysts had recalibrated their model based on voter turnout, and their projection left us confident not only that there would be a recount—but that Mark Herring, the Democrat, would win. As a result, our voter expansion team began preparations that night, and we had a jump start on mobilizing volunteers who would chase provisional ballots over the next few days. The model was right. Herring is now the attorney general for the Commonwealth of Virginia. The technology and learning that helped Democrats win in Virginia last November wasn’t created overnight, and it wasn’t created from scratch in 2013. It was the result of a decade-long investment by the Democratic Party. And the resulting innovations reflect our core Democratic values — that we are better with more inclusion, more participation, and when more voices get heard. That’s what both Obama campaigns did, and now Democratic races of all sizes will have access to the same technology. In 2013, the DNC worked to make the Obama campaign’s cutting-edge tools and technology scalable to races of all sizes. Because of our investment, more than 250 days before the 2014 Election Day, Democrats up and down the ballot are writing campaign plans and calculating budget numbers, confident that they’ll be able to draw upon the same data resources and technological tools that helped President Obama to win reelection—just like Mark Herring did. And he wasn’t the only one. Terry McAuliffe’s campaign built and utilized a polling place locator tool in partnership with the DNC. The tool is streamlined and user-friendly, but the technology that powers it took years to develop, test, and refine. Over the course of the election, approximately the same number of people used the tool to find their polling place as the number of voters who ended up being Governor McAuliffe’s margin of victory. In 2014, Democrats across the country will be able to to use a white-label version of the same tool to help direct voters to the polls on Election Day. And that’s just one piece of technology the Obama campaign used to great effect that we’re making widely available this year. In 2012, when you signed up for information at BarackObama.com, a piece of technology code named Airwolf compared your voter profile against a data model to determine your support score, and then automatically delivered a message from a local campaign organizer reminding you to cast a ballot, sign up to make calls, or volunteer to canvass your neighborhood. It made the connection between the online and offline worlds of the campaign nearly seamless and helped to make the best field program in the history of American politics a little bit more efficient, a little bit better. Just like the polling place look up tool, Airwolf didn’t go away when President Obama won reelection. The underlying codebase, along with the voter data and supporter models that powered the technology, are in the hands of the DNC because in 2013, the Obama campaign made a strategic decision to house all of their data and technology assets with the party. And today, engineers and analysts are working to make them available to state parties and targeted races all across the country. All of this work is part of Project Ivy at the DNC. We’re building on a foundation of experimentation, analysis, and thought leadership that stretches back a decade to develop tools and technology to empower state parties, campaigns, organizers, and voters. We’re calling ourselves Project Ivy because it’s where we’re located — on Ivy Street in Washington, D.C. — but the name is also a direct call back to our past. Through the course of four different iterations of investment in digital and technology, this team has helped to break through barriers and elect Democrats up and down the ballot. Plus, ivy is resilient, gets stronger year after year, and is tough enough to tear down walls—just like our program. We believe that Project Ivy is going to help Democrats win elections at all levels and move our country forward. And we want you to be part of it. Matt Compton is the Digital Director at the Democratic National Committee, and Andrew Brown is the Technology Director at the Democratic National Committee. Democrats Try to Build on Technology Lead Wall Street Journal/ Patrick O’Connor President Barack Obama‘s re-election effort revolutionized how campaigns locate and persuade likely supporters. The Democratic National Committee now wants to offer those tools to candidates much lower down the ballot. The DNC launched the latest iteration of its data and technology arm this week ahead of the committee’s winter meeting. The goal is to build off of breakthroughs the party made in each of the past two presidential elections by helping candidates at every level benefit from lessons learned during those earlier campaigns. DNC ups tech push ahead of midterms CNN/ Dana Davidsen The Democratic National Committee is working to leverage the voter data and election tools refined during Barack Obama's historically tech-savvy campaigns in upcoming elections. The DNC said it's making accessible to Democratic campaigns nationwide this year a voter file with constantly updated data from past elections in an effort to coordinate voter information as well as help those campaigns better strategize and manage volunteers. Project Ivy: Democrats Taking Obama Technology Down Ballot Time/ Zeke Miller Fifteen months after the 2012 presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee announced a new effort Monday to make the advanced data tools used by the Obama campaign available to Democratic candidates across the country. The initiative, nicknamed Project Ivy, will take many of the sophisticated data, analytics, and communications tools used by the Obama campaign out of storage, allowing them to be used by Democratic candidates from school board to Senate, party officials told reporters Monday afternoon, as Democrats look to maintain their technological advantage over better-funded Republicans. Democrats strive to stay ahead in tech race The Hill/ Alex Jaffe The Democratic National Committee is pledging to maintain its data and technological advantage over the GOP to meet its biggest challenge yet: the 2014 midterm elections. Staffers at the DNC are working to translate many of the unprecedented data tools that made President Obama’s reelection campaign the most technologically savvy in history to campaigns up and down the ballot this election year. NGP VAN touts DNC's 'Project Ivy' Campaigns and Election/ Sean Miller NGP VAN is bullish on the Democrats' ability to stay ahead in the tech race. The Democratic National Committee this week launched Project Ivy, a multi-million dollar effort to put tools like NGP VAN's Votebuilder into the hands of downballot candidates. Naturally, the firm was ""honored"" to expand its market reach. ""Not only do Democrats have the message and technology to run smart, data driven campaigns up and down the ballot – they have a culture that values and knows how to apply that technology”, Bryan Whitaker, COO of NGP VAN, said in a statement. “No one is resting on their laurels, and we’re all-in to help build on our technological competitive advantage over Republicans."" Campaign Trail: DNC Launches 'Project Ivy' Data Initiative for Democratic Campaigns In the Capital/ Ayobami Olugbemiga The Democratic National Committee announced Monday a new initiative to allow Democratic candidates across the country to access the data, analytics and communications tools used by the Obama campaign during the 2012 presidential election. The new effort, called Project Ivy, will take the technological tools that worked during the Obama campaign and scale them so they can be incorporated by every Democratic campaign in the 2014 midterms and beyond. “Project Ivy is the initiative at the heart of data and technology innovation for the Democratic Party,” reads theDNC fact sheet on the initiative. “Its mission is simple: to empower state parties, campaigns, organizers and voters to engage in elections at all levels by giving them access to the best tools from the 2012 Obama Campaign, while investing the tools of the future.” The Democratic Party Is Launching A Tech Startup Business Insider/ Hunter Walker This week, the Democratic National Committee is launching ""Project Ivy"" a program designed to bring to local races the tech tools that helped Barack Obama win the White House. As part of this multimillion dollar push, they're looking to hire a few good techies. A fact sheet distributed by the DNC Tuesday identified the ""four tools and strategies at the core of Project Ivy"" — a ""voter file and data warehouse,"" ""analytics infrastructure,"" ""field and marketing tools,"" and ""training and fostering a culture that cultivates further technological innovations."" The Voter Expansion Project From: Bill Clinton Subject: Launching today: the Voter Expansion Project Date: February 27, 2014 Friend -- There is no greater threat to the core values of our democracy than restrictions to the fundamental right to vote. As that threat grows, it's up to all of us to fight back. That's why I'm joining with the Democratic Party to launch our new Voter Expansion Project. I hope you'll watch the video I recorded, and then commit to join me: Here's what the Voter Expansion Project will do: We'll get more of our fellow citizens to vote -- not fewer. We'll work to make it easier to vote -- not harder. And we will make sure that once you cast your vote, it will count. There is nothing more fundamentally American than the notion that every citizen -- no matter who they are, where they come from, what they look like, or what their politics are -- ought to be able to make their voice heard. That's what I'm committed to doing, and I hope you'll join me: http://my.democrats.org/Voter-Expansion-Project Thanks, Bill Clinton Brazile: Why I am a Democrat and why your vote should count CNN//Donna Brazile, DNC Vice Chairwoman for Voter Registration and Participation In her 1976 keynote address to the Democratic National Committee, Texas Rep. Barbara Jordan said words I will never forget: ""We believe that the people are the source of all governmental power; that the authority of the people is to be extended, not restricted. This can be accomplished only by providing each citizen with every opportunity to participate in the management of the government. ""We believe that the government which represents the authority of all the people, not just one interest group, but all the people, has an obligation to actively seek to remove those obstacles which would block individual achievement -- obstacles emanating from race, sex, economic condition."" That explains why I am a Democrat. Beyond that, ensuring every American's right to vote and working to get out the vote -- every vote, regardless of party -- has been a lifelong goal, a personal quest. Today, unfortunately, the right to vote seems to have become a partisan issue. Democrats seek to guarantee and expand voting rights. Republicans try to undermine and suppress voting rights. It wasn't always this way. In 1965 when President Johnson realized that the previous year's Civil Rights Act was not enough, that the country needed a Voting Rights Act to protect the rights of citizens -- particularly blacks and minorities -- he called on the minority leader, Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen of Illinois, for help. Dirksen responded, and the bill passed. His words remain relevant: ""The right to vote is still an issue in this free country. There has to be a real remedy. This cannot go on forever, this denial of the right to vote by ruses and devices and tests and whatever the mind can contrive to either make it very difficult or to make it impossible to vote."" We agree. That is why I am proud to be launching the Democratic National Committee's new initiative -- the Voter Expansion Project -- where we are taking action to expand voting opportunities for all. We're moving beyond simply protecting the vote and becoming the leader in expanding the vote. The Voter Expansion Project's mission is clear: Ensure that every eligible citizen can register, every registered voter can vote, and every vote is accurately counted. Let me repeat that -- our mission is to ensure that every eligible citizen can register, every registered voter can vote, and every vote is accurately counted. I believe in the marketplace of ideas. I also believe that every citizen should have equal access -- through their voice and their vote. Today, too many Republicans are making it harder for working Americans, students, women, people of color and the elderly to participate in the process. In states like Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, Wisconsin and many others, we see Republican-controlled legislatures engaged in voter suppression efforts, such as curtailing early voting, requiring restrictive IDs, etc. That's not the American way. As Ronald Reagan said, ""For this nation to remain true to its principles, we cannot allow any American's vote to be denied, diluted or defiled. The right to vote is the crown jewel of American liberties, and we will not see its luster diminished."" So as an American, I invite Independents and, yes, Republicans to join us. In fact, I ask my Republican friends -- and adversaries -- to answer Dirksen's challenge -- ""How then shall there be government by the people if some of the people cannot speak?"" Answer it as he did -- by working for the people, by trusting the people -- all the people. But let me also be clear: As a Democrat and as an American, I don't believe we can wait. I am committed to the Voter Expansion Project because it will expand the vote by creating more access, engage more voters, protect the vote by breaking down barriers, demystify the process and make sure every vote is counted. More specifically, the Voter Expansion Project has four main goals: 1. Voter education -- train campaign staff, volunteers and voters about the rules and regulations in order to demystify the voting experience 2. Election administration -- work closely with electi Attachments: image001.png (46787 Bytes) image002.png (8887 Bytes) image003.png (210006 Bytes) image004.png (240820 Bytes) The DNC and the Four Pillars.pdf (245953 Bytes) DNC Project Ivy.pdf (1380128 Bytes)",Private

Its just that Romney was such an idiot, and still is, that we would be in worse shape if he became president. Not saying Obama has been doing a good job, but I have more confidence that he is surrounded by people with half a brain, as opposed to Romney’s people who had NO brains! 2016 is going to be interesting. There’s no one any one really wants on either side! From: Mosko, Steve Sent: Tuesday, October 07, 2014 3:19 PMTo: Kanner, FayanneSubject: Fwd: ???????? Still no answers... your guy!!. Who is this guy? did you ever question this yourself? amazing how the news media never cameup with anything, truly suspicious and questionable, don’t you think.? Doesn’t it seem strange that the one man to whom we entrust the most power and responsibility – is surrounded by more mystery than any of us? WHY???????? This came from a union guy in Chicago who didn't vote for Obama – a very interesting perspective that I never thought of in this light. It will be interesting to see what they put in his ""Presidential Library"" about his early years when he is out of office......... In a country where we take notice of many, many facets of our public figures' lives, doesn't it seem odd that there's so little we know about our current president, Barack Obama. For example, we know that Andrew Jackson's wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery, Abe Lincoln never went to school, Jack Kennedy wore a back brace and Harry Truman played the piano. As Americans, we enjoy knowing details about our newsmakers, but none of us know one single humanizing fact about the history of our own president. We are all aware of the lack of uncontestable birth records for Obama – that ‘document managing’ has been spectacularly successful. There are, however, several additional oddities in Obama's history that appear to be as well managed as the birthing issue. One other interesting thing... there are no birth certificates of his daughters that can be found. It's interesting that no one who ever dated him has shown up. The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his campaign certainly would, in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself. We all know about JFK's magnetism, that McCain was no monk and quite a few details about Palin's courtship and even her athletic prowess – and Joe Biden's aneurisms are no secret. Look at Cheney and Clinton – we all know about their heart problems. Certainly Wild Bill’s exploits before and during his White House years were well known. That's why it's so odd that not one lady has stepped up and said, ""He was soooo shy..."" or ""What a great dancer..."" It's virtually impossible to know anything about this fellow. Who was the best man at his wedding? Start there. Then check groomsmen. Then get the footage of the graduation ceremony. Has anyone talked to the professors? It is odd that no one is bragging that they knew him or taught him or lived with him. When did he meet Michele, and how? Are there photos there? Every president gives to the public all their photos, etc., for their library, etc. What has he released? And who in hell voted for him to be the most popular man in 2010? Doesn't this make you wonder? Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from President Obama's past saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc.?? Not one person has ever come forward from his past. It certainly is very, very strange... This should be a cause for great concern. To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced ‘shadow man’. Have you seen the movie, ""The Manchurian Candidate""? As insignificant as each of us might be, someone with whom we went to school will remember our name or face – someone will remember we were the clown or the dork or the brain or the quiet one or the bully – or something about us. George Stephanopoulos of ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign. He questions why no one has acknowledged the president was in their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus. Stephanopoulos also was a classmate of Obama at Columbia -- the class of 1984. He says he never had a single class with him. He is such a great orator – why doesn't anyone in Obama's college class remember him? Why won't he allow Columbia to release his records? Nobody remembers Obama at Columbia University ..... Looking for evidence of Obama's past, Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been there... but none remembered him. Wayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983. In 2008, Root says of Obama – “I don't know a single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I don't have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia , ever."" Nobody recalls him. Root adds that he was also, like Obama, Class of '83 Political Science, and says, ""You don't get more exact or closer than that. Never met him in my life, don't know anyone who ever met him. At the class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class? Me. No one ever heard of Barack! And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class notes, who's kind of the – as we say in New York – 'the macha' who knows everybody, has yet to find a person, a human who ever met him."" Obama's photograph does not appear in the school's yearbook and Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia , provide school records, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia . Some other interesting questions… Why was Obama's law license inactivated in 2002? It is said there is no record of him ever taking the Bar exam. Why was Michelle's law license inactivated by court order? We understand that was forced to avoid fraud charges. It is circulating that according to the U.S. Census, there is only one Barack Obama – but 27 Social Security numbers and over 80 alias connected to him! The Social Security number he uses now originated in Connecticut – but there is no evidence that he ever lived there. And that number was originally registered to another man (Thomas Louis Wood) from Connecticut , who died in Hawaii while on vacation there. As we all know, Social Security numbers are only issued 'once, they are not reused. No wonder all his records are sealed... Please continue sending this out to everyone. Somewhere, someone had to know him....before he ""reorganized"" Chicago and burst upon the scene at the 2004 Democratic Convention. ----",Private
"your guy!!. Who is this guy? did you ever question this yourself? amazing how the news media never cameup with anything, truly suspicious and questionable, don’t you think.? Doesn’t it seem strange that the one man to whom we entrust the most power and responsibility – is surrounded by more mystery than any of us? WHY???????? This came from a union guy in Chicago who didn't vote for Obama – a very interesting perspective that I never thought of in this light. It will be interesting to see what they put in his ""Presidential Library"" about his early years when he is out of office......... In a country where we take notice of many, many facets of our public figures' lives, doesn't it seem odd that there's so little we know about our current president, Barack Obama. For example, we know that Andrew Jackson's wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery, Abe Lincoln never went to school, Jack Kennedy wore a back brace and Harry Truman played the piano. As Americans, we enjoy knowing details about our newsmakers, but none of us know one single humanizing fact about the history of our own president. We are all aware of the lack of uncontestable birth records for Obama – that ‘document managing’ has been spectacularly successful. There are, however, several additional oddities in Obama's history that appear to be as well managed as the birthing issue. One other interesting thing... there are no birth certificates of his daughters that can be found. It's interesting that no one who ever dated him has shown up. The charisma that caused women to be drawn to him so strongly during his campaign certainly would, in the normal course of events, lead some lady to come forward, if only to garner some attention for herself. We all know about JFK's magnetism, that McCain was no monk and quite a few details about Palin's courtship and even her athletic prowess – and Joe Biden's aneurisms are no secret. Look at Cheney and Clinton – we all know about their heart problems. Certainly Wild Bill’s exploits before and during his White House years were well known. That's why it's so odd that not one lady has stepped up and said, ""He was soooo shy..."" or ""What a great dancer..."" It's virtually impossible to know anything about this fellow. Who was the best man at his wedding? Start there. Then check groomsmen. Then get the footage of the graduation ceremony. Has anyone talked to the professors? It is odd that no one is bragging that they knew him or taught him or lived with him. When did he meet Michele, and how? Are there photos there? Every president gives to the public all their photos, etc., for their library, etc. What has he released? And who in hell voted for him to be the most popular man in 2010? Doesn't this make you wonder? Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from President Obama's past saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc.?? Not one person has ever come forward from his past. It certainly is very, very strange... This should be a cause for great concern. To those who voted for him, you may have elected an unqualified, inexperienced ‘shadow man’. Have you seen the movie, ""The Manchurian Candidate""? As insignificant as each of us might be, someone with whom we went to school will remember our name or face – someone will remember we were the clown or the dork or the brain or the quiet one or the bully – or something about us. George Stephanopoulos of ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign. He questions why no one has acknowledged the president was in their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus. Stephanopoulos also was a classmate of Obama at Columbia -- the class of 1984. He says he never had a single class with him. He is such a great orator – why doesn't anyone in Obama's college class remember him? Why won't he allow Columbia to release his records? Nobody remembers Obama at Columbia University ..... Looking for evidence of Obama's past, Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been there... but none remembered him. Wayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983. In 2008, Root says of Obama – “I don't know a single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I don't have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia , ever."" Nobody recalls him. Root adds that he was also, like Obama, Class of '83 Political Science, and says, ""You don't get more exact or closer than that. Never met him in my life, don't know anyone who ever met him. At the class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class? Me. No one ever heard of Barack! And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was.

"The Cantor Rout PROVES We CAN TAKE BACK THE HOUSE! We Need YOU! And POTUS In L.A. Next Month! Moving Forward in 2014 June and July Events Friends: Keeping the Senate is simply a non-negotiable. It is the last firewall against the ridiculous and harmful obstruction we have faced since 2011. And though the pundits may not agree, I still think we can take back the House too -- especially after Tuesday’s loss by Eric Cantor. The Republicans are going even more extreme. But this gets down to three things – money, messaging and turnout. Normally I only ask for your monetary support. But this time, in addition to that, I would like to hear back from you on messaging and a turnout strategy. Every day we hear how we need to improve our messaging. So give me your best “elevator pitch” on why people should vote Democratic. What do we stand for? We know the Republican message – less government, less taxes, less regulations, the free market. What is our 15-30 second message that will resound with the public? Voter turnout was absolutely dismal last Tuesday. How can we get voter turnout during the mid-terms? What would you do? I know a lot of this gets back to messaging. I will forward your comments on - let’s see if we can make a difference. In the meantime here are events that are coming up in June and July. And on July 23rd the President will be in L.A. at Shondra Rhimes home! A not-to-miss event!! If you have any events that you would like me to list please forward the info to me and copy Fred Ascher at fredascher@gmail.com. Thanks so much!

"Daily Skimm: Gotta get up to get down Is this email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser. SHARE THIS SHARE THIS Skimm for November 6th QUOTE OF THE DAY “I had to disabuse him of his belief in zombies” – A British official apparently had to explain to someone that Ebola is not spread by zombies. Glad we’re all on the same page now. Skimm This THE HANGOVER THE STORY This week, voters gave the GOP control of both houses of Congress for the first time in eight years. President Obama said ‘message received.’ THE WHAT The election results showed that even though voters might not be thrilled with the GOP, they’re even less thrilled with Obama. So yesterday, Obama said “I hear you” to everyone who voted (and didn’t vote) in the elections. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the likely next Senate Majority Leader, said he’d already FaceTimed with Obama about things they can work on together. The President said they might even share a bourbon. And perhaps forget that time McConnell said his no. 1 goal was to make Obama a one-term president. Look how well everything’s going already! BUT…? Obama says he’s definitely going to take executive action to overhaul the immigration system by the end of year. Which McConnell says would be “like waving a red flag in front of a bull,” since both parties have been bickering about this hot-button issue for years. Obama also said to prepare for lots of talk on Ebola and ISIS. theSKIMM Obama and McConnell are DC’s newest odd couple. Obama’s hoping to end his presidency on a high note, and McConnell needs to prove that the GOP can get Congress to actually do things. Which means they’ve got to get down with dropping the ‘c’ word: compromise. Skimm This REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING… Jerusalem. Yesterday, two separate cars in the city drove into crowds of Israelis within hours of each other, killing one Israeli and injuring others. At least one of the incidents is being called a “terror attack” and is believed to have been carried out by a Palestinian driver. This comes as tensions have risen over one of Jerusalem’s holiest sites. Jews call it the Temple Mount and Muslims call it the Noble Sanctuary. It’s holy for both religions, but only Muslims are allowed to pray there. Last week, a US-born Jewish activist — who argued that Jews should be allowed to pray at the site too — was shot and wounded, allegedly by a Palestinian man. Israeli police sought out the suspect, and shot and killed him after a confrontation. All this follows a summer of back and forth violence between Israel and terror group Hamas. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR PACKAGE IS LATE… Taxi! Actually though. Yesterday, the WSJ reported that Amazon is testing out taxis to speed up package shipments. The company recently tested this out using taxi-hailing app FlyWheel in San Francisco. No relation to your spinning class. The ‘Zon called in a bunch of taxis, loaded them up with packages, and sent them on their way. Signed, sealed, delivered within an hour. This may be a good way for the company to avoid rising shipping costs in the future, and also give it an edge while Google and eBay are looking to expand their same-day delivery services. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU SET A REMINDER… Here’s another: Gitmo’s still around. President Obama has been trying to close Guantanamo Bay, the US military prison in Cuba, for a looong time. There are still 148 prisoners there. Yesterday, a prisoner from Kuwait, who has been held at Gitmo for 13 years without trial, was released. He got the nickname “forever prisoner” because he was one of the longest-held prisoners, and was never given a trial. You can imagine how well this went over with human rights groups. He was held as a suspected associate of Osama bin Laden. He’s now the first prisoner released from Gitmo since the US exchanged high-level Taliban prisoners for a US soldier being held by the group. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR BOYFRIEND STARTS CROSSFIT… Looking for a competitive advantage? So was A-Rod. Yesterday, the Miami Herald reported that New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez admitted to using performance enhancing drugs while playing for the Yankees. His confession reportedly happened in a meeting with the Drug Enforcement Administration earlier this year. Rodriguez was just reinstated last week, after being suspended for alleged steroid use last year, along with 13 other MLB players. Previously, Rodriguez copped to using ‘roids while playing for the Texas Rangers. But in his testimony to the DEA, he reportedly admits for the first time to using them while playing with the Yankees. Just so we’re clear: his relationship with Madonna was real. Skimm This THING TO KNOW Benedict Cumberbatch: The British actor who plays Sherlock Holmes, and who apparently has a VERY loyal fan base.

Shortly after members of the press were cleared from the conference hall.The revelation came after Mr Cameron pledged that the militant threatening to murder British aid worker David Haines would 'face justice'.

There is growing public pressure for military intervention in Iraq, and direct action against Mr Haines' captors.

"Fwd: FCC Net Neutrality - From today's Politico Begin forwarded message: From: ""Mulvihill, Christina"" <Christina.Mulvihill@am.sony.com> Date: April 25, 2014, 7:13:24 AM PDT To: ""Seligman, Nicole"" <Nicole_Seligman@sonyusa.com> Cc: ""Pearl, Jonathan"" <Jonathan.Pearl@am.sony.com>, ""Weil, Leah"" <Leah_Weil@spe.sony.com> Subject: FCC Net Neutrality - From today's Politico Obama’s past stance in conflict with net neutrality proposal By TONY ROMM | 4/24/14 7:13 PM EDT An FCC net neutrality plan that could empower Internet providers to charge Netflix, Amazon, Facebook and others for faster service clashes with one of President Barack Obama’s oldest campaign promises. Before he arrived at the White House, Obama in 2007 explicitly rejected the possibility that “gatekeepers” someday could “charge different rates to different websites” — a system, he said, that “destroys one of the best things about the Internet — which is that there is this incredible equality there.” Obama’s comment now seems at odds with the so-called fast lanes that might result from the open Internet proposal from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler. But the president still “strongly supports” net neutrality, a White House spokesman stressed Thursday, while declining to comment on the specifics of Wheeler’s plan. Obama hadn’t yet seen the text, added the aide, who also pointed to the fact that the FCC is an independent agency. Meanwhile, old divisions in the familiar net neutrality debate quickly resurfaced on the Hill. Some Democrats, including Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) and Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.), urged the FCC to harden its rule proposal, while House Republicans criticized the telecom agency for trying to impose any requirements at all on Internet providers. “It is well past time for the commission to focus on areas where its work will foster new innovation, competition, and job creation,” said Reps. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) and Greg Walden (R-Ore.). The early divides highlight the difficult politics of net neutrality, a perennial lightning-rod in Internet-policy circles. A constantly warring and partisan Congress renders any legislative fix implausible, even after a January court decision struck down the FCC’s old net neutrality rules. And Wheeler, still a relatively new FCC chairman, risks only more fighting if he imposes on Internet providers the same, strict rules that long have applied to traditional phone companies. Wheeler’s proposed solution prohibits Internet providers from outright blocking websites or content. However, it also creates an opening for those Internet service providers to charge content companies for better access to their pipes. If an Internet provider does so on “commercially unreasonable” terms, then the FCC could take action. Already, the proposed system hasn’t won much support — even among net neutrality’s biggest congressional defenders. “Like many Internet users, I fear that the latest round of proposed net neutrality rules from the FCC will not do enough to curtail discrimination of Internet traffic, but rather leave the door open to discrimination under more ambiguous terms,” said Eshoo, the top Democrat on the House’s leading telecom committee. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), another top net neutrality supporter, stressed the “Internet’s rules of the road must not open up fast lanes to those who can pay, leaving others stuck in traffic.” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, called it a “terribly misguided proposal,” and even wagered its implementation would mean “the Internet as we have come to know it would cease to exist and the average American would be the big loser.” And Franken described the plan as “deeply disappointing and very troubling.” The senator added, “Chairman Wheeler’s proposal would fundamentally change the open nature of the Internet, and I strongly urge him to reconsider this misguided approach.” By and large, GOP reaction Thursday seemed muted — lawmakers still are away on recess, and Wheeler’s proposal isn’t the most onerous legal avenue he could have taken. Still, a few Republican net neutrality opponents slammed the Obama administration once the FCC detailed some of its plans. “We have said repeatedly that the Obama administration’s net neutrality rules are a solution in search of a problem,” said Upton and Walden, the leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its telecom subcommittee, respectively. “The marketplace has thrived and will continue to serve customers and invest billions annually to meet Americans’ broadband needs without these rules.” Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), another regular net neutrality critic, later charged that Wheeler’s plans amount to “regulatory action that could change the future of the Internet as we know it.” But the most closely watched reaction came from the White House. An Obama administration spokesman said Thursday that the president has been “clear from the start that we support” the open Internet. The aide said the president would be “closely following these developments as the FCC launches its proceeding.” Read more: http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/net-neutrality-fcc-barack-obama-106011.html#ixzz2zuJSJ9jD Christina Mulvihill Senior Director, External Relations Sony Corporation of America 1667 K Street, NW Suite 825 Washing",Private

Still, a few Republican net neutrality opponents slammed the Obama administration once the FCC detailed some of its plans. “We have said repeatedly that the Obama administration’s net neutrality rules are a solution in search of a problem,” said Upton and Walden, the leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and its telecom subcommittee, respectively. “The marketplace has thrived and will continue to serve customers and invest billions annually to meet Americans’ broadband needs without these rules.” Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), another regular net neutrality critic, later charged that Wheeler’s plans amount to “regulatory action that could change the future of the Internet as we know it.” But the most closely watched reaction came from the White House. An Obama administration spokesman said Thursday that the president has been “clear from the start that we support” the open Internet. The aide said the president would be “closely following these developments as the FCC launches its proceeding.” Read more: http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/net-neutrality-fcc-barack-obama-106011.html#ixzz2zuJSJ9jD Christina Mulvihill Senior Director, External Relations Sony Corporation of America 1667 K Street, NW Suite 825 Washington, DC 20006 202-429-3653 office 202-487-4449 mobile",Private

And in response to continued political upheaval in the region, on July 16, 2014, OFAC announced it was both expanding the scope of these sanctions and further adding to the number of sanctioned individuals and entities.[i] Through two Directives[ii] issued pursuant to E.O. 13662,[iii] which on March 20, 2014 authorized sectoral-based sanctions against the Russian Federation, OFAC has placed limited sanctions on four entities in the Russian financial services and energy sectors and identified these entities on a newly-published Sectoral Sanctions Identification List (""SSI List"").[iv] In addition, OFAC expanded the list of SDNs pursuant to E.O.s 13660[v] and E.O. 13661[vi] which authorized Treasury to sanction individuals and entities that threaten the peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as persons who operate in the arms or related materiel sectors in the Russian Federation. To date, Treasury has primarily used E.O.s 13660 and 13661 to target Ukrainian separatists, Russian Federation officials and oligarchs, and corporations associated with these individuals. As the crisis continues to unfold, OFAC may continue to place additional individuals and entities on the SDN List or SSI List, and may expand the scope of the sanctions applicable to those entities placed on the SSI List. In addition, OFAC may begin undertaking enforcement actions against U.S. companies who violate the prohibitions set forth in the Executive Orders described above. U.S. companies should pay close attention to further announcements by OFAC and ensure that they comply with the requirements of these E.O.s. The European Union (EU) and several countries in addition to the U.S. also have continued to expand their sanctions programs in response to the situation in Ukraine. These individuals and entities sanctioned by foreign governments may or may not overlap with U.S. sanctions. U.S. persons with operations in Europe or elsewhere who are subject to foreign legal authority should ensure that they are complying with local sanctions laws in addition to screening for persons designated by OFAC. Upon request, a complete country-by-country comparison of sanctions actions and a list of sanctioned individuals and entities may be obtained from Gibson Dunn attorneys. E.O. 13662 and the SSI List As discussed in detail in our previous client alert on this subject,[vii] E.O. 13662 significantly expanded the President's authority to target Russian persons, regardless of whether they are determined to threaten the peace, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The E.O. authorized OFAC to sanction any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury to operate in particular sectors of the Russian Federation economy, such as financial services, energy, metals and mining, engineering, and defense and related materiel.[viii] OFAC's July 16, 2014 issuance of the two Directives pursuant to E.O. 13662 was the first exercise of this authority. Directive 1 prohibits U.S. persons from transacting in, providing financing for, or otherwise dealing in (i) new debt with longer than 90 days maturity or (ii) new equity for SSI-listed entities in the Russian financial services sector, these entities' property, or their interests in property. It also prohibits any such transactions which occur in the United States. Two Russian banks were designated in Directive 1: Vnesheconombank (Bank for Development and Foreign Economic Affairs), or VEB, and Gazprombank. Directive 2 addresses the Russian energy sector and prohibits U.S. persons from transacting in, providing financing for, or otherwise dealing in new debt of longer than 90 days maturity for SSI-listed entities, their property, or their interests in property. Directive 2 also prohibits any such transactions which occur in the United States. The two Russian companies so listed are Novatek and Rosneft. For the purposes of the SSI List, debt is considered to include bonds, loans, extensions of credit, loan guarantees, letters of credit, drafts, bankers acceptances, discount notes or bills or commercial paper. Equity includes stocks, share issuances, depositary receipts or any other evidence of title or ownership. The prohibitions also extend to debt issued by entities owned 50% or more by the four named entities (and to equity issued by entities owned 50% or more by the two banks identified in Directive 1). OFAC clarified that identification of these four entities on the SSI List does not prohibit (i) transactions in debt or equity that was issued prior to July 16, 2014, (ii) transactions dealing in new equity instruments for the two companies identified in Directive 2 and (iii) U.S. financial institutions from maintaining correspondent accounts and processing U.S. dollar-clearing transactions (so long as such activities do not involve dealing in the prohibited transaction types). Note that OFAC Frequently Asked Question (""FAQ"") #370 states that the prohibitions under Directive 1 of E.O. 13662 extend to transactions and dealings by U.S. persons or within the U.S. in new debt with a maturity of longer than 90 days and equity by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of the persons operating in Russia' financial sector named on the SSI List, their property and their interests in property.[ix] Similar language is found in the FAQ relating to new debt for energy sector entities included on the SSI List pursuant to Directive 2.[x] Therefore, the language of the FAQ would seem to indicate that even if a letter of credit, for example, is not issued to SSI-listed entities, it could still be prohibited if it is issued by or for the benefit these entities. However, this broad language in the FAQ--""by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of""--is inconsistent with the language of the Directives, which instead use the word ""for."" The latter construction would likely have a much narrower effect and likely would be interpreted to limit the prohibitions of Directives 1 and 2 to cover debt and equity transactions more directly tied to the SSI-listed entities. Unofficial guidance from OFAC officials has indicated that the correct language should indeed be ""for,"" and that the FAQ will be updated accordingly. Note as well that the property and interests in property of those persons identified on the SSI List are not blocked unless those persons are also designated as SDNs. Rather, U.S. persons must reject transactions or dealings that are prohibited under these Directives. Additional Designations Pursuant to its authority under E.O.s 13660 and 13661, OFAC added five individuals and 11 entities to the SDN List. As with other designated individuals and entities, U.S. persons are now generally prohibited from conducting transactions or dealings with any of the following: Individuals: BESEDA, Sergey - Commander of the Fifth Service of the FSB; Commander of the Service for Operational Information and International Communications of the FSB; FSB Colonel General; Colonel-General BORODAI, Aleksandr - Leader of pro-Russia separatists in Donetsk, Ukraine (the ""Donetsk People's Republic"") NEVEROV, Sergei Ivanovich - Deputy Chairman of the State Duma of the Russian Federation; Member of the State Duma Committee on Housing Policy and Housing and Communal Services SAVELYEV, Oleg Genrikhovich - Minister for Crimean Affairs SHCHEGOLEV, Igor - Aide to the President of the Russian Federation Entities: DONETSK PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC FEDERAL STATE UNITARY ENTERPRISE STATE RESEARCH AND PRODUCTION ENTERPRISE BAZALT FEODOSIYA ENTERPRISE JOINT STOCK COMPANY CONCERN RADIO-ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES JOINT STOCK COMPANY CONCERN SOZVEZDIE JOINT STOCK COMPANY MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL CORPORATION NPO MASHINOSTROYENIA JOINT STOCK COMPANY CONCERN ALMAZ-ANTEY KALASHNIKOV CONCERN KONSTRUKTORSKOE BYURO PRIBOROSTROENIYA OTKRYTOE AKTSIONERNOE OBSHCHESTVO (INSTRUMENT DESIGN BUREAU) LUHANSK PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC URALVAGONZAVOD Implications and Recommendations By creating the SSI List--as well as designating additional persons--the United States significantly increased the pressure on Russia to cease its activities in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. The imposition of these sanctions--which primarily target certain Russian companies' access to U.S. financial and capital markets--was the result of Russia's unwillingness to relinquish its control over Crimea and its continued support of separatist activities in Ukraine. As the crisis continues to escalate, with the recent crash of a Malaysia Airlines passenger aircraft reportedly shot down by Russian-supplied separatists in eastern Ukraine,[xi] as well as cross-border shelling and Russian military incursions into eastern Ukraine,[xii] additional sanctions may be likely. U.S. persons--as well as companies considering conducting transactions in the United States--should be cautious in conducting any transactions with those entities listed on the SSI List, and should continue to utilize rigorous compliance systems to ensure that they are not transacting with SDNs. Looking ahead, U.S. companies should be aware of at least two potential developments. First, U.S. companies should ensure that they are in compliance with the new directives on the SSI List, as well as closely monitor any additional designations, Executive Orders, legislation, or regulations. Second, U.S. companies--or foreign companies that conduct transactions in the United States--should be cautious about conducting any business with companies on the SSI List. OFAC has not yet commenced public enforcement proceedings against U.S. persons for violating the recent sanctions on Russia, but may be looking to show that these sanctions have teeth. U.S. companies should avoid engaging in any activities that could run afoul of OFAC regulations and that garner significant public attention, as this may result in increased OFAC scrutiny. _____ [i] Press Release, U.S. Department of the Treasury, Announcement of Treasury Sanctions on Entities Within the Financial Services and Energy Sectors of Russia, Against Arms or Related Materiel Entities, and those Undermining Ukraine's Sovereignty (July 16, 2014), available at http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2572.aspx.

SHARE THIS SHARE THIS Skimm for September 17th QUOTE OF THE DAY “It’s an honor to accept the role of UN Messenger of Peace on Climate Change ” – Leonardo DiCaprio is now the Messenger of Peace. His first act of solving all our problems will be to ensure that all wooden planks can fit two people. Skimm This THINGS EVERYONE WOULD LOVE TO STOP TALKING ABOUT ISIS THE STORY Yesterday, a top US official said he’s not ruling out sending ground troops to Iraq. COME AGAIN? Since US airstrikes started against ISIS in Iraq last month, President Obama has said that there will be no US ground troops in combat. Last week, Obama reiterated this in an address to the nation, saying “we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq.” Now, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said he’d advise Obama to send some US military ground forces if necessary. Meanwhile, late yesterday ISIS released a video in response to Obama’s promise to “destroy” the group. The video looks like a Hollywood trailer and appears to be a warning to the US about sending ground troops. theSKIMM Some in Washington think it will “take an army to beat an army” and US combat troops may be the only way to get rid of ISIS for good. But for many, talk like this brings back painful memories and fears that history is repeating itself. UKRAINE THE STORY Yesterday, Ukraine signed a deal to get closer to the EU. Long time coming… BACK UP. TELL ME THE STORY. Once upon a time last November, Ukraine’s economy was looking like you on a Sunday morning. A lot of people thought a trade deal with the EU could help. But Ukraine’s president ‘decided’ (or Russia decided) he’d rather get closer to Russia. Massive protests erupted, and Mr. President got voted out in February. Then, Russia annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists hoped the same would happen for them in the East. Fighting started. MH17 was shot down. Everyone wrote hate mail to Putin. And Ukraine became an international ‘ugh.’ WHAT NOW? Ukraine’s new prez is signing the trade deal with the EU, which is exactly what everyone wanted in the first place. theSKIMM For those asking why this couldn’t just have happened last year, Donetsk. REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU SPILL YOUR COFFEE… Fumble. Just like Roger Goodell. The NFL Commissioner has spent the last week trying to ignore calls for his resignation over his handling of the Ray Rice situation. Now, the NFL Players Association, on behalf or Rice, is appealing Goodell’s decision to suspend Rice…and it wants the commish to stay out of it. The Association says it has facts that suggest a “lack of a fair and impartial process” led to Rice’s indefinite suspension. Meanwhile, today the Minnesota Vikings decided to indefinitely bar star running back Adrian Peterson from team activities until his child-abuse case is resolved. Earlier this week, the Vikings decided they were going to let him play, but got a lot of pressure from fans and sponsors to keep him off the field. And speaking of, major NFL sponsor Anheuser-Busch says the Clydesdale is sad and that they are “disappointed and increasingly concerned” by what’s been going on. Hear that? That’s the sound of NFL execs reaching for a Bud. WHAT TO SAY WHEN IT’S RAINING OUTSIDE… Womp womp. The UN gave everybody an update on the Ebola situation in West Africa yesterday, and it wasn’t good. The highlights? The number of people affected by Ebola is rising at an “almost exponential” rate — half of the infections have happened in the last month — and the countries at the center of the outbreak could soon be unable to distribute basic needs. Bottom line? The UN says it’s going to cost $1 billion to contain Ebola, and the international community has to act fast. And speaking of, yesterday President Obama announced he’s sending about 3,000 military personnel to help train health workers and build new treatment centers. More than 2,400 people have died of Ebola so far. WHAT TO SAY WHEN UBER SAYS THERE’S A 10-MINUTE WAIT… Wish I could take a space taxi instead. Yesterday, NASA awarded $6.8 billion to Boeing and SpaceX to build ‘space taxis’ that will take US astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS). NASA’s space launches from the US were retired in 2011, and since then, US astronauts have been hitching a ride with the Russians to get to the ISS. NASA says that Obama’s made it clear that “the greatest nation on Earth should not be dependent on other nations to get into space.” Also, car pooling with Putin isn’t so fun. The gum-drop shaped pods are being called the next era of spacecraft, and could be ready to go by 2017. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU HEAR ‘HEY GIRL’… Baby Gosling has arrived.

"Steven Sotloff: Isis video claims to show beheading of US journalistUS intelligence officials working to establish authenticity of video of Sotloff being killed, reportedly by the same fighter who murdered James FoleySteven Sotloff’s mother begs Isis for kidnapped son’s returnCameron: Isis beheading ‘disgusting and despicable’ – latest707comments US journalist Steven Sotloff is pictured in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters. Photograph: ReutersPaul Lewis in Washington, Spencer Ackerman in New York and Ian Cobain in LondonWednesday 3 September 2014 02.36 EDTIslamic militants released a video on Tuesday that purported to show the beheading of a second captive American journalist, Steven Sotloff, which ended with a chilling warning that a British hostage would be the next to die.In a video, entitled A Second Message to America, a masked man is shown carrying out the decapitation of Sotloff, whose life had earlier been threatened in a film that showed the murder of another American journalist, James Foley.AdvertisementThe video, released by the Islamic State (Isis) on Tuesday, features a voiceover delivered by a British jihadi with a ­distinctive London accent, apparently the same man who was filmed beheading Foley two weeks ago. It ends with the killer threatening another hostage, identified as a Briton.Jabbing his serrated knife towards the camera, the masked man is shown declaring: “I’m back, Obama.”US officials said intelligence experts had begun work on establishing the authenticity of the video, which runs for two minutes and 50 seconds. The British prime minister David Cameron condemned the killing as a “despicable act”. Sotloff’s family issued a statement saying it believed he had been killed.AdvertisementState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the US had seen “reports of a video that purports to be of the murder” of Sotloff.“The intelligence community will work as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity,” she said. “If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act taking the life of another innocent American citizen. Our hearts go out to the Sotloff family.”In the video, seen by the Guardian, Sotloff appears on his knees – his hands tied behind his back – beside a man holding a serrated knife, reminiscent of the one shown in the Foley video.The masked fighter indicated he was the same man who murdered Foley, saying: “I’m back, Obama, and I’m back because of your arrogant foreign policy toward the Islamic State.”The video was recorded in desolate desert landscape that resembled the location in which Foley was murdered, although the latest video showed a flatter terrain. It is unclear when it was made, but it appears to be recent: the masked killer makes reference to recent US bombings in Iraq, including the airstrikes near Amerli that began on Saturday. Sotloff’s hair and his beard are also longer than in the Foley video, in which Sotloff also appeared.In the latest video, Sotloff is dressed in an orange jumpsuit, apparently mimicking the ones once used at Guantánamo Bay, and is made to deliver a statement blaming Obama for his murder. The killer states: “You, Obama, have yet again, through your actions, killed yet another American citizen.” He then appears to slice Sotloff’s throat.The black-masked killer again urges Obama to cease his bombing campaign in Iraq, and says that if the US does not cease bombing, “our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people”.The warning is extended to governments that might join the the “evil” actions of the US against Isis. It is around this point that the video cuts to another kneeling captive, stated to be a British national.British intelligence officials have been working urgently to try to identify Foley’s killer, reportedly using sophisticated voice recognition techniques to help narrow down a list of potential British jihadi suspects.UK government sources said that an early analysis of the video suggested that the British man whose voice issued this threat was the same man heard on the video that depicted the murder of Foley.The Obama administration revealed two weeks ago that US special operations forces conducted a risky and ultimately unsuccessful raid inside Syria intended to free American hostages, who were determined to not be at the location targeted. A video purportedly showing US journalist Steven Sotloff kneeling next to an Islamic State fighter. Photograph: ReutersAdministration officials have discussed US hostages held by Isis in plural terms, but have never confirmed that Sotloff or any other specific person was intended to be freed.However on Tuesday, in brief, off-the-cuff remarks delivered as news of the video was breaking, the White House press secretary Josh Earnest appeared to indicate Sotloff may have been among the hostages Washington tried to free.“The United States has ... dedicated significant time and resources to try and rescue Mr Sotloff,” Earnest said.By Monday, the US had conducted 123 airstrikes against Isis positions, artillery and vehicles since 8 August. The campaign has now extended to providing humanitarian relief to besieged Shia Turkmen in the Iraqi city of Amerli, a weekend expansion that underscored the Obama administration’s determination to continue its war against Isis, despite Foley’s killing and the threat to Sotloff’s life.That airdrop of water and food was accompanied by US airstrikes on Isis positions around Amerli, said Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman. “Further airstrikes remain a possibility, but we believe the township is under the control of Iraqi and Kurdish forces,” Kirby said Tuesday.Sotloff, 31, a freelance journalist from Miami, Florida, disappered near the Syrian-Turkish border in August last year while working for the Time and Foreign Policy magazines.A spokesman for Sotloff’s family said: “The family knows of this horrific tragedy and is grieving privately. There will be no public comment from the family during this difficult time.” Last week Sotloff’s mother Shirley had pleaded with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leaser of the Islamic State, for the release of her son, whom she described as an innocent journalist.She recorded the plea after the video of Foley’s killing last month was released. In that film, Foley’s killer said her son would be next in line if the militant group’s demands were not met.Tuesday’s video followed a similar pattern. It finished with footage of the British hostage, in the same style of orange jumpsuit that both Foley and Sotloff were wearing, suggesting he was their next intended victim.Finally, with the Briton still in shot, the masked killer states: “Back off and leave our people alone.” A caption identifies the man, although the foreign office in London requested that his name not be published at this time.At Downing Street, Cameron denounced the apparent killing of Sotloff: “If verified, this is a despicable and barbaric murder. My thoughts and prayers are with Mr Sotloff’s family and friends tonight as they deal with this appalling and tragic situation.“As I have said consistently over the last few weeks, Isil terrorists speak for no religion. They threaten Syrians, Iraqis, Americans and British people alike and make no distinction between Muslims, Christians or any other faith.”Cameron will chair a meeting of the British government’s emergency response committee, Cobra, on Wednesday to consider responses to the killing and the threat to the British hostage. He has said that he believes the West faces a “generational struggle” against the extremist ideology of the Islamic State, even suggesting it to be a more dangerous force than al-Qaida.The militant shown in the video has identified himself to hostages who were subsequently freed as “John”, and is believed to be the ringleader of three British jihadists thought to be the main guards of foreign nationals in Raqqa, a stronghold of Islamic State fighters. One former hostage, who was held for a year in Raqqa, told the Guardian John is intelligent, educated and a devout believer in radical Islamic teachings. He and his two British friends were referred to as “the Beatles” by fellow hostages because of their nationality, the former captive said.Sir Peter Westmacott, the British ambassador to the US, has said that the UK and US intelligence agencies are close to identifying John, using voice-recognition technology.Additional reporting by Martin Chulov and Mustafa KhaliliTags: Islamic State (Isis), United States, Syria, Iraq, Middle East and North Africa, more…Share via EmailShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on Google+",Private
"Daily Skimm: Hey there, Friday Is this email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser. SHARE THIS SHARE THIS Skimm for November 7th Skimm’d while watching “Scandal.” We like to multi-task. QUOTE OF THE DAY “A Body for Every Body” – Victoria’s Secret renamed its new campaign title because “The Perfect Body” didn’t go over so well. Go figure. Skimm This ARE YOU THERE, IRAN? IT'S ME... THE STORY Turns out President Obama has a secret pen-pal in Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. So there’s that. WHAT’S THE DEAL? This is believed to be the fourth time Obama’s written to Khamenei. The buck stops with the Ayatollah, and he’s the one who makes the call on important decisions in Iran. Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, is more of a figurehead. Which is unfortunate, since he appears to be the one more willing to work with the West. WHY’D OBAMA WRITE THIS TIME? He wants Iran to help out in the fight against ISIS. But that’s only if Iran is also willing to reach a nuclear deal with the US and friends by Nov 24th. Iran maintains that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but everyone else has been saying ‘ha, no,’ for years. Meanwhile, getting Khamenei on board with the ISIS fight might not be an easy sell — this is the same man who recently called Obama’s ISIS-fighting coalition “absurd, hollow, and biased.” But he’s also interested in bringing down ISIS, since Iran’s the dominant Shiite power in the Mideast, and ISIS is Sunni-led. WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING? House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) would like Obama to find a new pen-pal; he said he doesn’t trust the Iranians and they shouldn’t be brought into the fight against ISIS. The US’s Middle-Eastern allies are worried that Obama flirting with Iran could come at the expense of a softened nuclear deal. theSKIMM This was a big ol’ reminder over just how important Obama views Iran to be when it comes to dealing with ISIS. Skimm This REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR FRIEND DISCOVERS PHOTO STREAM… Welcome to the 2000s Mr. Baaaanks. Yesterday, Microsoft finally decided it’s time to make Office – aka Word, Excel, PowerPoint – available for free 99 on all mobile devices. Microsoft has been holding onto control of Office, a major cash cow, for forever. It even made Office available only on its own smartphones to push sales. But when’s the last time you saw a Windows Phone on the subway? Meanwhile everyone’s moved from PCs to mobile sans Office, and Apple and Google have free software of their own. But Microsoft’s new CEO Satya Nadella is betting a push into cloud and mobile computing is going to bring the tech giant out of dial-up speed. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU CAN’T PASS THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU… Roadblock. Yesterday, a federal appeals court upheld bans on same-sex marriage in four states. The justices ruled that states should be in charge of deciding when they’re ready to let couples cut the rainbow wedding cake. The ruling breaks a trend — over the last few months other federal appeals courts have struck down similar bans across the US. Yesterday’s decision is likely to be appealed before the Supreme Court. We’re sure the Supremes are thrilled, since last month they said ‘thanks, but no thanks‘ to weighing in once and for all on gay marriage. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU HEAR ‘IF AT FIRST YOU DON’T SUCCEED’… Don’t try again. Yesterday, US and international authorities announced they’d shut down Silk Road 2.0, an anonymous drug market on the Interwebs. The original Silk Road was seized last year. It could only be accessed using an online anonymity software, and was reportedly selling millions of dollars worth of illegal goodies to more than 100,000 users. This one followed in its footsteps and authorities asked everyone to stop trying to make Silk Road happen, it’s not going to happen. Silk Road 2.0′s creator, Blake “Defcon” Benthall now faces a lot of the same “conspiracy” charges as Silk Road 1.0′s creator, Ross “Dread Pirate Roberts” Ulbricht. Making us all feel pressure to get better pirate name generators. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU HEAR ‘ROBERT O’NEILL’… It’s the name you’re not really supposed to know, but you do. This week, the former Navy SEAL told The Washington Post that he was the SEAL known as “the shooter” who fired the fatal shots that killed Osama bin Laden. There are varying accounts of how it all went down, but multiple shots were fired by different SEALs. Two years ago, another ex-SEALs member said he was the one who fired the first shot on bin Laden. Some in the military say it was actually a third shooter. It’s SEALs’ tradition not to seek recognition for individual actions, and since the 2011 raid, most of the names of the SEALs on that mission were a secret. O’Neill says he decided to go public with his story because he believed his identity was about to be leaked anyway. Then, earlier this week a military blog disclosed his name. O’Neill is a decorated Iraq and Afghan war vet, and also participated in the 2009 mission to rescue Captain Phillips from pirates. And now Hollywood can make a third movie about him.

SHARE THIS SHARE THIS Skimm for November 20th Skimm’d with a side of Netflix QUOTE OF THE DAY “Without gravity, bodily fluids move toward your head. It’s a great face-lift” – Former NASA astronaut Marsha Ivins, telling us all about that no-gravity life. Skimm This THE WELCOME MAT THE STORY Tonight, President Obama is going to tell us about executive actions he’s taking to overhaul the US immigration system. WHAT’S HE GONNA DO? Obama is expected to take steps to keep about five million undocumented immigrants from being deported. This includes parents of children who are US citizens, and people who have been in the US for a long time and don’t have a criminal record. SO CONGRESS IS PASSING A NEW LAW? Ha. You political novice, you. Obama has been waiting for years for Congress to pass a sweeping immigration reform law. But since Godot never showed up, the president pulled out his presidential handbook and realized he could do a couple of EAs. WHICH IS WHAT? Executive actions, otherwise known as ‘I do what I want.’ Immigration reform is one of the most polarizing issues in politics, and Congress has struggled for years to find a solution that works for both sides of the aisle…and lost a few along the way because of it. More than a few people are pointing out that the president is breaking his own rules by using executive actions. WHAT RULES? Obama once said taking executive action on immigration reform would be “violating our laws,” “not an option,” and “very difficult to defend legally.” Now, the White House says its plan is totally legit. The irony is not lost on Republicans, who say this is SO not allowed. They’re also wondering if Obama forgot voters gave them control of Congress, and are working on a strategy to stop him. theSKIMM Obama says he’d be open to canceling these executive actions in the future if Congress passes a bipartisan immigration bill. But that is very, very unlikely. If you thought Obama and the new GOP-controlled Congress would start singing Kumbaya together anytime soon, you were mistaken. Skimm This REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING… Florida State University. After midnight ET this morning, a gunman opened fire at one of FSU’s campus libraries. He was then shot and killed by police, after firing shots on them when they ordered him to drop his weapon. Three people were wounded, with at least one in critical condition. The library was packed at the time. Students described fleeing, barricading themselves in parts of the building, or taking cover. FSU gave the “all clear” around 4am. The campus will be open today, but classes are canceled. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU HEAR DON LEMON’S ADVICE… Mrs. Huxtable would have soooo many thoughts right now. Yesterday, both NBC and Netflix said they’re tabling plans for Bill Cosby projects, after sexual assault allegations against the comedian have gotten attention in recent weeks. NBC’s canceled its family sitcom with Cosby and Netflix postponed plans for a comedy special. Even TV Land is reportedly pulling “The Cosby Show” re-runs from its lineup. 15 women have now accused Cosby of sexual assault, with old allegations resurfacing in recent weeks. Most recently, former model Janice Dickinson came forward, saying Cosby drugged and assaulted her in the 80s. Cosby’s lawyer denied Dickinson’s allegations, and earlier this week, he said Cosby wouldn’t dignify old accusations with a comment. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU TEXT YOUR FRIEND “I’M ON MY WAY”… Does Uber know I’m still in bed? Uber’s come under some fire this week for its “God View” tracking tool. Yup, it’s a thing. The tool lets Uber employees track the locations of customers who’ve requested a car. This data’s supposed to be used only for “legitimate business purposes.” But earlier this month, a BuzzFeed News reporter claims the company tracked her ride for not-so-legitimate purposes. She reportedly arrived at Uber’s offices in Long Island to find Uber’s NY general manager waiting for her outside, where he apparently told her, “I was tracking you.” Always a good first line. The reporter says she did not give him permission to creep like that. Uber says it’s looking into the incident. This comes days after an Uber exec stepped in it by suggesting the company should dig up dirt on reporters who’ve been critical of the company. Happy Thanksgiving, Uber PR team. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN THERE’S SNOW IN NOVEMBER… Santa! I know him! Nope, you’re not in the North Pole. You’re in Buffalo. The Great Lakes area is experiencing a serious amount of snow. Buffalo, NY has been hit with more than five feet this week…and it’s not over. Another two to three feet could drop by today. Seven people there have died in storm-related accidents. Buffalo’s not the only city getting hit with the big chill. Parts of Wisconsin and Michigan are still listening to ‘let it snow, let it snow, let it snow’ on repeat. Yesterday, there was brief pause in the storm but it’s supposed to ramp up again tomorrow. This week, all 50 states hit below freezing temps at some point. Your calendar’s not a liar — it’s still November. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR EX GETS ENGAGED… Another one bites the dust. JetBlue, the only airline that lets you stretch out and eat free Terra chips in coach, is scaling back on its perks. They’re now adding checked baggage fees on some flights and reducing leg room. Other airlines have been doing this for years, but JetBlue held out to keep the flyers happy. JetBlue shareholders are flying high though, since this means more money in the bank — $450 million more by 2017. You were my boy, Blue.

Skimm This THINGS REVVING UP ISIS THE STORY ISIS’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi popped up in a new video yesterday to let everyone know that, contrary to popular belief, he is very much alive. Oh, and ISIS and al-Qaeda have decided to join forces in Syria. SAY WHAT? ISIS used to be affiliated with al-Qaeda, but they had a falling out after al-Qaeda decided ISIS was way too extreme for its taste. The two have been fighting ever since in Syria’s multi-front civil war against President Assad. Yesterday, the Associated Press reported that ISIS and al-Qaeda grabbed brunch, hashed out their feud, and agreed to team up once again. To combat ISIS, the US has been supporting moderate rebels. Now, those rebels will also have to deal with al-Qaeda. theSKIMM ISIS’s leader also used yesterday’s comeback video to call for attacks against the rulers of Saudi Arabia. This is a friendly reminder that ISIS has ambitions that go way beyond Syria and Iraq. IMMIGRATION THE STORY President Obama’s just about ready to use executive action to overhaul the US immigration system. And he could do it as early as next week. Dun dun dun. WHAT’S THE RUSH? Immigration reform has always been near the top of Obama’s to-do list. But Congress hasn’t been able to figure out a solution that works for both sides of the aisle. Earlier this year, Obama said he was ready to go-it alone. But then he decided to table reform until after the midterms to save Dems from political backlash. The Republicans won anyway, but Obama still wants to get it done before the end of the year. WHAT’S OBAMA PLANNING? He’s expected to let parents with children who are US citizens get legal work documents, so they won’t have to worry about being deported. He’s also reportedly ready to set clear priorities for deportations – meaning criminals and people who have just crossed the border would have to leave before someone who’s been here a long time and doesn’t have a criminal record. These, plus additional new policies, could keep millions of undocumented immigrants from being deported. theSKIMM Now that the Republicans are in charge of Congress, it’s going to be even harder for the president to pass the kind of immigration reform he’s been looking for. Meaning it seems that Obama’s going to lean on executive action now, more than ever. REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU FINALLY GET A REZ AT THAT NEW RESTAURANT… Boom. Yesterday, Amazon and book publisher Hachette finally reached a deal after fighting for months over things like e-book pricing. Amazon made life more difficult for the company and its authors by removing preorder buttons on Hachette titles and delaying shipment of some books. Amazon reportedly wanted a bigger cut of e-book revenue and lower prices, while Hachette said it needed to keep prices up to protect its business. In the new agreement, Amazon agreed to let Hachette set e-book prices, but also gave the publisher incentives to keep prices lower. This comes just in time for the all-important holiday season. Here comes the cheer. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR PHONE… There’s find my iPhone, and then there’s this. Yesterday, the WSJ reported that the US Justice Department is using planes to track the cellphones of criminals on the ground. The program uses Cessna planes equipped with devices that basically act like cell towers and can collect unique info from cell phones, including location, as they fly overhead. This method is similar to the NSA’s as both take a needle-in-a-haystack approach to getting intel at times. Details on the NSA’s methods freaked everyone out after a certain Shmedward Bowden spilled them last year. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE SAYS “WE’LL CALL YOU FROM THE LANDLINE”… Is that still a thing? Gay and bisexual men still aren’t allowed to donate blood in the US. Yesterday, a panel recommended to the FDA for the first time that the ban should be partially lifted. The ban was put into place in the early 80s during the AIDS crisis because it’s possible to transmit HIV through blood transfusions. Blood-donation advocates argue that the ban perpetuates the stereotype that gay and bisexual men have HIV/AIDS. Groups like the Red Cross think that a full ban goes too far, and there should instead be a partial ban that lets gay and bisexual men donate one year after their last same-sex encounter. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU’RE ON LOW BATTERY… Remember when they were replaceable? The only person still chasing old-school batteries is Warren Buffett. Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, is buying battery maker Duracell from Procter & Gamble. Berkshire will turn over $4.7 billion of P&G shares they currently hold, and walk away with a lifetime supply of batteries, plus $1.7 billion in cash. Buffett loves him some traditional consumer businesses and deals that give him a tax break. This is both. The deal also reflects a trend of Berkshire buying companies rather than just investing in stocks. Add batteries to its list of conquests. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR FRIEND SAYS THE WEATHER’S BEEN WEIRD… In other shocking news, yesterday Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was voted Senate Majority Leader. Last week, Republicans grabbed the Senate by the ballots and picked up at least eight seats. McConnell already had his drapes picked out, but now he’ll officially move them into his new office in January. He says he’s ready to wake up Congress with a shot of “real legislative accomplishments.” Meanwhile, the Dems have exhausted the tissue supply and are getting things done too. No surprise, Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) is still the party’s top dog, but there was also a new leadership position created for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). Skimm This THING TO KNOW Acai: Pronounced “ah-sah-ee.” Now you know. Also really good for you. It’s a purple berry found in juices and those bowls at the juice place.

Scratch one from the Bucket List.” – Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist finalizing his vacation plans. THINGS NOT HIDING THEIR FEELINGS HOUSE REPUBLICANS THE STORY Yesterday, House Republicans unwrapped their plan to deal with the surge of child immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border. Spoiler alert: it’s not what President Obama was hoping for. WHAT’S THE PLAN? Earlier this month, Obama asked Congress for $3.7 billion to deal with tens of thousands of children from Central America crossing the southern border. The House GOP is offering $659 million. Put away your calculator. $659 million does not equal $3.7 billion. Like Obama had hoped, the plan would give the US the OK to quickly deport the kids back home. But it’s not as much money as Obama would like and Democrats just hate the idea altogether. The House is set to vote on it tomorrow. Just in time for Congress’s five-week summer vacation. ANYTHING ELSE? All this teamwork comes just when there’s some DC talk about whether Republicans will or won’t try to impeach Obama for doing too many things without Congress. Yes, impeach. The GOP said it’s just the Dems stirring the pot to raise some money for the midterm elections. The Dems spit out their table wine and said did we just hear you say impeachment? theSKIMM “Summer break” in an election year means “campaign time.” Which means everyone has to go back home and face voters. Republicans will show voters some proof that they tackled immigration…even though the bill has no chance of passing the Dem-run Senate…where Dems will also have to face voters at home. #TheGame Skimm ThisLike UsTweet with Us _____ THE US & FRIENDS THE STORY The US and its European friends are really, really over Putin and his meddling in Ukraine. So yesterday they slapped Russia with some heavy sanctions. HAVEN’T I SEEN THIS PLAY BEFORE? Yes. The US and EU aren’t happy with Russia trying to destabilize Ukraine, so they’ve been doling out sanctions – mostly on individuals and organizations tied to the conflict. But the Europeans haven’t loved the idea of getting too harsh with Russia since it could hurt their economies too. Then MH17 went down over eastern Ukraine, and the US presented evidence that it was pro-Russian separatists, likely using a Russian missile. Now the Europeans are targeting entire sectors of Russia’s economy, like the oil and banking industries. It’s not the best news for Putin & Co. since Russia’s economy isn’t exactly going gangbusters right now. theSKIMM President Obama says this is “not a new Cold War.” But the crisis in Ukraine is like leaking kerosene all over decades of fake smiles between Russia and the US. Skimm ThisLike UsTweet with Us REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU SEE ANOTHER MIDEAST FACEBOOK STATUS… Well, Israel and Hamas are still going at it. Yesterday, Israeli strikes hit Hamas’s TV station, the home of one of its top leaders, and Gaza’s only power plant. What does this mean for civilians? Many of them already living in poverty are now without electricity or running water. What does this mean for Hamas militants? It’s a symbolic blow to the group’s control over the area. Hamas has continued to launch rockets into Israel. The international community is still pushing for a cease-fire, and for half a second yesterday it looked like Palestinian Authority President Abbas was into the idea. But Hamas is still saying there won’t be a cease-fire until Israel’s blockade on Gaza is lifted. Israel still wants Gaza demilitarized. So no, still not over. Meanwhile, this morning a UN school being used as a shelter in Gaza was hit, killing at least 15. Skimm ThisLike UsTweet with Us WHAT TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE SAYS ‘LOL’… Never OK.

Yesterday, the NCAA settled a head-injury lawsuit by creating a $70 million fund. The money will diagnose current athletes and those who’ve already left college to determine whether they’ve suffered head injuries. Sound familiar? The NFL’s been trying to reach a settlement for players too. But this NCAA settlement isn’t exactly like the one proposed in the NFL lawsuit, since it won’t pay players directly who have suffered brain trauma. Individual players can sue their school if they want to get paid damages. A lot of people think the settlement still doesn’t do enough.

The man who couldn’t shoot straight, either with a weapon or about weapons, has been shooting his mouth off about the war in Iraq. There was Dick Cheney in the news, so perfectly Ponderosa in his cowboy hat, so faux fatherly with his daughter by his side -- just seeing his smug mug again makes my blood boil. Even more infuriating is the arrogance of his accusations. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, the instigator-in-chief of the murderous Middle East muddle says it’s time for President Obama to face the hard facts about Iraq. Facts? Where were the facts when then Vice-President Cheney said this?. “There is no doubt that Saddam now has WMD. There is no doubt that he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us.” Or this? ""I think (the war) will go relatively quickly. Weeks rather than months."" Or this? ""My belief is we will, in fact, be greeted as liberators."" Cheney may be trying to rewrite history while his heart is still in it, to re-invent himself as a wise elder statesman. If so, he’s gone way off the ranch. Americans may not agree with every step Obama takes to end what Cheney started, but as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pointed out to him, “Unfortunately, we already tried it your way. And it was the biggest foreign policy blunder in the history of our country.” Hyperbole? Maybe. But to twist a line from Cheney’s own poison pen: “Rarely has there been a Vice-President so wrong about so much at the expense of so many."" Cheney calls Obama “willfully blind to the impact of his policies.” Yet he refuses to open his own eyes and own up to the destruction his war has wrought. The $200-million dollar cost projected by the Cheney crowd has ballooned into the trillions. Some 4,500 Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis have lost their lives. More than 30-thousand troops have been wounded in Iraq. Tens of thousands more suffer from Traumatic Brain Injury and PTSD. Take those hard facts, Dick. Cheney says Mr.Obama seems determined “to leave office ensuring he has taken America down a notch. Indeed the speed of the terrorists’ takeover of territory in Iraq has been matched only by the speed of American decline on his watch.” Yet during Cheney’s eight year reign, America’s favorability ratings around the world dropped precipitously, according to the Pew Research Center, as much as 20 points in some countries (regaining much ground since Obama took office)... never mind how we were left feeling about ourselves. And if the President is living in a fantasy world, as Cheney suggests here: ""Too many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is 'ending' the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- as though wishing made it so,” then two words spring to mind from 2003: Read his lips. “Mission accomplished.” What America needs now from Dick Cheney is not advice, or excuses, or admonishments but simply...I’m sorry. (And isn’t it shameful that we haven’t heard that yet?) I’m sorry, my fellow Americans, for deceiving you into an unnecessary, futile and financially onerous war. I’m sorry, America, for ruining your good name across the globe and squandering the good will we felt after 9-11. I’m sorry to the people of Iraq who lost so much more than a brutal dictator. I’m deeply sorry to the thousands of beautiful young soldiers who died because of my power-tripping politics. And I beg the forgiveness of mothers and fathers, wives and children who are left to grieve every day because of me. If he can’t bring himself to say those words, then he should have the grace not to say anything at all.",Private

Ray Rice was just released from the Baltimore Ravens for reasons you already know. Brown thinks it might be a good time to talk about the problem of domestic violence. Skimm This ALL ABOUT THAT SYRIA THE STORY You may have heard the Mideast has a problem. It’s called ISIS. Earlier this week, President Obama raised his hand and said he has a plan to take the group down. THE WHAT To do this, Obama is ready to act not just in Iraq, but Syria too. Think: airstrikes, and arming and training rebel groups already on the ground trying to oust Syrian President Assad. This is all raising a lot of eyebrows – years of civil war and infighting between opposition groups has made Syria one big international wild card. WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK? Congress…House Republicans are in. Some Dems aren’t so sure. Yes, it’s an election year. The UK & Europe…Behind Obama 100%. In spirit. Just about everybody’s offering to pony up the cash for logistics and humanitarian aid. But airstrikes? In Syria? Please hold. The Mideast…Some of the countries have already been dealing with ISIS on their own for a while. But Obama says US troops can’t “take the place of Arab partners in securing their region.” Hint: anyone want to get in on the airstrikes? Anyone? Bueller…Bueller? Russia…Nyet. Nyet. You’re violating international law and we’re mad at you about everything else, anyway. Syria…Well, hello there…The government of President Assad (the man Obama says ‘must go’) thinks it’s great if the US crushes ISIS but only if the US coordinates with the Assad administration. Rock meet hard place. Meanwhile, the rebels – the ones Obama hopes to support – think airstrikes could do a lot more harm than good. theSKIMM Over 190,000 people have died in Syria since its civil war began. There are a lot of reasons the international community has spent the better part of over three years trying to stay out of it. And while everybody has a stake in seeing ISIS go down, nobody seem to want to touch Syria with a 10-foot pole. Skimm This REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WATCHING… The Oscar Pistorius trial. Today, the judge said that Pistorius is guilty of culpable homicide, after freeing him from the more serious charge of premeditated murder. Refresher: last year, Pistorius — the same double-amputee you rooted for in the London 2012 Olympics — shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp through a bathroom door. The prosecution said he killed her on purpose, while the defense said ‘hold up, it was a mistake and he thought she was an intruder.’ The judge said there wasn’t enough evidence to prove Pistorius meant to kill Steenkamp, so he’s free from the life sentence that comes with the “premeditated murder” package. Culpable homicide means he was negligent and now faces a sentence that could range from no time behind bars to up to 15 years in prison. WHAT TO SAY ON A FIRST DATE THIS WEEKEND… Nothing about abortion laws. This week, Missouri lawmakers made it clear that women seeking abortions will have to wait 72 hours before undergoing the procedure, even if their pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. Missouri’s governor vetoed the bill, but state lawmakers overrode his decision. People who aren’t so into abortion think the extra time lets women fully consider their decision and options. Abortion rights advocates think the waiting period makes the process even harder for women and insults their decision-making capabilities. Utah and South Dakota are the only other states with 72-hour waiting periods, though Utah allows exceptions for rape and incest. WHAT TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEY’RE TIRED AT WORK… What a shocking revelation. In a surprising new move, the EU and the US are slapping Russia with…drumroll…more sanctions…since Russia ‘can’t stop, won’t stop’ meddling in Ukraine. New sanctions come a week after a truce was reached between Ukraine and the pro-Russian separatists who’ve been fighting for months. But 1,000 armed Russian troops are still in eastern Ukraine. Where are the sanctions hitting Russia this time? The money-maker. Literally. The EU’s sanctions will block loans from five big state banks and target oil and defense firms, and the US plans on stopping Russia’s largest bank and others from accessing US capital. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU JUST WANT SOME ALONE TIME… Scotland feels you. The country’s voting next week on whether or not to break free from the UK. Some Scots want to be independent because they think they have the resources and economic power to fly solo. Scotland’s move towards independence started in 2011, when the nationalist party (once considered fringe) came into power and started pushing for a referendum vote. Last week, for the first time, polls showed that people are leaning towards independence, though support’s slipped since then. Yesterday, two big banks, Lloyds and RBS, said they’ll move to England if Scotland decides to go it alone. The IMF also warned that if Scotland votes for independence, markets could have a freak-out. Voting happens on Thursday. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU SEE A RADIOSHACK… So that’s still a thing. Maybe not for long, though. RadioShack‘s on the edge of bankruptcy, because when was the last time you hit up a RadioShack? Yesterday, it said it will have to close up shop unless it takes some serious measures. Think: restructuring debt, closing more stores, and ‘shuffling’ management. RadioShack hasn’t been quick on the technology uptake, and its image is stuck in the ’80s. Paging for help…with an actual pager. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHILE WATCHING “SVU”… Too real. In a scene straight out of “Prison Break,” three prisoners escaped last night from an Ohio prison. Two of them have been returned to custody, including T.J. Lane — the infamous shooter serving three life sentences for killing three students at an Ohio high school in 2012. He was on the run until this morning, and the escape led police on a massive manhunt. One of the inmates is sill on the loose.

SHARE THIS SHARE THIS Skimm for November 21st Skimm’d while watching “Parenthood.” QUOTE OF THE DAY “I could iron now for days. I love to iron” — A grandmother after smoking weed for the first time. She inhaled. Skimm This STAY FOR AWHILE THE STORY Last night, President Obama triple-dog-dared Congress to pass an immigration bill. Until it does, he’s going to do what he wants – and that’s letting undocumented immigrants “come out of the shadows” without the fear of being deported. WAIT, WHAT? There are more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US. It’s a security issue, an economic issue, and a messaging issue for the land of the free. Congress has been flapping its arms for years, trying to figure out a solution that works for both sides of the aisle. Last year, the Senate passed a bipartisan immigration bill…but the House leadership never let it come to a vote. Then over the summer, things got even more heated when a record number of undocumented minors crossed the US-Mexico border. SO WHAT IS OBAMA DOING? Using executive action — DC-speak for going it alone. The main point of the president’s plan is to give millions of undocumented immigrants a chance to temporarily stay in the US without the fear of deportation. That invite is open to parents of US citizens and people who’ve been living here for at least five years — if they pass background checks and are willing to pay taxes. Who’s not safe? People with criminal records and people planning on illegally crossing the US border anytime soon. TELL ME MORE… Obama says this is NOT amnesty: nobody’s getting citizenship or the right to stay here permanently. Obama’s also going to bulk up border patrol and speed up the deportation process. And it’s going to be easier for highly skilled workers to stay. WHAT DOES THE GOP THINK? Is he President or King Obama? This is a big, BIG abuse of power. Expect a major fight ahead when Republicans take control of Congress in January. But first, we need a strategy that doesn’t alienate Hispanic voters. theSKIMM After saying that taking executive action on immigration would be “violating our laws,” President Obama, with only a few years left on the job, decided to do it anyway. Republicans are loudly reminding him that this kind of thing is not cool, and that voters just handed them control of Congress in the midterms. Bottom line: this isn’t over. THE *: Didn’t get enough? We made you an immigration guide. Skimm This REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEY MET A MRS. ROBINSON… There’s nothing like the original. Mike Nichols – the iconic director of movies like “The Graduate” – died of a heart attack at age 83. He was one of 12 people to attain EGOT status, meaning he won at least one Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony in his lifetime. Nichols was known for pulling great performances out of legendary actors, like Meryl Streep in “Heartburn,” Elizabeth Taylor in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and Dustin Hoffman in “The Graduate.” As for the stage, Nichols directed countless plays, including “The Odd Couple” and “Spamalot,” and his theater work earned him nine Tonys. He was married to ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer for 26 years. Nichols is survived by Sawyer, his three children, and four grandchildren. WHAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT… Rolling Stone’s recent article about rape allegations at the University of Virginia and the school’s “culture of sexual assault.” In the article, Jackie, a student, alleges that seven men at a frat party raped her in September 2012. She didn’t come forward until months after the incident, after faculty and other students allegedly discouraged her from doing so. Yesterday, UVA’s president said the article includes details that university officials didn’t know about before, and she’s asked local police to investigate the rape allegations. The fraternity in question voluntarily suspended all operations as well yesterday. UVA is one of a handful of schools under a special investigation by the US government for improperly handling sexual-violence complaints. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU SEE A “HUNGER GAMES” MOVIE POSTER… The odds are you’re not in Thailand. Yesterday, a Thai movie chain pulled the new “Hunger Games” movie from its lineup. Protestors in Thailand have been using the three-finger salute from the film as a symbol of resistance. In May, the military took over in a coup, alleging the government was corrupt. Protestors against the coup started flashing the “Hunger Games” symbol. The military apparently isn’t Team Katniss and threatened to arrest anyone who used the symbol. Not an idle threat — at least five protesters have recently been arrested and detained for hours. They were all told they could still be charged for violating martial law. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR DAD OFFERS TO PAY FOR YOUR CAB… Maybe keep it. Yesterday, California officials approved tuition hikes for the state’s public university system. Tuition at UC campuses is set to go up again – by as much as 28% over the next five years, unless the state pitches in. So if you want a side of California sunshine with your college degree, it looks like in-state tuition fees are going to be $612 more next fall. Gov. Jerry Brown (D) thinks it’s time California schools learn to cut costs and be more frugal. And in the meantime, CA students and families should brace themselves for a potentially bigger bill. Skimm This THING TO KNOW No contest: Used when a defendant doesn’t want to plead guilty. It’s seen as an admission of guilt with a ‘have mercy’ undertone. Adrian Peterson used this plea.

"THE WEEKLY TIP: BREAKING: Palestinians Fire at Least 60 Rockets At Southern Israel https://www.kintera.com/accounttempfiles/account16894/images/tip-logo-horizontal_sm.jpg Follow Us on: Twitter Facebook YouTube THE WEEKLY TIP http://www.thetower.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/gaza-rocket-monument.jpg BREAKING: Palestinians Fire at Least 60 Rockets At Southern Israel March 12, 2014 Palestinians in the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip launched at least 60 rockets at Israeli population centers around 5 p.m. local time Wednesday, triggering sirens across the country’s Gaza envelop and deepening worries that Palestinian terror groups may be positioning themselves to start another round of fighting with the Jewish state. Early reports had the attacks claimed by Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), one of several groups that observers worry have been stockpiling weapons, including advanced missiles. PIJ, Hamas, and other Gazan terror organizations have been locked in cycles of cooperation and competition for domestic and regional popularity. A PIJ team yesterday managed to fire a mortar at Israel. An Israeli airstrike targeted the fighters, killing three. A top Hamas official publicly boasted this week that the Iran-backed terror group intends to blanket Israel with missiles and rockets during any future conflagration. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon had warned as far back as last fall that Hamas was arming itself in anticipation of “a renewal of violence,” an assessment that came amid increasingly specific intelligence indicating that the organization was looking to provoke a conflict with Israel in order to reverse what had become a precipitous decline in its domestic and international positions.

Ban highlighted the fact that Mehdi Karoubi and Mirhossein Mousavi, presidential candidates in 2009, have been under house arrest since 2011, despite never being charged with a crime.

Obama will soon go to meet Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah in Riyadh at a time when bilateral relations are very tense because of nuclear talks with Iran that could lead to improved relations between Tehran and the West. They also differ on the Syrian crisis especially after Washington refused to use force despite reports of the Syrian regime iusing chemical weapons against its opponents. But the real cleft between the two began earlier because of their opposing positions on the January 25 Revolution and this has not been addressed until today. Accordingly, Egypt will be high on the agenda of summit talks between Obama and King Abdullah.

This time around the UAE is angry that the State Department’s human rights report makes it appear that the founder of the Ummah Party, Hassan al-Diqqi, is just a regular democratic organizer…The Washington Post reported last year that al-Diqqi had appeared in a YouTube video as the leader of a jihadist militia in Syria appealing for donations.

"Remarks of Amb. Martin Indyk at Washington Institute - May 8, 2014 Remarks Ambassador Martin Indyk Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations The Washington Institute's Weinberg Conference Washington, DC May 8, 2014 _____ …. Last July, President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry launched a vigorous effort to reach a final status agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Now it is early May, we have passed the nine-month marker for these negotiations, and for the time being the talks have been suspended. Some have said this process is over. But that is not correct. Asm y little story testifies. As you all know well— in the Middle East, it’s never over. Think back to the spring of 1975, the year the United States brokered the Sinai II agreement. In March of that year, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger set out to the region to broker a second disengagement agreement between Israel and Egypt. After ten days of shuttling back and forth between the parties, the Secretary of State suspended his efforts and returned to Washington empty handed. The President, President Ford, and the Secretary announced they would step back. Kissinger vented his frustration. Maybe a David Ben-Gurion or a Golda Meir could lead Israel to a peace agreement, he fumed, but never a Yitzhak Rabin! We learned a little later what a peacemaker Yitzhak Rabin could be. Everybody thought it was over. Of course, as we know now, everybody was wrong. A few months later the talks were restarted, and soon thereafter a deal was reached. What was true then is possibly true today: this process is always difficult, but it is never impossible. But in certain ways, things were more difficult in the Kissinger days and in some ways, they were easier. For an audience that loves Middle East history, I think it is interesting to take stock of what has changed and what has stayed the same since Henry’s time. In some ways things are easier in the Israeli-Palestinian context today than in the past. The international context for peacemaking is better today. The Cold War and fear that a conflict in the Middle East would trigger a nuclear superpower confrontation is no longer there. The region has not faced an all-out Arab-Israeli war in 40 years. Peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan have held today despite very difficult circumstances—two intifadas, conflicts with Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, and of course the Arab Revolutions. Turmoil in the Mideast is bringing Israelis and Arab states closer together. Indeed, there is a virtual realignment taking place between the enemies of moderation on the one side and the proponents of moderation on the other that crossed the Arab Israeli divide. As Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has noted, “many Arab leaders today already realize that Israel is not their enemy, that peace with the Palestinians would turn our relations with them and with many Arab countries into open and thriving relationships.” In the Israeli-Palestinian domestic arena there is, in some ways, greater political realism than before. Back in Kissinger’s day, Golda Meir said there was no such thing as a Palestinian people. Now a Likud prime minister says there has to be two states for two people. Back then, Yasser Arafat was committed to Israel’s destruction. Today, his successor, Abu Mazen, is committed to living alongside Israel in peace. The U.S.-Israel relationship has also changed in quite dramatic ways. Only those who know it from the inside – as I have had the privilege to do – can testify to how deep and strong are the ties that now bind our two nations. When President Obama speaks with justifiable pride about those bonds as “unbreakable” he means what he says. And he knows of what he speaks. Unlike the “reassessment” Kissinger did in the Ford Administration, there is one significant difference: President Obama and Secretary Kerry would never suspend U.S.-Israel military relations as their predecessors did back then. Those military relations are too important to both our nations. However, in many respects, when it comes to peace negotiations, things have proven to be much harder today than in the 1970s. Kissinger faced Israelis and Egyptians who were coming off the painful 1973 war. I was an Australian student in Israel at the time. I remember well the sense of existential dread in the country brought on by the scope of Israeli casualties, and I remember also a willingness to consider withdrawals from Sinai that had previously been ruled out. Few of you remember Moshe Dayan stated before the 1973 war that he would rather have Sharm el Sheikh than peace. Egypt also had a sense of urgency, generated by Sadat’s belief that only peace with Israel could change Egypt’s dire circumstances and only U.S. diplomacy could achieve that peace. Yet, where is this sense of urgency today? To be absolutely clear, I am not for a moment suggesting that violence is necessary to produce urgency and flexibility. That is abhorrent. We are very fortunate to have two leaders, in President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu, who are committed to achieving a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through peaceful means. But one problem that revealed itself in these past nine months is that the parties, although both showing flexibility in the negotiations, do not feel the pressing need to make the gut-wrenching compromises necessary to achieve peace. It is easier for the Palestinians to sign conventions and appeal to international bodies in their supposed pursuit of “justice” and their “rights,” a process which by definition requires no compromise. It is easier for Israeli politicians to avoid tension in the governing coalition and for the Israeli people to maintain the current comfortable status quo. It is safe to say that if we the US are the only party that has a sense of urgency, these negotiations will not succeed. Kissinger also had the advantage of being able to pursue peace incrementally – what he labeled the “step-by-step” approach. He told me recently that he introduced that idea because, after the trauma of the Yom Kippur War, he believed Israeli society could not handle the big jump to a total withdrawal from Sinai. It took six years from war to peace on the Israeli-Egyptian front. On the Israeli-Palestinian front, the Oslo Accords provided for an interim process that was supposed to last five years. It has now been twenty years since Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat shook hands on the White House south lawn. Since then, thousands of Israelis and Palestinians have died and the interim process is now thoroughly stuck, with further redeployments and road maps turned into road kill along the way. An interim period that was designed to build trust has in fact exacerbated mistrust: suicide bombings, the second intifada, and continuous settlement growth have led many people on both sides to lose faith. This is why Secretary Kerry, with the full backing of President Obama, decided to try this time around for a conflict-ending agreement. There are other differences too. Egypt is a state with a five thousand year history, capable of living up to its commitments. The Palestinians are just now in the process of building their state and given the bitter experience of the second intifada and the consequences of the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, Israelis don’t trust them to live up to any of their commitments. Even now, after a serious U.S.-led endeavor to build credible Palestinian security services, after seven years of security cooperation that the IDF and the Shin Bet now highly appreciate, and Abu Mazen’s efforts to promote non-violence in the face of pressure from extremists, the fundamental mistrust remains. The geographic context is different too. The Sinai Peninsula is a 200 kilometer buffer zone between Israel and Egypt. Israelis and Palestinians live virtually on top of each other. Moreover, the geographic issues are at the heart of what it means to be a Palestinian or an Israeli. The core issues – land, refugees, Jerusalem – have defined both peoples for a very long time. It is part of their identity in a way that the Sinai desert was not. Now, as back in 1975, we face a breakdown in talks, with both sides trying to put the blame on the other party. The fact is both the Israelis and Palestinians missed opportunities, and took steps that undermined the process. We have spoken publicly about unhelpful Israeli steps that combined to undermine the negotiations. But it is important to be clear: We view steps the Palestinians took during the negotiations as unhelpful too. Signing accession letters to fifteen international treaties at the very moment when we were attempting to secure the release of the fourth tranche of prisoners was particularly counterproductive. And the final step that led to the suspension of the negotiations at the end of April was the announcement of a Fatah-Hamas reconciliation agreement while we were working intensively on an effort to extend the negotiations. But it is much more important to focus on where we go from here. And it is critical that both sides now refrain from taking any steps that could lead to an escalation and dangerous spiral that could easily get out of control. Thus far since the negotiations been suspended they have both shown restraint and it is essential that this continue. We have also spoken about the impact of settlement activity. Just during the past nine months of negotiations, tenders for building 4,800 units were announced and planning was advanced for another 8,000 units. It’s true that most of the tendered units are slated to be built in areas that even Palestinian maps in the past have indicated would be part of Israel. Yet the planning units were largely outside that area in the West Bank. And from the Palestinian experience, there is no distinction between planning and building. Indeed, according to the Israeli Bureau of Census and Statistics, from 2012 to 2013 construction starts in West Bank settlements more than doubled. That’s why Secretary Kerry believes it is essential to delineate the borders and establish the security arrangements in parallel with all the other permanent status issues. In that way, once a border is agreed each party would be free to build in its own state. I also worry about a more subtle threat to the character of the Jewish state. Prime Minister Netanyahu himself has made clear, the fundamental purpose of these negotiations is to ensure that Israel remains a Jewish and democratic state − not a de facto bi-national state. The settlement movement on the other hand may well drive Israel into an irreversible binational reality. If you care about Israel’s future, as I know so many of you do and as I do, you should understand that rampant settlement activity – especially in the midst of negotiations – doesn’t just undermine Palestinian trust in the purpose of the negotiations; it can undermine Israel’s Jewish future. If this continues, it could mortally wound the idea of Israel as a Jewish state – and that would be a tragedy of historic proportions. Public opinion was another element that we found very challenging over the past 9 months. Kissinger focused very little on this element, because while the Israelis and Egyptians fought wars with each other, their societies were not physically intertwined. The peace between two states mediated by Dr. Kissinger was not psychologically difficult. Israelis and Palestinians by contrast are both physically intertwined and psychologically separated and terrorism and occupation have added to the trauma between the peoples, making everything harder. Consistently over the last decade polling on both sides reveals majority support for the two state solution. But as many of you know neither side believes the other side wants it and neither seems to understand the concerns of the other. For example, Palestinians don’t comprehend the negative impact of their incitement on the attitudes of Israelis. When Palestinians who murdered Israeli women and children are greeted as “heroes” in celebration of their release, who can blame the Israeli public – parents who lost children, and children who lost parents – for feeling despair. On the other side, Palestinians feel that Israelis don’t even see their suffering any more, thanks to the success of the security barrier and the security cooperation. One Palestinian negotiator told his Israeli counterparts in one of our sessions: “You just don’t see us; we are like ghosts to you.” Israelis don’t seem to appreciate the highly negative impact on the Palestinian public of the IDF’s demolition of Palestinian homes, or military operations in populated Palestinians towns that are supposed to be the sole security responsibility of the Palestinian Authority, or the perceived double standard applied to settlers involved in “price tag” attacks. Palestinians cannot imagine how offended and suspicious Israelis become when they call Jews only a religion and not a people. Israelis cannot understand why it took a Palestinian leader 65 years to acknowledge the enormity of the Holocaust; Palestinians cannot understand why their leader should have been denigrated rather than applauded for now doing so. And the list goes on and on. The upshot of these competing narratives, grievances and insensitivities is that they badly affected the environment for negotiations. While serious efforts were under way behind closed doors, we tried to get the leaders and their spokesmen to engage in synchronized positive messaging to their publics. Instead, Prime Minister Netanyahu was understandably infuriated by the outrageous claims of Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief negotiator no less, that the Prime Minister was plotting the assassination of the Palestinian president. And Abu Mazen was humiliated by false Israeli claims that he had agreed to increased settlement activity in return for the release of prisoners. So, why then in the face of all of this, do I believe that direct negotiations can still deliver peace? Because over the last nine months, behind the closed doors of the negotiating rooms, I've witnessed Israelis and Palestinians engaging in serious and intensive negotiations. I’ve seen Prime Minister Netanyahu straining against his deeply-held beliefs to find ways to meet Palestinian requirements. I’ve seen Abu Mazen ready to put his state’s security in American hands to overcome Israeli distrust of Palestinian intentions. I have seen moments where both sides have been unwilling to walk in each other’s shoes. But I have also witnessed moments of recognition by both sides of what is necessary. I have seen moments when both sides talked past each other without being able to recognize it. But I have also seen moments of genuine camaraderie and engagement in the negotiating room to find a settlement to these vexing challenges. The reality is that aside from Camp David and Annapolis, serious permanent status talks have been a rarity since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. For all of its flaws, this makes the past nine months important. In twenty rounds over the first six months, we managed to define clearly the gaps that separate the parties on all the core issues. And since then we have conducted intensive negotiations with the leaders and their teams to try to bridge those gaps. Under the leadership of General Allen, we have done unprecedented work to determine how best to meet Israel’s security requirements in the context of a two state solution -- which Secretary Kerry has emphasized from Day One is absolutely essential to any meaningful resolution to this conflict. As a result we are all now better informed about what it will take to achieve a permanent status agreement. One thing that will never change and is as true today as it was during Kissinger’s time is that peace is always worth pursuing, no matter how difficult the path. Indeed, until the very last minute it may seem impossible, as it did in Kissinger’s day. The cynics and critics will sit on the sidelines and jeer. They will say I told you so. They are doing it already. They will even claim that the United States is disengaging from the world, even as we have been deeply engaged in this issue that matters so much to so many of our partners around the globe. But we will make no apologies for pursuing the goal of peace. Secretary Kerry certainly won’t. And President Obama won’t. To quote Secretary Kerry “the United States has a responsibility to lead, not to find the pessimism and negativity that’s so easily prevalent in the world today.” And the benefits are just too important to let go. For Palestinians: A sovereign state of their own. A dignified future. A just solution for the refugees. For Israelis: A more secure Jewish and democratic homeland. An opportunity to tap into the potential for a strategic alliance and deep economic relations with its Arab neighbors. For all of us. For all of the children of Abraham. An opportunity for a more prosperous, peaceful, and secure future. Whether we get there or not, however, ultimately comes down to leadership. After a five months pause, Kissinger was able to resume the negotiations with Rabin and Sadat and bring them to a successful Sinai II Disengagement Agreement because Rabin was eventually capable of overcoming his political constraints and Sadat was prepared to make positive gestures that made it possible for Rabin to do so. As Dr. Kissinger has noted, “The task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been before.” Let’s hope it won’t take a five month pause this time. Let’s hope that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu are able to overcome the hurdles that now lie on that path back to the negotiating table. When they are ready, they will certainly find in Secretary Kerry and President Obama willing partners in the effort to try again – if they are prepared to do so in a serious way. The obvious truth is that neither Israelis nor Palestinians are going away. They must find a way to live together in peace, respecting each other, side-by-side, in two independent states. There is no other solution. The United States stands ready to assist in this task, to help the leaders take their peoples to where they have never been, but where they still dream of going.

But hours after the truce officially began, fighting continued in Gaza, and Hamas fired rockets into Israel. The cease-fire is supposed to bring humanitarian aid to the area, and last for three days unless extended. Forces on the ground will remain in place. This comes right after Israel called up 16,000 more reservists and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would complete its mission to destroy underground tunnels connecting Gaza to Israel “with or without a cease-fire.” Also yesterday, President Obama’s office said that an Israeli shelling on a UN school earlier this week was “totally unacceptable.” Which was the US’s most straightforward scolding of its Israeli friends yet.

The Royals might not be able to have their annual ball at their Scottish estate. Bugger. theSKIMM Is this a case of two countries, one kilt? TBD. Skimm This CONGRESS THE STORY Yesterday, the House voted to back President Obama’s plan to help Syrian rebels fighting against ISIS. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? Obama’s one step closer to getting a permission slip from Congress to train and arm some rebels in Syria that have been fighting both Syria’s president and ISIS. ANYTHING ELSE? Remember that time Obama said ‘no ground troops’ would go to Iraq while the US fights ISIS? And that time he repeated it? Well, earlier this week, his top military adviser told Congress he wouldn’t rule out recommending that Obama send ground troops. So yesterday, Mr. President had to add ‘damage control’ to his itinerary. theSKIMM The words ‘ground troops’ and ‘Iraq’ in the same sentence hit a nerve for Americans. Having a key military adviser say them just before Congress started voting? Not what Obama was hoping for. The Senate could vote as soon as today on his plan. REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU CAN’T STOP HEARING THE SAME SONG… If I hear “Fancy” one more time I’m gonna lose it. That’s how everyone feels about the NFL. Last night, Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer was arrested for domestic violence and deactivated from all team activities. This comes after a week of multiple headlines featuring NFL players and abuse. And PR issues aren’t just a pro problem. Yesterday, Florida State benched Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston for half a game for standing on a table and yelling “f**k her right in the p**sy.” Nice to see that chivalry’s not dead. The saying is an Internet meme that Winston decided to make his own. This is the same Winston who was accused of rape by a student two years ago. He also forgot to pay for some crab legs from a supermarket this year…because YOLO? Winston said he knows he has to “tone it down.” Sounds about right. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN THE NEWS SEEMS TOO DEPRESSING… Maybe don’t read this one. A measles vaccine that went bad has killed at least 15 and as many as 50 kids in northwestern Syria. The area where the vaccine was administered is controlled by rebel forces fighting against President Bashar al-Assad. They hoped to serve as a temporary government in the area and help provide basic health care to citizens. So this is a setback. Some of the victims were just infants. It’s unclear whether the vaccine went bad at a storage facility or was tampered with. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU REALIZE THE SHADOW IS JUST A COAT RACK… Seeing things. Earlier this month, a lot of people in the Rockies saw a “fireball” exploding in the sky. People thought, ‘It’s a meteor…it’s a UFO…’ but spoiler: it’s a Russian. Turns out the great balls of fire were really part of a Russian spy satellite that broke away from the mothership. Is that just a draft or are we living a la Cold War? Apparently these spy satellites still like to keep tabs on the US military’s equipment and toys. The US military’s always known this but for a lot of people this is news. The Russian Defense Ministry said they question the “condition” the “so-called” US experts were in when they decided it was a Russian satellite that went down. Zing. Skimm This THING TO KNOW Just the (Fantasy) tip: Falcons QB Matt Ryan had a rough time against the Bengals last week. But expect “Matty Ice” to bounce back tonight against the Buccaneers, who’ve had a harghhh-de-hard (sorry, pirate joke) run so far this season. SKIMM GIFT You know what’s supposed to be relaxing?

"Daily Skimm: Oh yes, it's time Is this email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser. SHARE THIS SHARE THIS Skimm the Vote design by Skimm'bassador Miranda Setliff Skimm for November 4th Skimm’d while picking out something to go with an “I Voted” sticker. QUOTE OF THE DAY “It’s a beautiful building, it’s a historic building, but it’s an office building and it’s open for business” – A developer for 1 World Trade Center. Thirteen years after 9/11, the building is open for business. Skimm This PICK ME, CHOOSE ME, LOVE ME THE STORY It’s that time again…elections. Not the big one, but the midterms. Still important. Pay attention. NOT GETTING A PRESIDENT THIS YEAR, DON’T CARE. Good for you. But you still need to vote. Midterm elections are when we choose governors, congressmen/women, senators, state reps and more. WHY IS THIS YEAR SO IMPORTANT? Everyone can agree on one thing: no one’s happy. Both parties blame the other. And voters blame Congress. On a national level, this means you should brace yourself for a government shakeup, especially in the Senate, where Dems are currently in power. If that changes, expect President Obama to be in a bad mood, because it would mean the GOP would control both houses of Congress, and he’ll be seeing a lot more of this smile. On a local level, expect people to try to create change closer to home. WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW? There is no defining issue driving the nation to the polls, but a laundry list of things on voters’ minds. LIKE WHAT? The Economy…as in the numbers have gone from worse to less-worse, but the economy still isn’t great. And it’s the issue where neither party is safe. Immigration…as in an issue that fires up the Democratic base and gets them to the polls. In the last presidential election, more than 70% of Hispanics voted for Obama. But earlier this year, Obama tabled immigration reform to protect Democratic candidates in tough Red state races. So no, Hispanics aren’t as loco for the Dems this time around. The Ladies…as in issues about women, for women, that will be decided in part by men running for office (we’re talking equal pay, birth control, abortion). Dems are hoping their positions will be the X (chromosome) factor they need to keep their hold on the Senate. Foreign Policy… as in name your issue. Things like Ebola, the Mideast, and ISIS have been in the spotlight, and a lot of people aren’t pleased with how Obama’s handled them. President Obama…as in his name isn’t on any of the ballots, but it might as well be. Some number crunchers are thinking this could be the worst midterm loss for a second-term president in decades. I’M STILL NOT EXCITED. Thanks. And don’t worry, you’re apparently not alone. WHAT STATES SHOULD I REALLY BE WATCHING? Everyone should vote. But if you live in these states, DEFINITELY make sure you vote. Wisconsin, Kentucky, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Iowa, Mississippi, Florida, Texas, Arizona P.S. You should expect a few races to be too close to call. We share your excitement. WHAT ARE THE DEMS SAYING? Don’t. Panic. Please? We’re hanging onto the Senate for dear life. Mad that things haven’t been getting done? Blame it on the GOP taking the House in ’10. Imagine if they get the Senate too. Word to the wise: don’t be distracted by their good looks. WHAT’S THE GOP SAYING? Alright, alright, alright. After six years of back-seat driving, we’re ready to take the wheel. This is our chance to set the nation’s political agenda and actually get things voted through. But please, no fans. HOW MUCH DOES THIS ALL COST? More than these boats. These are the most expensive midterm elections ever. theSKIMM This election’s like “Seinfeld” – it’s about nothing and everything. The midterms are a dress rehearsal for soon-to-be presidential candidates. They’re all over the country campaigning for members of their party. Christie? Bush (the Jeb one)? Clinton? Gang’s all here. Pay attention. And vote. Skimm This REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU GET DUMPED WITH A POST-IT NOTE… Shake it off? Yesterday, Spotify was in post break-up mode after Taylor Swift pulled her music from the streaming service with little warning. This comes a week after her new album release, which is about to hit over 1 million copies sold. Before yesterday, the album, “1989″, was not fully available on Spotify, but anyone could listen to more old-school Swift on the streaming service. No more. Tay has never really been down with streaming services, writing in the WSJ earlier this year that they are part of the reason paid album sales have shrunk “drastically.” Now, Spotify is eating ice cream by the pint and trying to woo Swift back by making her mix tapes. Literally. This could also be a strategic decision made by her label, Big Machine, which is reportedly in the process of selling itself. Note to Tay’s new ex, Spotify: expect a song written about you soon. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU OVERHEAR SOMETHING HOMOPHOBIC… Nyet. A memorial to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was taken down in Russia, one day after Apple CEO Tim Cook came out publicly. Not a coincidence. The memorial, which was in the shape of an iPhone and located outside a college in St. Petersburg, was put up last year by a group of companies called ZEFS. The group said it took down the memorial because it didn’t gel with a Russian law prohibiting “gay propaganda and other sexual perversions among minors.” This law was signed by President Putin last year and it’s meant to promote “family values.” It also promotes a lot of hand-to-forehead motions from pretty much everyone else. Meanwhile, Russians should get ready for a shipment of extra-bendy iPhones. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR NEW FITNESS APP ASKS HOW MUCH YOU WEIGH… Is it OK to round down here? Yesterday, Hyundai and Kia agreed to pay the US govt. a penalty worth more than $300 million for overstating miles-per-gallon claims for some of their popular models. It’s the harshest penalty the US has ever handed down for this kind of thing. Two years ago, Hyundai and Kia admitted they’d misreported by up to six miles-per-gallon on some cars and SUVs. And they’ve already paid for it – last year, the companies settled with annoyed drivers for about $400 million. Psst, they aren’t the only cars in the lot with some inaccurate numbers. Lots of other auto makers including Ford have admitted to overstating their cars’ fuel economy. But US officials won’t say whether they’ll face penalties too – just that Hyundai and Kia are the most “egregious” case. Tanks for nothing. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR FRIEND TELLS YOU THERE’S A 30% CHANCE IT’S ALREADY RAINING… In other breaking news, FIFA recently consulted a calendar and realized a summer World Cup in the Middle East probably wasn’t the best-case scenario. Qatar, which is supposed to host the 2022 Cup, can reach a brisk 120 degrees on any given summer day. So now FIFA is thinking winter could be more “ideal” for the official kick-off. There are just a few minor hurdles to work out first. Some people are pointing out that the Winter Olympics are supposed to happen that year. Others are upset that it would disrupt the European soccer season. And literally everybody is wondering why this didn’t come up sooner. Skimm This THING TO KNOW PAC: A political action committee. Otherwise known as a group that donates money to campaigns, but has limits to how much it can chip in. Super PAC: A PAC on steroids that can raise as much cash-money as it desires to advocate for candidates or causes. It just can’t contribute directly to political campaigns or work with them. Dream: They both go out and give money to support candidates they believe in. Reality: Because there are no limits on funds for Super PACs, your average billionaire tends to really like these. But everyone still only gets one vote. One shot…one opportunity… So go vote today. SKIMM LIFE You need to vote. But first, you need to get there. Let Uber help you out with that.

"Daily Skimm: You know you want to Is this email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser. SHARE THIS SHARE THIS Skimm for October 15th QUOTE OF THE DAY “I’m really trying not to let this experience steal my joy but it’s hard” — An owner of an Hermes bag that apparently smells like a skunk. She’s not alone; a large batch of bags reportedly smell. Devastating. Skimm This THINGS WE’D LIKE TO STOP TALKING ABOUT EBOLA THE STORY Yesterday, the World Health Organization upped the Ebola ante by saying there could be 10,000 new cases per week by December. Merry F’ing Christmas. WHAT. The international community needs to figure out how to work together, because the WHO says 70% of people who get the virus are dying. And today, we found out that another Texas health worker tested positive for Ebola. There are a lot of concerns that the Texas hospital lacked protocol when a Liberian man was admitted with Ebola earlier this month and that US hospitals aren’t prepared to deal with the virus. So yesterday, the CDC said it will send a rapid-response team to any hospital in the US if there is a new case of Ebola. Meanwhile, everybody’s been pitching in to help — including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla, who announced yesterday that they’re donating $25 million to the CDC. theSKIMM Everybody would like Ebola to go away. The problem is, there’s no clear global plan to make that happen. THE MIDEAST THE STORY Yesterday, the US-led coalition stepped up airstrikes against ISIS in a key Syrian city on the border of Turkey. And Turkey did some striking of its own, but not on ISIS. EXPLAIN. For weeks, the Syrian city of Kobani has been in danger of falling to ISIS. If that happens, the Islamic militant group would have control of a huge part of the Turkey-Syria border. Not good. But Turkey won’t get in the fight, and everyone’s annoyed. WHY NOT? Because Kobani is controlled by Syrian Kurds – a semi-autonomous ethnic group that’s primarily in Iraq and Turkey. It’s believed that some Syrian Kurds may have ties to a Turkish group called the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which goes by the nickname PKK, and which Turkey and the US consider a terrorist group. Turkey and the PKK have had a long history of violence that finally ended two years ago. But yesterday, Turkey hit the PKK with airstrikes, claiming they had attacked military outposts. The PKK says nope, Turkey’s the one that broke the cease-fire. theSKIMM New group alert: PKK. Drop it next time someone asks why getting rid of ISIS isn’t just a one-size fits all effort. Skimm This REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY TO YOUR FRIENDS IN THE LONE STAR STATE… Did you hear about the Supreme Court decision? Yesterday, the Supremes let at least a dozen abortion clinics in Texas reopen. They blocked parts of a recent state law that caused all but eight abortion clinics in the state to close, which would have made some women travel more than 150 miles to the nearest clinic. The battle over this law inspired State Sen. Wendy Davis (D) to lace up her pink sneaks and filibuster for hours. She’s now running for governor against Greg Abbott (R), who is a supporter. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR CO-WORKERS HAVE A FIGHT… I’m yelling timber. Yesterday, pop star Kesha sued her longtime producer Dr. Luke for abuse. She’s asking the judge to take her out of her contract with him. In the lawsuit, Kesha claims she’s been sexually, physically, and verbally abused by Dr. Luke for 10 years, since she was 18-years-old. Kesha says that he made repeated sexual advances and encouraged her to do drugs. And since the “Your Love Is My Drug” lyrics weren’t supposed to be taken literally, Kesha wants out. Dr. Luke countersued and said said she’s made all this up to try to get out of her contract. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU HIT SEND ON AN EMAIL TOO EARLY… Wasn’t quite ready for that. Over the weekend, the Vatican said in a report that gay people had “gifts to offer” the church, which a lot of people interpreted as a shift in its stance on gays — to something more inclusive. Yesterday, the Vatican clarified the report is actually a “working document,” not the final word. Glad that’s settled. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHILE ORDERING BREAKFAST… I’ll take eggs, hard-boiled or frozen. Apple and Facebook have announced there will be enough frozen eggs to go around; they are going to cover egg-freezing for female employees. Many believe this is a way for them to attract and keep top talent and level the playing field — by making sure women know they don’t have to sacrifice baby-making for money-making. But critics are saying this is a very convenient way for companies to tell female employees ‘work is life, your eggs will wait!’ Facebook has already started the program and Apple is going to take it up early next year. An egg-freezing procedure costs around $10,000 and $500 a year to store the eggs – both companies will provide up to $20,000 under their health benefit programs. Skimm This SKIMM THE VOTE Midterm elections are next month. You should vote. So we made you a guide to make sure you know what’s up. AN ELECTION ISSUE: PRESIDENT OBAMA Obama’s name isn’t on any of the ballots in this election, but it might as well be. The last time a president had approval ratings near these levels was Dubya 43 in ’06, when Dems took the midterms by storm.

Turkey’s Anadolu Agency specifically quoted Hussein Youssef, whom the site described as a “leading Hamas figure,” declaring at one rally that “Palestinians will keep up street pressure to resist the occupation and stand by the prisoners.” Read More http://www.kintera.org/TR.asp?a=glLVJeNYLoJ1LaO3F&s=ktJXL5PNIoKVJ2NNJtF&m=muJ1KaOTKlLPLfL http://www.kintera.org/TR.asp?a=9oIHJTOwGhINJQNCH&s=ktJXL5PNIoKVJ2NNJtF&m=muJ1KaOTKlLPLfL Picture of the Week: Pope Francis and Israel's President Shimon Peres plant a ""Tree of Peace"" in the garden of Peres' official residence.

The White House will have two main options. One is react with fury and revive the threat of air strikes. “It is clear to me,” says James Jeffrey, a former Bush deputy national security advisor and Obama’s first ambassador to Iraq, “that the only position Obama can take is to say that the U.S. takes this seriously as a violation of our red line, and if that if chlorine gas is used again by regime forces, ‘I will use military force.’ Read More http://www.kintera.org/TR.asp?a=chKNK2MIIkLVL0PNG&s=ktJXL5PNIoKVJ2NNJtF&m=muJ1KaOTKlLPLfL http://www.kintera.org/TR.asp?a=fkLTLbNUKnK1JaO0E&s=ktJXL5PNIoKVJ2NNJtF&m=muJ1KaOTKlLPLfL TheTower.org Post Hezbollah Official: “Israel is the Main Enemy” May 25, 2014 http://www.thetower.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FeaturedImage_2014-05-23_WikiCommons_800px-Naim_Kassim.jpgThe Daily Star yesterday reported on a speech given by Hezbollah’s deputy leader, Sheikh Naim Qassem. “Isr",Private
"Pop Culture Update Oscar Shocker: 'Alone Yet Not Alone' Best Original Song Nomination Revoked In a rare move, ""Alone Yet Not Alone"" is ending its Oscar run on a low note. The Academy rescinded the best original song nomination for the film of the same name over accusations of improper campaigning. Its board of governors voted Tuesday night after revelations that the song's composer, Bruce Broughton, e-mailed members during the voting period. Broughton is a former member of the board. ""No matter how well-intentioned the communication, using one's position as a former governor and current executive committee member to personally promote one's own Oscar submission creates the appearance of an unfair advantage,"" said Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the Academy. Any perceived campaigning is considered a rule violation. http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/30/showbiz/oscar-nomination-rescinded/?hpt=zite_zite2_featured Address by Obama Drew Fewest Viewers Since 2000 More networks than ever before covered the State of the Union address Tuesday night, but the total audience still came in lower than any year since 2000. President Obama’s speech was seen by 33.3 million viewers, according to figures published by Nielsen. That was down just a touch from the 33.5 million who watched last year, but far off Mr. Obama’s initial “SOTU” in 2009, when he was seen by 52.3 million viewers. Nielsen has issued figures for every State of the Union speech going back to 1993, and the only one with fewer viewers in that period was in 2000, when President Clinton, in his final such address, was seen by just 31.5 million viewers. Nielsen listed 16 networks carrying the speech Tuesday, its biggest total ever. (In 2009, it was 10 networks.) The cable news networks use their numbers for the speech as signposts of interest among their news viewers. One network that saw an increase rather than a drop-off in viewers was Fox News, which totaled 4.7 million viewers, up 28 percent from last year, which easily topped its rivals. http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/business/media/address-by-obama-drew-fewest-viewers-since-2000.html Elton John, Lady Gaga, 'Dallas Buyers Club' Get GLAAD Nominations Pop stars Elton John and Lady Gaga, award-winning films ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" and the hit TV series ""Modern Family"" received nominations on Thursday from the GLAAD Media Awards. They were among 130 nominees named by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy organization, which monitors how the LGBT community is portrayed in the media. The 25th annual GLAAD Media Awards ceremonies are scheduled to be held in Los Angeles on April 12 and New York on May 3. Best picture Oscar nominees ""Dallas Buyers Club"" and ""Philomena"" will compete against 2013's Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or winner ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" for best wide-release film, along with the drama ""Kill Your Darlings"" and PG-13 rated ""The Moral Instrument: City of Bones,"" which is based on a series of novels for young adults. http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/30/us-glaad-awards-nominations-idUSBREA0T0P820140130 'Deport Justin Bieber' Petition Reaches 100,000+ Signatures Do you belieb that one of Canada's biggest exports could be deported as a result of his recent Miami arrest? The possibility is slim. Nevertheless, less than a week after it was first posted to the government's ""We the People"" platform, over 100,000 Americans have signed a petition asking the Obama administration to revoke Bieber's green card. (Why? Because ""he is not only threatening the safety of our people but he is also a terrible influence on our nations youth."") And according to the site's terms of participation, this means that the White House must now respond to the petition ""in a timely fashion."" Just don't expect that response to come soon — or to affirm that Bieber really will be kicked off our amber waves of grain. Facetious pop culture petitions aren't exactly a top priority for the White House; in the past, they've taken two months to respond to calls for the construction of a Death Star (""The Administration does not support blowing up planets"") and the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel Live! following an offensive segment (""The First Amendment of the Constitution protects free speech, even if individuals might personally find it offensive or distasteful""). http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/29/showbiz/celebrity-news-gossip/bieber-deport-petition-ew/?hpt=zite_zite1_featured Prince Drops $22m Pirate Action Against Fans Singer Prince has dropped a $22m legal action against fans accused of posting bootleg footage of his concerts online. The musician wanted $1m each from 22 internet users but, according to celebrity gossip website TMZ which has obtained court documents, he has now decided not to pursue the case. In a statement, the artist's lawyer told TMZ that the illegal downloads had been removed. Fans had reacted angrily to the news of the legal action. ""Because of recent pressure, the bootleggers have now taken down the illegal downloads and are no longer engaging in piracy,"" his lawyer said. ""We recognise the fans craving for as much material as possible, but we'd prefer they get it from us directly than from third parties who are scalpers rather than real fans of our work,"" the statement read. Media lawyer Steve Kuncewicz had told BBC Radio 5 live that the action was essentially ""going to war with his own fan base"". http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-25960300 Hollywood Hired Hands See Greener Pastures Outside California Greg Sproles, a muscular young man whose friends told him he looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger, quit his Orlando bartending job 12 years ago and moved to Hollywood to work in the moviemaking capital of the world. Much to his surprise, the work kept taking him back East. Film and TV production workers are packing up from Hollywood and moving to where the jobs are, as a host of states use tax incentives to poach production business from California. Last January, he pulled up stakes and moved to a new filmmaking mecca: Atlanta. Since then, he has stood in as Will Ferrell's body double on ""Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues,"" played a SWAT team member in the coming ""Fast & Furious 7"" and a peacekeeper in ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay—Part 1."" As film and TV production scatters around the country, more workers like Mr. Sproles are packing up from California and moving to where the jobs are. Driving this exodus of lower-wage workers—stunt doubles, makeup artists, production assistants and others who keep movie sets humming—are successful efforts by a host of states to use tax incentives to poach production business from California. The changing economics affect many major movies seen today. Only two movies with production budgets higher than $100 million filmed in Los Angeles in 2013, according to Film L.A. Inc., the city's movie office. In 1997, the year ""Titanic"" was released, every big-budget film but one filmed at least partially in the city. The number of feature-film production days in Los Angeles peaked in 1996 and fell by 50% through last year, according to Film L.A. Projects such as reality television and student films have picked up some of the slack. But overall entertainment-industry employment has slid. About 120,000 Californians worked in the industry in 2012, down from 136,000 in 2004, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579327070903007630?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702304419104579327070903007630.html Hugh Grant Fathers Third Love Child The famed British bachelor, 53, is now the father of three love children after Swedish TV producer Anna Elisabet Eberstein secretly gave birth to a baby boy in September 2013.

"Alert - White House, European Union Announce Additional Ukraine-Related Sanctions Designations Gibson Dunn Alert gd_banner Home · Practices · Lawyers · Diversity · Pro Bono · Firm News · Publications _____ White House, European Union Announce Additional Ukraine-Related Sanctions Designations _____ April 29, 2014 To Our Clients and Friends: In the Obama Administration's latest response to the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (""OFAC"") at the U.S. Department of the Treasury on Monday designated 7 individuals and 17 entities pursuant to Executive Order 13661 ""Blocking Property of Additional Persons Contributing the Situation in Ukraine.""[1] In a statement accompanying the new designations, the White House noted that the actions followed Russia's failure to meet commitments that were made on April 17, 2014 at a meeting in Geneva with the United States and the European Union.[2] The designations target certain Russian government officials and entities associated with President Putin's ""inner circle.""[3] Many of the sanctioned entities appear to be controlled either by Bank Rossiya, which was designated on March 16, or by previously sanctioned persons. Among the sanctioned persons is Igor Sechin, president and chairman of the management board of Rosneft, the Russian state-owned oil company. Rosneft itself has not been designated. The Administration also imposed visa bans and, for 13 of the 17 designated entities, a presumption of denial for export license requests. In particular, the State Department will now deny pending applications for export or re-export of any high technology defense articles or services regulated under the U.S. Munitions List to Russia or occupied Crimea that contribute to Russia's military capabilities, and will begin revoking existing export licenses meeting these conditions. The added sanctioned individuals and entities represent an expansion of efforts to pressure Russia. It is clear that the Obama Administration has plans that would further expand the scope of the designations. In the statement accompanying the designations, the White House indicated that it was prepared to sanction entities under Executive Order 13662,[4] which targets key sectors of the Russian economy, including financial services, energy, metals and mining, engineering and defense ""[i]f there is further Russian military intervention in Ukraine."" The European Union (EU) has also issued an additional list of 15 individuals identified as having taken actions that undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.[5] As with the previous lists of sanctioned persons, released on March 17, 2014,[6] and March 21, 2014,[7] these newly sanctioned individuals are now subject to a travel ban and freeze of their EU assets. The new list includes Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Nikolayevich Kozak, a deputy chairman of the Duma, Ludmila Ivanovna Shvetsova, and chief of staff of the Russian military, Valery Vasilevich Gerasimov. Notably--and unlike the United States--the EU only designated individuals, not companies. U.S. persons with operations in Europe or who are otherwise subject to EU legal authority should screen for these newly sanctioned individuals and those previously sanctioned by the EU to ensure that they are complying with the EU sanctions that apply to these persons, in addition to screening for individuals designated pursuant to the U.S. Executive Orders. In light of the ongoing actions, U.S. companies should prepare a comprehensive response to these developments, including the following actions: First, ensure that they are in compliance with these new sanctions and have blocked the property of the designated persons and designated entities. Second, screen potential business partners to ensure that they are not blocked by virtue of a 50 percent or greater ownership interest by a designated person or entity.[8] Third, exercise caution in dealings with entities with SDN ownership interest that--while significant--does not render the entity blocked under the 50% rule but leaves it vulnerable to future designation. The latest round of designations includes entities with a significant ownership interest by a previously designated person or entity. Fourth, make note of entities with designated persons in key management positions. While the presence of an SDN in management does not require blocking of the entity, it is unclear what, if any, restrictions exist on interactions with the SDN in the context of, for example, deal-making with the non-sanctioned entity. Fifth, U.S. companies should develop a strategy to respond in the event of reciprocal Russian sanctions against U.S. businesses. Finally, U.S. companies must monitor the developments for additional sanctions, particularly in connection with sectors targeted under Executive Order 13662. _____ [1] Exec.

"Daily Skimm: It's cookie time Is this email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser. SHARE THIS SHARE THIS Skimm for August 12th QUOTE OF THE DAY “Welcome to Cape Cod, President Obama. I nominate you” – 86-year-old Ethel Kennedy did the #IceBucketChallenge for ALS. Tag, Mr President. You’re it. Skimm This THINGS PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IRAQ THE STORY Yesterday, President Obama said that the US supports Iraq’s nomination for a new prime minister, giving the boot to current PM Maliki. WHY IS THIS A BIG DEAL? The US helped put Maliki in power…but that hasn’t worked out so well. Maliki’s government made a lot of other groups feel left out, which sprouted a ton of tension. And cue ISIS, a group that’s too scary even for al-Qaeda, and has been committing genocide throughout the country. Now, Maliki doesn’t want to step down, and has sent his security forces throughout Baghdad. Some are worried that this could lead to a coup. Since there isn’t enough chaos in Iraq right now. WHAT’S THE LATEST? Yesterday, we found out the US is supplying weapons to the Kurds (a group technically part of Iraq, but does its own thing). The Kurds had been losing a lot of ground to ISIS, but the US’ new intervention has helped change that. Until now, the US had only been working with the Iraqi government, so this is a significant policy shift. WHAT ARE PEOPLE SAYING ABOUT THE US IN IRAQ? Obama’s supporters are A-OK with giving aid and using airstrikes to fight ISIS, but really, really don’t want to see troops on the ground. Some critics are saying the airstrikes won’t do enough — and that the US should have stopped ISIS way back when ISIS was starting in Syria. theSKIMM ISIS is scary and it’s not going away anytime soon. Obama has made two other promises: to help rescue the religious minorities fleeing from ISIS, and to not put any US ground troops in Iraq. Some worry that accomplishing both could be tricky business. FERGUSON THE STORY You’ve been hearing a lot about a place in Missouri called Ferguson. Over the weekend, a black teenager named Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer there. Yesterday, the FBI opened an investigation. SO WHAT HAPPENED? Depends who you ask. The only thing we know for sure is that an unarmed black 18-year-old was killed by a police officer. Anti-police protests have broken out in Ferguson, with reports of looting, and over 30 people have been arrested. WHAT ARE THE PROTESTERS SAYING? That Brown had his hands in the air and was unarmed. That if police felt threatened, they could have just Tasered him. WHAT ARE THE POLICE SAYING? That a police officer was assaulted and there was a struggle over his gun. A man lost his life, and we are still trying to put together the facts. theSKIMM As a family mourns, a lot of other people are reminded of the Trayvon Martin shooting, which ignited a national debate. And a lot of people are questioning the police stats in Ferguson. REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED BY… The death of Robin Williams. The character actor and comedian who arrived as an alien named Mork, said “Good Morning, Vietnam,” grew up with you as the Genie, babysat you as “Mrs. Doubtfire” and taught you how to believe in “Hook,” passed away yesterday at age 63. His publicist said he was battling depression; he had recently checked into a rehab center to keep his sobriety in check. His death is believed to be a suicide. Williams’ career as an actor was anything but typecast. He won an Oscar for telling Matt Damon he’s just a kid in “Good Will Hunting” and was also known for his support of the troops. Williams is survived by his wife and three children. He will be missed. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR OFFICE NEMESIS SENDS YOU FLOWERS… Is this a trick? Russia reportedly sent 280 trucks of humanitarian aid to eastern Ukraine this morning, which it says is part of a Red Cross aid mission that also includes the US and EU. Except the Red Cross said it didn’t have info on what was in the Russian trucks and hadn’t exactly reached an agreement with Russia. If it sounds odd to you that Russia wants to help Ukraine, you’re not alone. The international community’s noticed that there are still tens of thousands of troops sitting on Ukraine’s border, and NATO is warning that there’s a “high probability” the Russians are going to take this opportunity to help pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. The Red Cross mission is supposed to bring aid to Ukrainians who haven’t had access to food and water, what with all that fighting going on in their backyard. Putin’s office promised that this is strictly out of the goodness of his Russian heart, and there will be no funny business. And then there was silence. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU ALMOST BUY A SHIRT AND IT SHOWS UP IN YOUR FEED… Feels like they’re working with each other here. Yesterday, media giant Conde Nast announced it’s marrying off shopping magazine Lucky to e-commerce platform BeachMint. Lucky has been getting no love from the rumor mill for years, with constant reports that it was on the verge of shutting down. But everyone’s been really excited about the brand lately since it hired a new editor. BeachMint has visible brands like StyleMint and ShoeMint, which are also collaborations with the Olsen twins and Rachel Bilson. The new company will be called The Lucky Group, with the goal of turning Lucky into a magazine you can literally shop through BeachMint. In case you didn’t get the message, they’re trying to make it a whole lot easier to read, and hit “buy” on impulse. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHILE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH… Hold the Colgate Total. Yesterday, Bloomberg News reported the popular toothpaste includes a chemical that has been linked to cancer and development issues in tests on animals. Enough to make you want to gargle, and then some. Even though Colgate removed the chemical from its soaps, it’s still in the toothpaste. Colgate says it went through a thorough process in 1997 to get the toothpaste approved by the FDA.

Still in the US. People are freaking out, and the CDC isn’t exactly making anyone feel calmer. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? Yesterday, the head of the CDC told lawmakers he’s “always open to ideas” on how to handle the whole Ebola thing. That’s so great to hear. WHAT ELSE? Some schools in Ohio and Texas have closed out of precaution. The second US nurse to be infected had flown from Ohio to Texas on Monday. Last night, a video of the first US nurse to be infected was released, in which she speaks in her Texas hospital room before being transferred to Maryland. Meanwhile, President Obama said he may appoint an “Ebola czar,” which sounds like a fun job. He also gave the Pentagon the OK to send reserve troops to West Africa to try to help contain the disease. theSKIMM Ebola’s shown that it’s a disease without borders and many would like some assurance that the US healthcare system’s ‘got this.’ Haven’t gotten that assurance yet. REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU’RE VERY LATE TO WORK… It could be worse. Last year, VP Joe Biden’s 44-year-old son Hunter took a part-time job as a public affairs officer in the Navy Reserve. Last February, he was discharged from the military but no one knew why. Yesterday, we found out it was because he’d reportedly tested positive for cocaine. Biden the Younger says he really regrets it. WHAT TO SAY TO WHILE HAVING DEJA-VU… Just a day after HBO announced it was cutting the cord, CBS did the same thing. It’s now launching its own stand-alone streaming service. The service will let people watch live programming, plus all its shows on the Internet — sans expensive TV package. “CBS All Access” will cost $5.99 a month. So “The Good Wife” is now a cheap date. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR COMPANY HIRES SOMEONE YOU DON’T LIKE… President Obama knows how that feels. Yesterday, Venezuela got a rotating seat at the UN Security Council, despite previous attempts by the US to keep the country in the corner. Though Venezuela has a place-card at the table for two years, it doesn’t have veto power like the five permanent countries in the council (US, UK, France, China, Russia). So this is a temporary, but significant soapbox for the country to stand on in the coming years. President Obama and Venezuelan President Maduro see eye-to-eye on…nothing…and the US isn’t into his socialist policies. On the flip side, Maduro’s accused Obama of trying to assassinate him. So everyone’s super excited. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY AT 9AM… Feels like there are nine innings left until the weekend. The San Francisco Giants are headed to the World Series, after beating the St. Louis Cardinals 6-3 last night. This will be the Giants’ third trip to the World Series in the last five years. And they’ll be facing the Kansas City Royals, who hadn’t made it to the Major League Baseball playoffs, let alone the World Series, in almost 30 years. Play ball. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU WANT TO GO INVISIBLE FOR A WHILE… There’s a cloak for that. But maybe not an app. In some encouraging ‘your phone, computer, and government are watching you’ news, yesterday The Guardian alleged that an app built on secret-keeping actually has a big mouth. Whisper, which allows users to anonymously post secrets, allegedly tracks the locations of its users, even ones who have specifically asked not to be followed. Comforting. The app also allegedly shares some info with the US Department of Defense. Whisper said ‘erroneous’ and denied the accusations. But after learning The Guardian would publish its story, Whisper reportedly changed its terms of service. It now says the company’s allowed to track the general location of users who’ve disabled the geolocation feature.

CVS Caremark officially stopped selling tobacco products yesterday. And changed its name to CVS Health. And now has better breath. Skimm This THINGS ON OBAMA’S MIND RUSSIA THE STORY Yesterday, Russian President Putin announced that he had a brilliant beyond brilliant cease-fire plan to end months of violence in Ukraine. President Obama yawned and said ‘I’ll bet you do.’ WHAT’S PUTIN’S PLAN? The pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine will stop fighting, if Ukraine withdraws its troops. That would be a big blow for Ukraine’s president, since he’s said for months the military won’t stop fighting until the separatists are “rooted out.” But after Russia invaded Ukraine last week (which Russia denies), Ukraine’s military has suffered some serious territorial losses. And a lot of negotiating leverage in the process. To the point where one Ukraine official said “any kind of cease-fire would be progress.” WHAT DOES THE WHITE HOUSE SAY? That Russia’s got a follow-through problem so don’t take this plan too seriously. World leaders are planning on gossiping about Russia at a NATO meeting today, and might just slap Russia with…wait for it…more sanctions. theSKIMM The peace talks continue tomorrow….to be continued… ISIS THE STORY When President Obama said last week that he didn’t have a strategy for fighting ISIS, it didn’t go over too well. So yesterday, he started talking strategy. WHAT’S HE SAYING? That the US wants to destroy ISIS. But needs some help. Today, he’s at the NATO summit making the case that his international friends need to join the US in the fight against the Islamic militant group. theSKIMM When Obama announced airstrikes in Iraq, he said it would be a “limited” campaign. Since then, ISIS has executed two US journalists. Makes ‘limited’ seem less likely. GUEST SKIMM: Karlie Kloss Model, Vogue.com contributor, can be found on this month’s Vogue cover Fashion Week starts in NYC today.

It’s an opportunity for designers to present new collections and for the fashion industry to celebrate the season ahead. It’s a big opportunity for the creative community to come together and share ideas. WHAT ARE THE DEETS? Shows happen all across New York City, from Lincoln Center to warehouses in Brooklyn. Designers’ collections and visions ultimately trickle down from the runway to street style. GIVE ME THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE UGLY The best part is the backstage culture and spending time with my friends. The most terrifying part is sleep deprivation, early morning calls and the late night fittings. HOW DO YOU CELEBRATE WHEN IT’S DONE? A great foot massage! Skimm This REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY WHILE BUILDING POWERPOINTS… Can’t stop, won’t stop. Michael Bloomberg is officially a workaholic. He is returning as head of Bloomberg LP, the data and media company he founded. Bloomberg handed off the top job while he was busy being NYC’s mayor for 12 years. But then he couldn’t figure out how to extend his term any further. When his stretch ended last year, he swore he had no interest — none, absolutely none — in sitting in the boss chair again, and was going to spend his time on philanthropy. That lasted eight months. Bloomie got antsy and started spending hours a day at the company, gorging on the free gourmet snacks, and generally making himself comfortable. CEO Dan Doctoroff came to Bloomberg recently and said King B should probably just take over again. Memo to Bloomberg employees: don’t show up to work today with a Big Gulp. Skimm This WHAT PEOPLE ARE WATCHING… The Justice Department. Today, it’s expected to open a civil rights investigation into the Ferguson, MO police department. Last month, unarmed black teen Michael Brown was shot and killed by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. This sparked weeks of mostly peaceful protests that gave way to violent clashes with police at night. Now, the Justice Department is reportedly going to investigate not just Wilson, but the entire police department to see if there is a pattern of problems in its culture. The investigation will reportedly go back many years and check into past allegations of misconduct – possibly including one case of a man who says he was beaten up by police and then charged with damaging government property for bleeding on their uniforms. WHAT TO SAY TO YOUR FRIEND WHO WANTS TO TAKE A TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS… Maybe not a trip to the altar. Yesterday, a federal judge upheld Louisiana’s gay marriage ban. Meaning gay couples can’t get married at Mardi Gras — or at anytime, anywhere in the state. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, paving the way for states to make up their own minds on who’s allowed to tie the knot. Over 20 states have overturned gay marriage bans since that ruling. Louisiana’s the first to uphold a ban. WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR CAR BATTERY LIGHT’S ON… Paging Elon Musk. Tesla, Musk’s electric car maker, is expected to drop the news today that the company has chosen Nevada as the spot to build its giant new battery factory. This factory is so special it has a name: gigafactory. It’s the ‘giga what, giga who’ Hova celeb of factories. Four states bid for it, but Nevada won out. Tesla’s planning on rolling out a new, cheaper car in a couple of years. And if it’s as popular as the Model S, the company is going to need this factory to keep up with production. Here’s hoping this is one step closer to the DeLorean. Skimm This THING TO KNOW Fantasy Football: If you’re ready for some football (or not), the season, both real and Fantasy, starts today.

"The Interview Media Coverage The Telegraph: North Korea slams US film The Interview about Kim Jong-un By Julian Ryall June 20, 2014 Exclusive: North Korea says Hollywood comedy about assassination of Kim Jong-un 'shows the desperation of the US government and American society' The North Korean regime has attacked a Hollywood comedy about the assassination of Kim Jong-un, saying it shows the ""desperation"" of American society. A spokesman for Mr Kim said the dictator would probably watch the film, starring Seth Rogan and James Franco, which is due to be released in October. The Interview is the tale of two talk show hosts who get the rare opportunity to travel to North Korea to interview its ruler. However, they are enlisted by the US government as undercover agents and ordered to assassinate Mr Kim, who is played by Korean-American actor Randall Park. A trailer for the film shows tank chases, missile launches and lavish banquets over which Mr Kim presides. Kim Myong-chol, executive director of The Centre for North Korea-US Peace and an unofficial spokesman for the regime in Pyongyang, was dismissive. ""There is a special irony in this storyline as it shows the desperation of the US government and American society,"" he told The Telegraph. ""A film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the US has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine,"" he added. ""And let us not forget who killed [President John F.] Kennedy – Americans. ""In fact, President [Barack] Obama should be careful in case the US military wants to kill him as well,"" Kim Myong-chol said. Kim Myong-chol dismissed Hollywood movies as being ""full of assassinations and executions"" and expressed the opinion that British films are far better and more realistic. ""James Bond is a good character and those films are much more enjoyable,"" he said. That appreciation for the escapades of MI6's finest does not stretch to Die Another Day, however, the 2002 film starring Pierce Brosnan which also cast the North Koreans as the baddies. Immediately after its release, North Korean state media described the film as ""dirty and cursed"". Kim Jong-il, Mr Kim's father, was famously parodied in the comedy hit film Team America, produced by the South park creators. Previews of The Interview have attracted mixed reviews, with some online commentators suggesting a comedy about murdering a genuine head of state is ""distasteful"" and ""extremely irresponsible"". ""I understand this is a comedy, but the last thing we need is a movie that mocks North Korea, let alone about assassinating their president,"" said one commentator on the Yahoo Movies website. ""It will only stir tensions further,"" the poster added. Variety: North Korea Slams Seth Rogen-James Franco Comedy ‘The Interview’ By Dave McNary June 20, 2014 North Korea is not amused by the upcoming James Franco-Seth Rogen comedy “The Interview.” The regime has already condemned the film, which won’t open until Oct. 10. Kim Myong-chol, executive director of The Centre for North Korea-US Peace and an unofficial spokesman for the regime in Pyongyang, was dismissive and said in an interview with The Telegraph. “There is a special irony in this storyline as it shows the desperation of the US government and American society,” he told The Telegraph. Franco portrays the host of a nighttime talk show “Skylark Tonight,” with Rogen as his best friend and producer, and secures an interview with Kim Jong-Un, the mysterious and ruthless dictator of North Korea. The duo is then approached by the CIA and asked to assassinate Jong-Un, played by Korean-American actor Randall Park. Rogen reacted to the story with a tweet on his account. Myong-chol told The Telegraph that the dictator would probably watch the film despite the government’s opposition. “A film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the US has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine,” he added. “And let us not forget who killed [President John F.] Kennedy – Americans. In fact, President [Barack] Obama should be careful in case the US military wants to kill him as well.” Kim Myong-chol also told the newspaper that James Bond movies are better than Hollywood films. Sony released its first trailer for “The Interview” on June 11. TheWrap: James Franco and Seth Rogen's ‘The Interview’ Slammed by North Korea By Eric Czuleger June 20, 2014 Kim Jong-Un is not impressed with American comedy comrades Kim Jong-un is not laughing at the antics of Seth Rogen and James Franco in their new film, “The Interview.” In a conversation with Kim Myon-chol, the executive director for The Centre for North Korea-U.S. Peace, The London Telegraph found that “The Hermit Kingdom” is not pleased about the impending release of the buddy comedy. The film follows James Franco as a late night talk show host who scores an interview with Kim Jong-un. The CIA decides to turn the host and his producer (Seth Rogen) into assassins. State sanctioned hilarity ensues. The unofficial spokesman for Pyongyang, who lives in Japan, said that the film “shows the desperation of the U.S. government and American society.” Despite the film's supposed attempt to subjugate the workers of the world, Kim Myon-chol said that Kim Jong-Un would probably watch the film. The North Korean spokesperson snuck in one more zinger during his interview with The Telegraph: “A film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the U.S. has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine.” He then went on to say, “Let us not forget who killed Kennedy– Americans.” Kim Myon-chol finished the interview by warning President Obama to be careful in case the U.S. military wants to kill him as well. The message has been received loud and clear in Hollywood. Seth Rogen tweeted about the interview, saying: We can only hope that “The Great Successor” develops a sense of humor between now and the Oct. 2 release date. Entertainment Weekly: Kim Jong-un will probably watch Seth Rogen's comedy about assassinating Kim Jong-un By Ashley Fetters June 20, 2014 Last week, Columbia released the first trailer for The Interview, in which a talk-show host (James Franco) and his producer (Seth Rogen) land an interview with Kim Jong-un, supreme leader of North Korea (played by Korean-American actor Randall Park) and become miserably underqualified hit men when the CIA enlists their help in assassinating Kim. It’s a funny enough premise in America, where many are more familiar with Kim as an eternally springing fountain of Internet hilarity than as a real political figure. On Friday, though, a spokesman for Kim told The Daily Telegraph that the supreme leader would probably watch The Interview when it comes out in October. There’s hate-watching, and then there’s hate-watching; given that the trailer depicts a vaguely sinister-looking, always-armed Kim Jong-un who insists he doesn’t defecate or urinate and can talk to dolphins, this viewing experience will likely fit into the latter category. Kim Myong-chol, an unofficial spokesman for Kim’s regime, offered more comments: “There is a special irony in this storyline as it shows the desperation of the U.S. government and American society,” he told The Telegraph. “A film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the U.S. has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine,” Kim Myong-chol said, adding that he prefers British cinema—specifically James Bond films—to U.S.-made features. Hollywood films, Kim said, are “full of assassinations and executions.” The Guardian: North Korea rubbishes Seth Rogen comedy The Interview By Ben Child June 20, 2014 Film starring James Franco alongside co-director Rogen draws ire of isolated state in connection with plotline around assassination of leader Kim Jong-un The Interview film still Talk is cheap ... James Franco and Seth Rogen in The Interview. Photograph: PR North Korea has blasted a new Hollywood comedy in which two American television workers are recruited to try and kill Kim Jong-un, calling it a symbol of the ""desperation"" of US society. However, Kim Myong-chol, who is often described as an ""unofficial"" spokesperson for the communist nation's ""supreme leader"", said the dictator would probably watch the movie anyway. The Interview stars James Franco and Seth Rogen as a talk show host and producer who are asked by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong-un after discovering that he is a fan of their celebrity interview programme. A recent trailer showed the pair being briefed by Lizzy Kaplan's intelligence agent about the dictator's raging eccentricities, which according to the film include convincing his people that their leader can speak to dolphins, and that he never urinates or defecates. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Kim Myong-chol dismissed The Interview's lampooning of Kim Jong-un out of hand and said American film-makers should look to their country's own history. ""There is a special irony in this storyline as it shows the desperation of the US government and American society,"" he said. ""A film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the US has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. And let us not forget who killed [President John F] Kennedy – Americans. ""In fact, President [Barack] Obama should be careful in case the US military wants to kill him as well,"" added the spokesman for good measure. Kim Myong-chol, whose title is executive director of the Centre for North Korea-US Peace, expressed a preference for British films. He said this was because Hollywood movies were ""full of assassinations and executions"", adding: ""James Bond is a good character and those films are much more enjoyable."" It would appear the regime has a short memory, or at least has shown the good taste to ignore Pierce Brosnan's critically-reviled final outing as 007, 2002's Die Another Day. The box office smash featured a plot about North Korean villains which authorities described at the time as ""dirty and cursed"". Rogen co-wrote and co-directed The Interview with his regular collaborator Evan Goldberg. The film stars Korean-American actor Randall Park as Kim Jong-un and hits cinemas on both sides of the Atlantic in October. Attachments: image001.jpg (12042 Bytes) image002.jpg (6850 Bytes)",Private
"The Daily TIP: TODAY'S DATE Trouble viewing this email? Click here for the web version of the Daily TIP. October 21, 2014 Congressional Democrats blast White House over reported plans to freeze Congress out of Iran deal Israel’s Dr. Eli Harari honored with ‘National Medal of Technology and Innovation’ Top Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday blasted the Obama administration for reportedly planning to circumvent Congress in securing a nuclear deal with Iran that would reduce sanctions on the Islamic republic, after controversy erupted in the wake of a New York Times column assessing that ""President Obama will do everything in his power to avoid letting Congress vote on"" a nuclear deal between the P5+1 global powers and Iran. Foreign Policy Magazine conveyed a statement from Eliot Engel (D-NY), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, bluntly stating that the lawmaker ""disagree[d] with the administration's reported assertion that it does not need to come to Congress at this point during negotiations with Iran."" The outlet also quoted Steve Israel (D-NY), the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, saying that ""as negotiations continue on a deal to prevent a nuclear Iran, Congress cannot be circumvented."" Analysts, lawmakers, and journalists had for months assumed that the administration would need the Hill's cooperation in implementing any deal with Iran, if only because previously passed sanctions legislation would require new legislation to roll back. Recent weeks had nonetheless seen doubts emerge over whether the administration would be able to secure Congressional approval of a likely deal. A range of stories indicated that Western negotiators had caved to Tehran on a range of core issues, including on a long-standing international demand that Tehran dismantle its uranium-enriching centrifuges. Bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress had declared that such dismantlement was a vital component of any acceptable deal. Meanwhile new reports emerged Tuesday indicating that the West's posture has eroded further. The Los Angeles Times conveyed Iranian media reports boasting that the American position regarding enrichment has again eroded, and that Washington has now ""sweetened its offer to Iran in ongoing nuclear negotiations, saying it might accept Tehran operating 4,000 centrifuges, up from the previous 1,300."" Dr. Eli Harari, the Israeli founder and retired chairman & CEO of SanDisk Corporation has been selected as one of the 2014 honorees of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, the United States’ highest honor recognizing achievement and leadership in advancing the fields of science and technology. President Barack Obama recently announced the nine recipients to win this year’s awards. “These scholars and innovators have expanded our understanding of the world, made invaluable contributions to their fields, and helped improve countless lives,” President Obama said in announcing the recipients. “Our nation has been enriched by their achievements and by all the scientists and technologists across America dedicated to discovery, inquiry, and invention.” SanDisk is a global leader in flash storage solutions. Dr. Harari’s vision for the company and flash memory began more than 26 years ago. Throughout the years flash memory innovations have transformed and enabled new markets and devices from digital photography to USB drives to smart phones, tablets, and thin-and-light notebooks. Flash memory is on track to become the most widely used memory technology in the world over the next decade, according to a SanDisk press release. “We’re now connected in ways that would not be possible without the technologies that Eli helped pioneer and we’re well positioned to take on new market segments such as enterprise data centers,” said Sanjay Mehrotra, co-founder, president and chief executive officer of SanDisk. “Eli has had a profound impact on the entire technology landscape, and in doing so, has truly changed the world as we experience it today. His lifelong intellectual and technical achievements are well-deserving of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.” From a startup in 1988, SanDisk now employs more than 8,000 people worldwide, has over 5,000 patents and $6.5 billion in annual sales. A White House press statement says the National Medal of Technology and Innovation “recognizes those who have made lasting contributions to America’s competitiveness and quality of life and helped strengthen the nation’s technological workforce.” The new awardees will receive their medals at a White House ceremony later this year.

If you can, please make a small grassroots donation today.https://action.dccc.org/Streisand-Email(your donation to this email will be Triple-Matched) Thanks, Nancy Pelosi ---------- Original Message ----------From: Barbra Streisand Dear Amy, Have you seen Congress lately? It’s a mess. And it’s only going to get worse if people like Karl Rove and the Koch Brothers continue to treat corporations better than people. That’s why I wanted to make sure you saw President Obama’s call-to-action. Just this week in Texas, voting rights were dismantled, essentially blocking minorities and many students and seniors from voting. Whether you know it or not, in the past 6-years we have seen huge progress under President Obama. Unemployment is at the lowest level since before President Obama took office, before the Great Recession started. The deficit is rapidly dropping and is just 2.8% of GDP -- the lowest since 2007. And thank God for President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which has helped millions of people around the country gain access to health care. Additionally, he has championed equal pay for women while Republicans try to take away long-term unemployment insurance and kill a minimum wage increase.There is still so much more we can do. And that can only be achieved with an active Congress, not an obstructive one. That is why it is so important to support Democratic candidates. I’m asking for your help. We have to act now. There’s only a few days left. We’re running out of time and money. I know we can win, but we need your help! You can make a difference. All Gifts Today Will Be Triple-Matched!

"Daily Skimm: Get. Up. Is this email not displaying correctly? View it in your browser. SHARE THIS SHARE THIS Skimm for August 13th QUOTE OF THE DAY “She looks forward to hugging it out” – An aide to Hillary Clinton, alluding to the tension that’s been brewing all week between Hillz and President Obama. Hillz had some thoughts on his foreign policy decisions in Syria and shared them. They’ll be at the same party tonight. Fake smiles all around. Skimm This THINGS NOT DOING SO WELL FERGUSON THE STORY Ferguson, MO is having a rough time, after an unarmed black teen was shot dead by a police officer last weekend. Protesters have been clashing with police ever since. WHAT DO WE KNOW? Michael Brown, who was 18-years-old and unarmed, was shot multiple times and killed by a police officer. The police are mostly keeping quiet as they investigate the case, but have said that there was a struggle, and the officer’s weapon was fired inside the patrol car. Brown’s family and witnesses say Brown was shot while holding his hands in the air in surrender – which is why you’ve seen so many photos like this. TELL ME ABOUT FERGUSON. It’s a small suburb in St. Louis where stats show that police have stopped, searched, and arrested many more black people than white. If you look at images of what’s going on now, you might feel like you’re looking at a flashback to an ugly time in America’s history. Think: police in riot gear using tear gas and firing wooden pellets on sometimes-violent protesters. Yesterday, the FAA issued a no-fly-zone over Ferguson after police said one of their helicopters was shot at on Sunday night. Then last night, a police officer shot and critically wounded a person who police say pulled a gun on the officer. Not a good scene. theSKIMM Yesterday, President Obama called Brown’s death “heartbreaking” and said the Justice Department is investigating. There’s a lot we don’t know about what happened the night Brown was killed. And his death has hit a nerve not just in Ferguson, but in the rest of the country. THE YAZIDIS THE STORY Iraq is in a bad way. And tens of thousands of Yazidis – a small religious minority in northern Iraq – have been trapped on a mountain, hiding from ISIS militants, who have already killed hundreds of them. WAIT, BACK UP. Reminder: ISIS is the Islamic militant group terrorizing Iraq and grabbing land to make its own Islamic State. Thousands of Christians in the country are already threatened. When the group moved into Yazidi towns recently, they reportedly buried some people alive and took hundreds of women as slaves. The Yazidis fled up a mountain, where they’ve been struggling to survive. They’re a big part of the reason the US started “targeted airstrikes” and delivering humanitarian aid to Iraq last week – and why yesterday, the Pentagon said it’s sending an extra 130 US military advisers to help. Meanwhile, a helicopter crashed yesterday while trying to rescue refugees, killing the pilot, and injuring others. ANYTHING ELSE? Thousands of Yazidis have also been able to escape with help from Syrian Kurds. New group alert: the Syrian Kurds are an independent ethnic group just over the Iraq border. Yes, there are also Kurds in Iraq. The Syrian Kurds have been escorting thousands of Yazidis down the mountain, bringing them to Syria, and helping some cross back into Iraq. Otherwise known as the non-scenic route. theSKIMM The Yazidis are just one religious minority living with the fear of genocide now that ISIS is trying to establish itself. REPEAT AFTER ME... WHAT TO SAY TO YOUR FRIEND WHO CAN’T WHISTLE… Lauren Bacall knew best. The iconic actress who taught Humphrey Bogart how to whistle in “To Have and Have Not” passed away yesterday at age 89. She won Bogart over in real life too — they married in 1945 — and were one of Hollywood’s most legendary couples. The Oscar-nominated actress was known for “The Look” – a head-down, eyes-up stare that became her trademark. She worked with every Hollywood star you can think of in films like “How to Marry a Millionaire,” “The Big Sleep,” and “The Mirror Has Two Faces.” The Oscar-nominated actress was also a big hit on Broadway, winning Tonys for best actress in “Applause,” and “Woman of the Year.” It’s been a tough week for Hollywood. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU GET A REZ AT AN OLD FAVORITE RESTAURANT… Back at the table. Some registered lobbyists are being allowed back on federal advisory boards, after getting banned by the White House in 2010. Sidenote: lobbyists are hired by companies and industry groups to drop some game and influence lawmakers in DC. President Obama took issue with the fact that many lobbyists work in the private sector, and had too much say in government policy. A group of lobbyists challenged the ban, saying that Obama was violating their constitutional rights, their right to Happy Hour, and also alienating experts who could serve as key advisors on issues. Now, lobbyists will be allowed to serve on advisory boards as “representatives” as long as they’re serving some sort of a corporation or association. Welcome to excitement in DC. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE CALLS YOU AND HANGS UP… Well that was a waste of time. Lyft, a San Francisco-based ride-sharing app, has accused rival Uber of wasting tons of its time, claiming that Uber employees have called Lyft and ordered over 5,000 cars…and then canceled them. This U-turn isn’t just costing mileage – it’s making Lyft drivers unavailable to people who call in. Guess who people call next for a ride? Hint: rhymes with goober. Lyft also accused Uber employees of trying to convince Lyft drivers to come work at Uber. Uber responded by saying Lyft was also ridin’ dirty, and cancelled nearly 13,000 Uber rides. In the time it takes you read this, you could have just hailed a taxi. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOUR COMPUTER CRASHES… Can I sue? Last month, thousands of law students taking the bar exam using a company called ExamSoft experienced software failure. What’s worse than pissing off a bunch of sleep-deprived students? Pissing off a bunch of sleep-deprived students who just learned how to sue you. Five law students have sued ExamSoft for future earnings, after the glitch prevented them from uploading their exam answers. ExamSoft said it was a server issue, due to upgrades that were meant to improve the exam experience. Fail. Law students are well, laying down the law on Twitter too – many are venting with the hashtags #Barmageddon and #Barghazi. Hot mess, bar none. Skimm This WHAT TO DO FIRST THING AFTER READING theSKIMM… Check the weather. The US is experiencing some nasty extreme weather this week. Detroit saw the most rain in almost a century earlier this week. And no one was singing in it. Yesterday, over six inches of flooding closed major freeways. Two people died from the flooding. In Florida, a possibly toxic algae bloom is closing in on the coast. Yes, it’s the same kind of thing that caused the Ohio water ban last week. And if you live in the Northeast, better bring your umbrella-ella-ella to work today because there are flash flood warnings and a ton of rain expected. PS California would like some of that rain. Skimm This WHAT TO SAY WHEN SOMEONE MENTIONS DONALD STERLING… He’s out of the game. For good. Yesterday, the NBA announced that former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer officially bought the LA Clippers. Now, Clippers players can add IT to their benefits. Skimm This THING TO KNOW STDs…No, not herpes. What some people think is a good way to refer to “Save the Date” invites. It’s not a good way.

"PETITION: Boehner Lawsuit Denounce John Boehner’s baseless lawsuit against President Obama >> John Boehner’s lawsuit against President Obama is baseless -- and a complete waste of OUR tax dollars. But Republican leaders are claiming they already have 1OO,OOO signatures backing Boehner’s lawsuit, so we need to fight back. We’ve set an ambitious goal of 2OO,OOO people denouncing Boehner’s plan to use our tax dollars to sue the President. Will you sign our petition demanding Boehner drop his baseless lawsuit against President Obama? NAME: Amy Pascal PETITION SIGNATURE: PENDING >> Sign Your Name >> Amy -- BOEHNER’S GONE TOO FAR.

And he wants to use YOUR tax dollars to do it! We want to get 2OO,OOO signatures on our petition telling Boehner we do NOT want him using our tax dollars to pay for his frivolous lawsuit against President Obama. Sign our petition to show Boehner that you won’t let your tax dollars be spent to fund his crusade. Thanks, Democratic Headquarters P.S.

"I just need to say this: I’m sick of Obama-bashing Republicans. No President in U.S. history has faced the level of obstruction that Barack Obama has. And this month has been especially brutal: -- Boehner’s paying lawyers $500/hour to sue President Obama -- More House Republicans are outright calling for impeachment -- Mitch McConnell is threatening the President with another government shutdown It’s all absolutely outrageous.And if Republicans win complete control of Congress in November, it’ll get exponentially worse.

"Variety: David Fincher in Talks to Direct Aaron Sorkin's Steve Jobs Biopic (2/26/14) Variety: David Fincher in Talks to Direct Aaron Sorkin’s Steve Jobs Biopic by Justin Kroll Would reteam him with ""The Social Network"" producer Scott Rudin and scribe Aaron Sorkin After delivering the critical and box office smash “The Social Network,” Sony has commissioned the Facebook drama’s creative team for another high-profile techie-themed biopic, this time about Apple founder and tech pioneer Steve Jobs. Sources tell Variety that David Fincher is in early talks to direct the untitled drama, written by Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and produced by Scott Rudin. The film is based on the Walter Isaacson biography “Steve Jobs,” to which Sony acquired the rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011. Sorkin finished the script earlier this year. Guymon Casady and Mark Gordon are also on board as producers. Sorkin has publicly said the Jobs biopic will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s infamous product launches. “The first one being the Mac,” he told the Daily Beast. “The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod.” “It’s a little like writing about the Beatles,” he added. “There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.” Fincher, who last directed “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” for Sony, is currently in post-production on Fox’s “Gone Girl.” If a deal is completed, filming would most likely not begin to later this year. Though audiences didn’t rush to see Open Road’s Ashton Kutcher-starring ”Jobs” last year, Sony is confident the Fincher-Sorkin project will have more commercial appeal, given the high-profile creative team involved, not to mention the fact that it’s based on the only authorized biography that Jobs would give his blessing to prior to his death. The biography, released in 2011, is based on more than 40 interviews Isaacson had with Jobs as well as more than 100 interviews with friends, family and a v",Private
"Deadline: David Fincher for Steve Jobs? From Deadline: David Fincher For Steve Jobs? By MIKE FLEMING JR | Wednesday February 26, 2014 @ 8:32am PST Rumors over the last week have David Fincher circling the Aaron Sorkin-scripted Steve Jobs biopic based on the Walter Isaacson book about the Apple genius at Sony. Fincher hasn’t even had a meeting on the project yet, but he certainly has a close relationship with producer Scott Rudin from The Social Network. Will it happen? Who knows? At this point he read the script and they will have a conversation, and this is as far as this has gone — no negotiations at this point. But there is a rush right now to publish tips from tracking boards that make it difficult to not be compelled to run every single rumor. ----- Original Message ----- From: Pascal, Amy To: Belgrad, Doug Cc: Guerin, Jean; Cantillon, Elizabeth; Sipkins, Charles Sent: Wed Feb 26 07:38:18 2014 Subject: Re: Jobs biopic/Fincher Leak Michael....

"THR: David Fincher in Early Talks to Direct Steve Jobs Film for Sony (2/26/14) The Hollywood Reporter: David Fincher in Early Talks to Direct Steve Jobs Film for Sony (Exclusive) by Tatiana Siegel Based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography, the film would reteam Fincher with ""Social Network"" writer Aaron Sorkin and producer Scott Rudin. David Fincher already has tackled one Silicon Valley billionaire in Mark Zuckerberg. Now, the Social Network director is poised to take on the late Steve Jobsfor Sony. Fincher is in early talks to helm the untitled film based on Walter Isaacson’s best-selling biography of the Apple co-founder, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. If a deal comes together, the film would reunite the director with Oscar-winning Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin, who recently finished the adaptation, and the film's producer Scott Rudin. Like Zuckerberg, Jobs was a complicated visionary who became a polarizing figure. Under Jobs' watch, Apple revolutionized several business, including personal computers, music, computer-generated animation and mobile phones. In the process, he became known as one of the greatest innovators of his generation. At the same time, he was unapologetic about his difficult personality, was at one point ousted at Apple and was criticized for the harsh treatment of workers in China who assembled Apple products. Jobs' life already has inspired one big-screen feature: Open Road's 2011 film Jobs, starring Ashton Kutcher, which grossed just $35 million worldwide. But the Sorkin-penned project is considered a much more high-profile project due to the pedigree of those involved and the popularity of Isaacson's book, for which he obtained unrivaled access to Jobs during the last years of his life. Sony boarded the project in October 2011, just weeks after Jobs succumbed to pancreatic cancer. Sorkin began writing the script in 2012, though he also has been heavily involved in his HBO series The Newsroom. No actor is attached yet, though the chance to play Jobs for Fincher and Sorkin likely would pique the interest of many A-list stars. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is participating in the film as a consultant. Fincher is a notoriously picky director who can go years between film projects. He last directed Sony’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which Rudin produced. Though the film was well received and earned more than $200 million worldwide, it never spawned a second and third chapter, as originally planned. He recently finished shooting the Fox/New Regency mystery Gone Girl, based on Gillian Flynn’s best-seller. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike star. Fincher also just launched season two of the critically acclaimed Netflix series House of Cards, which he executive produces. Fincher and Flynn also are reteaming on the HBO series Utopia.

"Steve Jobs Film Moving From Sony; Will Universal Make The Movie?by Mike Fleming Jr November 19, 2014 6:36pm EXCLUSIVE: In a shocking development, the Aaron Sorkin-scripted film about Apple genius Steve Jobs has been put in turnaround by Sony Pictures, and Universal Pictures is making a strong play for the movie. The film, an adaptation of the bestselling Walter Isaacson biography, has Slumdog Millionaire‘s Danny Boyle set to direct, with Michael Fassbender recently courted to play Jobs. The film is produced by Scott Rudin, Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady.The film has been on a very fast track, even as the filmmakers have worked to lock down a lead actor. There was a previous courtship of Christian Bale, which didn’t come to fruition. A speedy move to another studio would keep the momentum of the project intact.

"THR: Christian Bale Drops Out of Steve Jobs Movie (Exclusive) By Borys Kit, Tatiana SiegelNovember 3, 2014 Sources say the actor came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the actor has fallen off the Jobs biopic that is being directed by Danny Boyle. The Sony project, which has a script by Aaron Sorkin and is being produced by Scott Rudin, Guymon Casady and Mark Gordon, was on track to begin shooting this winter for a quick turnaround. Boyle is due in town this week to meet with actors and actresses for the movie. Seth Rogen is in discussions to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak but no official offer has been made. It is unclear how Bale’s departure will affect casting. Sources say Bale, after much deliberation and conflicting feelings, came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw. The script is said to be divided into three acts which detail Jobs preparing for three presentations that came to define his life and the life of the company he co-founded, lost and came back to. Bale marks the second high-profile actor to receive an offer from Sony for the Jobs role but eventually pass. Leonardo DiCaprio also was in line for the late tech icon before moving on to shoot The Revenant. Neither had begun negotiations.

"Variety: Michael Fassbender In Talks to Play Steve Jobs in Biopic By Justin Kroll November 4, 2014 With Christian Bale parting ways on the project, Sony has moved quickly to find their man to portray the late Apple founder Steve Jobs. Michael Fassbender is in early talks to play “Jobs” in the the Sony biopic that Danny Boyle is directing, sources confirm. Based on Walter Isaacson’s biography “Steve Jobs,” the real-life drama is directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin. Scott Rudin will produce along with Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady. Sorkin has publicly said the movie will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s famous product launches. “The first one being the Mac,” he told the Daily Beast. “The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod.” “It’s a little like writing about the Beatles,” he added. “There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.” Leonardo DiCaprio had been circling the role but eventually passed to take time off from acting. David Fincher had also been in talks at one point to direct. Sony acquired rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011.

As you know, we've confirmed that on Gone Girl Fincher is getting his quote $10M v 10%GP. Josh thinks that the cost is approx. $65M, but contractually, Fincher was entitled to his full deal if the movie was as low as $53M (and perhaps less). Josh also asked whether Sorkin had cut his fees (as a matter of act, we gave Sorkin a bump for this project), as a way of suggesting that Fincher will be resistant to any fee cutting at this point if others are not. So, if we're attaching Fincher to this now, and time is of the essence, which it seems to be, my suggestion is that we book Fincher at his $10M v 10%GP quote and then when we know more about the projected production cost, who the lead is, and what the p&l looks like with those variables plugged in, we can go back to folks, if necessary, and get them to do what's needed to fit into the box.

"Re: STEVE JOBS -- Book Sales Copy that! Maybe it got a little nitpicky as it went on?

"Steve Jobs / Fincher I spoke with Josh this morning about Fincher. As you know, we've confirmed that on Gone Girl Fincher is getting his quote $10M v 10%GP. Josh thinks that the cost is approx. $65M, but contractually, Fincher was entitled to his full deal if the movie was as low as $53M (and perhaps less). Josh also asked whether Sorkin had cut his fees (as a matter of act, we gave Sorkin a bump for this project), as a way of suggesting that Fincher will be resistant to any fee cutting at this point if others are not. So, if we're attaching Fincher to this now, and time is of the essence, which it seems to be, my suggestion is that we book Fincher at his $10M v 10%GP quote and then when we know more about the projected production cost, who the lead is, and what the p&l looks like with those variables plugged in, we can go back to folks, if necessary, and get them to do what's needed to fit into the box. Is that alright with everyone? mm",Private

"JOBS Breakdown Hope it's not too little too late – saw that you sent yourself notes – but here's a sequence breakdown of JOBS. Attached and below. JOBS Breakdown Pg. 1-7: 1984, Flint Auditorium. STEVE JOBS, JOANNA HOFFMAN, the head of Marketing for the Mac, and ANDY HERTFELD, a Mac programmer, debate whether the original Mac will say “hello” to the audience as planned during the first Apple Keynote. The keep their voices down because JOEL PFORZHEIMER, an interviewer from GQ is in the audience. Steve also sees his ex-wife CHRISANN BRENNAN, and the girl who he claims is not his daughter, LISA BRENNAN, in the audience. Steve asks his publicist, ANDREA (Andy) CUNNINGHAM, to cover the exit signs so they get a full blackout. Pg. 7-15: Jobs’ dressing room. Jobs and Joanna argue over 1) whether the Mac will say hello and whether to cut it or stop the presentation, 2) the fact that Steve isn’t on the cover of TIME Magazine, a computer is, 3) Jobs’ forecast that a million Macs being sold in the first 90 days, and 4) the fact that Jobs, in the TIME article about him, denies being Lisa Brennan’s father. Pg. 15-20: Jobs’ dressing room. Chrisann wants money from Steve, and mentions the TIME article. Jobs denies being Lisa’s father, and denies having named a computer, the LISA, after his non-daughter. Pg. 20-24: Backstage. Andy Hertzfeld tries to convince JOBS that the voice demo won’t work, Jobs threatens to humiliate him publicly. Steve asks for a white shirt with breast pocket to hold the software disk in. Pg. 24-32 Jobs’ dressing room. Steve still denies being Lisa’s dad, Chrisann asks for more money, Lisa gets on Steve’s computer and starts playing, makes a painting on Paint. Jobs decides to give Chrisann more money, even though there’s only a 94.1% chance that he’s Lisa’s father (he argues somehow that that means mathematically that 28% of men in America could be Lisa’s dad). Pg. 32-42: Jobs’ dressing room. Steve Wozniak wants Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team during his keynote. Steve says no. During their argument we FLASH BACK to when they were working out of a garage, making the original Apple computer. Pg. 42-44: Joel Pforzheimer points out that some of the Mac technology seems like it came directly out of Xerox products. Pg. 44-46: Backstage. Andy has found a way to make the voice demo work. Pg. 47-53: Backstage. John Sculley, Jobs’ CEO of Apple, drinks wine with Steve to celebrate. They talk about how the board should be changed to include more Steve-friendly members. They seem like extremely close friends and partners. Pg. 53-55: News reports tell us that the Macintosh was a huge flop, and that Steve Jobs was fired from Apple. Pg. 55-58: 1988. Symphony Hall. The launch of the CUBE. GEORGE COATES, creative director of the event, and Jobs discuss the focus of the pool of light on stage. Joanna tells Steve that both Woz and John Sculley are at the event. Jobs is not pleased. Pg. 58-61: Catacombs of Symphony Hall. Joanna and Steve talk about the strategy for the launch of the cube which, although a perfect cube, can’t do almost anything. Pg. 62-65: Jobs’ Dressing Room. Lisa surprises Steve. It seems like Chrisann is having Lisa do strange chores like wake her up, and Lisa and Steve discuss the cube. Pg. 66-69: Various. Woz and Jobs walk, and Woz tries to make amends, but Jobs remembers everything that Woz said to reporters after Jobs was fired. Pg. 69-73: Stage. George and Jobs rehearse the presentation. Lisa watches. Pg. 73-79: Orchestra pit. Jobs and Woz argue about what happened between them after the last launch. Pg. 79-82: Corridor. Joanna and Jobs prep for the launch, aware that the Cube may crash. Joanna is becoming increasingly suspicious of Jobs’ plan here. Pg. 82-85: Jobs’ dressing room. Jobs yells at Chrisann for her bad parenting. Pg. 85-88: Verious. Joel Pforzheimer, the same GQ writer, gets Steve to admit that the Operating System (OS) for the Cube isn’t finished. Andy Hertzfeld and AVIE TEVANIAN (software engineer) explain. Pg. 88-91: Backstage. Andy tells Jobs there’s a good chance the computer will crash. He also mentions a parody article in which Jobs creates an OS that Apple needs and they buy him back into the company. Pg. 91-97: Various. Jobs finds Lisa in the rafters of the auditorium. They talk about the Joni Mitchell song “Both Sides Now,” Jobs makes Chrisann take Lisa back to school. Pg. 97-115: Jobs’ dressing room. Jobs and Sculley argue about the night when the board shut down Mac production as we FLASH BACK to it. Sculley has long been skewed as the villain of this story because of the way it was relayed to reporters, but in fact it wasn’t so black and white. Sculley had been in Jobs’ corner, but Jobs’ arrogance and his disdain for the board made them all the more keen to throw him out. The night when Sculley told Jobs that the Mac was being shut down, an emergency board meeting was called, Jobs continued to show his arrogance in the meeting, and the board voted him out. In the present, Sculley asks Jobs for help clearing his name to the press, and Jobs shoots him down. Pg. 115-117: Corridor. Joanna has figured out Jobs’ plan – sink the Cube, but invent an OS that Apple needs desperately so they buy him back (like the parody report predicted). Jobs goes on stage for the presentation. Pg. 117-120: News reports tell us of Jobs’ return to Apple, as predicted. Pg. 120-122: 1998. Flint Auditorium (same place as the original launch). Jobs rehearses his speech for his launch of the iMac. Pg. 122-127: Various. Jobs, Andy, Woz, and Joanna discuss the launch. Estimations show that the iMac will do huge numbers and be a history-altering success. Even Sculley offered a quote in agreement. Pg. 128-140: Jobs’ dressing room. Joanna and Steve argue about, mainly, Jobs saying that he would not pay for Lisa’s college tuition because she signed the house that Jobs bought her over to Chrisann. Joanna reveals that Andy paid for Lisa’s tuition. Jobs brings Andy in and yells at him for paying Lisa’s tuition. Jobs asks Joanna to bring Lisa backstage. Pg. 140-154: Various. Lisa won’t come backstage. Jobs goes to the stage, where he talks to Joel Pforzheimer about Alan Turing (the inventor of the original computer during WWII) and watches as one of the slides (a photo of a shark) is changed out. Woz and Jobs fight, as Woz tries to convince Jobs to not lay off the Apple II engineers, but Jobs isn’t having it. Woz accuses Jobs of having no respect for him. Pg. 154-156: Corridor/dressing room. Joanna reveals to Jobs that there’s no way he would ever have been on the cover of TIME in 1994. Pg. 156-165: Dressing room. Sculley surprises Jobs in his room. Sculley tries to bury the hatchet as we FLASH BACK to the first day that they met. For a moment it looks like Jobs realizes that he may have screwed up their relationship. Sculley helps him to just let it go. Pg. 165-170: Corridor. Lisa has come backstage. She finally accuses Jobs of being a terrible parent, having read the TIME article from 1984. She lets him know how awful he’s been, and leaves. Pg. 170-175: Parking lot. Jobs follows Lisa out into the parking lot. He admits to having named the LISA computer after her, and he allows himself to start the presentation late (which he never does). He wants to read one of Lisa’s essays, and he promises her he’s going to put “a thousand songs in her pocket.” Pg. 175-177: Backstage. Lisa and Jobs go backstage, and we hear the song “Both Sides Now” as someone reads lyrics to Bob Dylan’s “The Times They Are A’Changin,” and intercut between Jobs getting ready backstage and all the characters we’ve met. Jobs tells Lisa that he remembers the painting she made on the original Mac, and then he goes on stage for the presentation of the iMac. Attachments: JOBS Breakdown.doc (38976 Bytes)",Private
"This ridiculously easy trick makes your PowerPoint a winner. Ten Secrets that Made Steve Jobs' Presentations the World's Best And How You Can Use Them to Astound Your Audience Genius. Legend. Visionary. These are but a few of the superlatives that have been used to describe the late, great Steve Jobs. But beyond his business acumen, the man behind Apple® computers and Pixar Animation Studios was perhaps the greatest keynote speaker of our time. There are more than 57,000 links to his presentations on YouTube. What made his presentations so amazing that people all over the world want to see them? More importantly, how can the rest of us learn from Steve to inspire our audiences the way he did? In his excellent book, The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs: How to Be Insanely Great in Front of Any Audience, Carmine Gallo takes us behind the scenes and offers Steve's ten secrets that you can use for presentations that will inform, engage and, yes, astound your audience. ""My presentation was supposed to knock your socks off. I guess I got carried away."" Buy SmartDraw now and save $100 or more for a limited time. Holy Smokes, Bullets Kill! (And Other Presentation Tips) Before planning your presentation, according to Carmine Gallo, it is critical to know the question that matters most to your audience: ""Why should I care?""1 You need to think about how to inspire your audience. Simply trying to sell them something doesn't cut it. As Carmine writes, ""Your widget doesn't inspire me. Show me how your widget improves my life, and you've won me over.""2 Here are Steve Jobs' ten secrets for insanely great presentations.3 Plan in analog. Brainstorm in advance of creating your presentation. You can use pen and paper, a whiteboard or, better yet, a mind map. DO NOT use PowerPoint®to create your presentation—it will be used only in the final step! (More on this later.) Create Twitter-friendly headlines. Describe your product or service in 140 characters or less. Preferably, a lot less. Steve introduced the MacBook Air® as simply, ""The world's thinnest notebook."" About the first-generation iPod®, he tweeted: ""It's one thousand songs in your pocket."" Introduce the villain. Steve saw a presentation as a three-act play that must tell a story, but what is a story without a hero and a villain? Before he introduced the famous 1984 ad to a group of Apple salespeople, he set the stage, casting ""Big Blue"" as Goliath. ""IBM wants it all,"" he warned, and defiantly asserted that only Apple stoodin its way. His dramatic moment sent the crowd into frenzy. While the villain doesn't have to be a competitor, it must be a common foe that your audience will want to join with you in rallying against. Your product is then revealed as the conquering hero. Create visual slides. As Carmine writes, ""Neuroscientists are finding that the best way to communicate information is through text and pictures, not text alone."" As for bullet points, Steve never, ever, used them and neither should you. Carmine has a section in his book titled, ""Bullets Kill"" that describes why you should avoid using PowerPoint to create your presentation. ""Think about what happens when you open PowerPoint. A blank-format slide appears that contains space for words—a title and subtitle. This presents a problem. There are very few words in a Steve Jobs presentation. Now think about the first thing you see in the drop-down menu under Format: Bullets & Numbering. This leads to the second problem. There are no bullet points in a Steve Jobs presentation. The software itself forces you to create a template that represents the exact opposite of what you need to speak like Steve!""4 Take a look at the following comparison of bullet-point slides compared to the same information, presented visually. Practice, a lot. Most people read their presentations off of their PowerPoint slides. This is why most presentations are boring. Steve treated every slide as piece of poetry and every presentation as a theatrical event. He wasn't a natural presenter; he worked very hard at it. Rehearse your presentation, toss the script and look at your audience. Practice at making it look effortless. Obey the ten-minute rule. It's a scientific fact that the brain gets tired after ten minutes. Steve's presentations typically lasted an hour and a half. He would break them up into short intervals of ten minutes or less by interspersing videos, demonstrations, or guest speakers. Don't let your audience get tired or you'll lose them. A great way to keep your audience's attention when presenting information is though sequencing, which builds the story within a visual one step at a time, making the information much easier to digest. Dress up your numbers. We often deal with large numbers or data that an audience can't comprehend without context. Breaking them down and presenting numbers visually can overcome this. Notice how much more effectively the chart below illustrates sales figures as opposed to a matrix of data. Reveal a 'holy smokes!' moment. Maya Angelou said, ""People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them fe el."" Steve Jobs always produced a memorable moment in a pre sentation. When he introduced the MacBook Air, he told his a udience that while everyone had seen manila envelopes floating around the office, what they had never seen was someone pulling a notebook computer out of one—which is precisely what he did. The audience went wild and images of that moment remain emblazoned in people's minds four years later. Sell dreams, not products. When it looked at the iPod, the world saw a music player. What Steve Jobs saw was a tool to enrich people's lives. Howard Schultz of Starbucks didn't have a passion to sell coffee; his vision was to create an experience: a 'third place' between home and work where people would want to gather. The dream met the customer's need and the product sales took care of itself. Have fun! When was the last time you saw someone enjoying giving a presentation? Steve Jobs had fun in every keynote. He made jokes at his own expense. While most people give presentations to deliver information, Steve always created an experience that his audience would enjoy and remember. Most importantly, he sold them on becoming a part of his dream, not his product.

It's a scientific fact that the brain gets tired after ten minutes. Steve's presentations typically lasted an hour and a half. He would break them up into short intervals of ten minutes or less by interspersing videos, demonstrations, or guest speakers. Don't let your audience get tired or you'll lose them.

"Re: Jobs biopic/Fincher Leak The Hollywood Reporter couldn't hold...story below broke a few minutes ago. The Hollywood Reporter: David Fincher in Early Talks to Direct Steve Jobs Film for Sony (Exclusive) by Tatiana Siegel Based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography, the film would reteam Fincher with ""Social Network"" writer Aaron Sorkin and producer Scott Rudin. David Fincher already has tackled one Silicon Valley billionaire in Mark Zuckerberg. Now, the Social Network director is poised to take on the late Steve Jobs for Sony. Fincher is in early talks to helm the untitled film based on Walter Isaacson’s best-selling biography of the Apple co-founder, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. If a deal comes together, the film would reunite the director with Oscar-winning Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin, who recently finished the adaptation, and the film's producer Scott Rudin. Like Zuckerberg, Jobs was a complicated visionary who became a polarizing figure. Under Jobs' watch, Apple revolutionized several business, including personal computers, music, computer-generated animation and mobile phones. In the process, he became known as one of the greatest innovators of his generation. At the same time, he was unapologetic about his difficult personality, was at one point ousted at Apple and was criticized for the harsh treatment of workers in China who assembled Apple products. Jobs' life already has inspired one big-screen feature: Open Road's 2011 film Jobs, starring Ashton Kutcher, which grossed just $35 million worldwide. But the Sorkin-penned project is considered a much more high-profile project due to the pedigree of those involved and the popularity of Isaacson's book, for which he obtained unrivaled access to Jobs during the last years of his life. Sony boarded the project in October 2011, just weeks after Jobs succumbed to pancreatic cancer. Sorkin began writing the script in 2012, though he also has been heavily involved in his HBO series The Newsroom. No actor is attached yet, though the chance to play Jobs for Fincher and Sorkin likely would pique the interest of many A-list stars. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak is participating in the film as a consultant. Fincher is a notoriously picky director who can go years between film projects. He last directed Sony’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which Rudin produced. Though the film was well received and earned more than $200 million worldwide, it never spawned a second and third chapter, as originally planned. He recently finished shooting the Fox/New Regency mystery Gone Girl, based on Gillian Flynn’s best-seller. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike star. Fincher also just launched season two of the critically acclaimed Netflix series House of Cards, which he executive produces. Fincher and Flynn also are reteaming on the HBO series Utopia. Fincher is repped by manager Joshua Donen and attorney Craig Jacobson. ----- Original Message ----- From: Pascal, Amy To: Belgrad, Doug Cc: Guerin, Jean; Cantillon, Elizabeth; Sipkins, Charles Sent: Wed Feb 26 07:38:18 2014 Subject: Re: Jobs biopic/Fincher Leak Michael....

"Re: fincher and jobs THR: David Fincher Out of Steve Jobs Movie in $10 Million Fee Fight (Exclusive) By Kim Masters April 14 2014 The director was negotiating with Sony to reteam with ""The Social Network"" writer Aaron Sorkin and producer Scott Rudin. Sony Pictures is looking to replace David Fincher as director of its highly anticipated Steve Jobs movie due to his aggressive demands for compensation and control, according to several sources. Fincher is said to be seeking a hefty $10 million up front in fees, as well as control over marketing, in negotiations with the studio. Sony allowed him considerable input into the marketing of the 2011 film The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, including honoring his request to use the tagline “The Feel Bad Movie of Christmas” in its campaign. A source says Fincher also had the studio create metal, razor-blade-shaped one-sheet materials for the film that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce but were not suitable for display in theaters. Sony declined to comment. Fincher reps did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A source with ties to the studio says Fincher potentially could re-enter negotiations but that the fee he is seeking is “ridiculous,” adding, “You’re not doing Transformers here. You’re not doing Captain America. This is quality — it’s not screaming commerciality. He should be rewarded in success but not up front.” The Jobs movie, based on Walter Isaacson's acclaimed bestselling biography Steve Jobs, would have reunited the team behind The Social Network, including producer Scott Rudin, writer Aaron Sorkin and Fincher. That film grossed $225 million worldwide in 2010 and scored Sorkin a best adapted screenplay Oscar. Fincher had wanted Christian Bale to star in the Jobs film, though the actor is not attached to the project. The negotiation comes at a key time for Sony, which is attempting to enforce greater fiscal responsibility after a lackluster summer 2013 that included such disappointments as After Earth and White House Down. The studio previously had been known for spending more freely than its rivals. On Apr 14, 2014, at 1:44 PM, Scott Rudin <sr@scottrudinproductions.com> wrote: I don’t care what they do.

"Re: fincher and jobs Variety: David Fincher Passes on Sony’s Steve Jobs Biopic By Justin Kroll April 14, 2014 After showing early interest in the project, sources tell Variety that David Fincher will not direct “Jobs,” Sony’s biopic on Steve Jobs. Fincher was never officially attached to the project, which would have reteamed him with “The Social Network” scribe Aaron Sorkin and producer Scott Rudin, but had met with Sony after the studio tapped him as its top choice to direct the pic. At that point, insiders said Fincher was weighing a handful of other projects and had never fully committed to directing. The film is based on the Walter Isaacson biography “Steve Jobs,” to which Sony acquired the rights following the Apple mogul’s death in 2011. Sorkin finished the script earlier this year and has said that it is divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of the company’s infamous product launches. Guymon Casady and Mark Gordon are also on board as producers. Fincher is currently in post-production on the Fox adaptation of Gillian Flynn’s popular “Gone Girl” novel.

It's perfect. I will say it was a constant battle for me between movie lover and my actual job of marketer... but it's truly masterful. Let's take the obvious off the table here - there are marketing liabilities to this script. It's long, it's claustrophobic, it's talky, it could be a play, it risks being all one medium close up, it's periody.Doesn't matter. We release this over Christmas, let the award buzz and word of mouth buoy it to where it needs to go. While there are a bunch of reasons to try to revise it with some daytime exteriors, some establishing shots etc, it would topple the elegant house-of-cards-ness of it (I may argue the other way for marketing purposes when trying to put stock shots in tv spots etc but I get it and I love it).It's a mediation on Jobs himself. It's one of his early computers - closed end to end. It's insistent upon itself, it's relentless. I kept begging for someone to walk outside, for some daylight, for an opening. But Sorkin is so brilliant with the structure. Of course, at the film's end he gives you that break into the parking lot. A convenient door to a different world. Just when Jobs lets up, the script finally breathes for the first time. It's really spectacular. All obvious stuff but I'm a sucker for layered, thoughtful filmmaking. Sure it's got a marketing issues but I think it also has the panacea for those - I believe it will be brilliant. I do think the one thing that can hinder that is if it's too long. I think people will endure anything for quality but if it's 3 hours we'll lose out. But that's all way down the road.It has to be able to be realized at a decent number right? Still DiCaprio and Danny Boyle? That's the other thing - this can't be without a star playing Jobs and can't be done by just anyone. Obviously. The script is a prefect 10 but in the wrong hands it grosses mid 30's. But it sounds like it's going with the full package and while tricky - people deserve this kind of movie and in some weird way we have a responsibility to take these kinds of risks. Not to make it seem like we're saving lives - but I actually think that. This is the kind of film that makes me thankful for movies and they're few and far between these days.Thank you for sharing. It's really the kind of thing that gets in you and stays with you for days. It's exciting.Best,Mike",Private

Jennifer Aniston has been courted for the female lead. --David Fincher is in early talks to direct the untitled Steve Jobs movie for Sony, written by Aaron Sorkin and produced by Scott Rudin. Sorkin has publicly said the Jobs biopic will be divided into three long scenes, each taking place backstage before one of Apple’s infamous product launches. “The first one being the Mac,”, “The second one being NeXT, after he had left Apple. And the third one being the iPod.” The film is based on the Walter Isaacson biography “Steve Jobs,” to which Sony acquired the rights following Job’s death in 2011….. the only authorized biography that Jobs would give his blessing to prior to his death. --“Son of God” was the leading ticket seller on both Fandango and Movietickets.com as of Wednesday, with roughly 30 percent of overall sales. It’s strong on social media, especially Facebook, where its mentions are double those of “Noah” according to BoxOffice.com. “It feels like around $12 million, maybe $15 million,” said Chris Aronson. “But honestly, because of the faith-based element, we just don’t know, so it wouldn’t shock me if it did $25 million.” Mark Burnett told the Wrap on Wednesday, “This movie is going to be seen by a billion people over the next three or four years, so a big opening would be great, but this is very much a long-term proposition.” --Buzz Escalates for 'Godzilla' Following New Trailer: Godzilla was responsible for generating 50,217 tweets Tuesday. That handily topped the next closest movie (Divergent, 25,890 tweets) for the day and represents a similar amount of Twitter activity as seen by Guardians of the Galaxy when its first trailer debuted last week. As of Wednesday morning, Twitter discussion still more than doubles that of its closest competition. On Facebook, Godzilla added over 35,000 new fans within 24 hours of the new trailer's launch. Nearly 86 percent of its 458,767 fans (as of early Wednesday morning) have joined since December 10. -- Sandra Bullock looks set to earn her biggest paycheck to date for Gravity, with studio sources saying she will make at least $70 million when all revenue streams are factored in. Bullock's deal with Warner Bros. calls for her to earn $20 million upfront against 15 percent of first-dollar gross. That means once her advance is covered, she will collect 15 percent of the studio's film rentals. Gravity is expected to cross the $750 million mark. --The National School Boards Association (NSBA) is partnering with New Regency, Penguin Books and the filmmakers to distribute copies of the film, book and study guide “12 Years a Slave” to America’s public high schools. The initiative, coordinated by TV host Montel Williams, will start to distribute “12 Years a Slave” nationwide in September 2014 in concert with the new school year. It is modeled against an initiative Williams launched that led to distribution by “The Montel Williams Show” of copies of the Civil War film “Glory” to public high schools. --Variety reports that while the deal is not yet finalized, Girls star Adam Driver will play the lead villain in Disney’s Star Wars: Episode VII directed by J.J.

I feel awful that you feel disrespected by me in any way on 1000 Splendid Suns. I want to make that right. I really do. I have such admiration for you and you make all the best films that I want to be involved with, it doesn't make sense for us to be at odds with each other. I want to work with you. On 1000 Splendid Suns, on Jobs, and hopefully many others. I truly believe we can resolve this. And I would love to explain the reason why the Steve Jobs project is so important to me too. Steve Jobs was and always will be an important part of my family. He was my father's best friend, he was the witness at his wedding, he is the only person my father has ever truly admired. So this is also incredibly personal for me. It would be a great joy to be a part of shepherding his story. I'm not looking to infringe on your territory. I'm not power hungry or an ego maniac. I just love films and this film in particular. I'd love the opportunity to be a part of it and I want to see how you work. No bullshit, I've looked up to you forever, since as long as I can remember. I hope this you well. Sincerely and humbly, Megan Sent from my iPhone. Where in the world is Carmen SanDiego?",Private
"Re: I'm staying on Gareth, worst case I'll get a blind from him even if he abandons Golgo or Sammy never closes with him. I'll suss out scheduling on Steve Knight script for intl release. On LHOP I still think we should provide cut ideas after we get script and budget so we can turn generalities into specifics and know what we are talking about in detail based on new draft and budget, otherwise Rudin will poke holes. Once Yorn gets back to us on Leo we can proceed on all fronts. I agree our party line should be 50, with Leo and all California shoot and let them figure it out, Danny is efficient. We only have 7 productions plus Bond for 2015 release, but no room for more? Pinning down 16 and 17 this week, will include tentpoles through 18 If we are besotted with smallish movies we need to have an honest talk about why our term deals and execs are letting our needs go unanswered. Or reLly decide once and for all if they are unanswered. Let's list the projects that we think can do a minimum of 300 to 500 ww and up. Let's list all our projects by likely ww gross to see how many small ones we think we have. We will have a script on Grey Man from the Russos before they start prepping cap 3, maybe by end of summer or start of fall, we can have movie for 2016. Same for Winters knight, just got rewrite. I have new budget for Inferno that may make 90 workable. Ready to pin down this week for 2015 start with Ron. I think we have what we need to make atl proposal. Trying to pin down Hugh Jackman on ARW, have model at 40. Still trying to convince gene and lee to take on GB3 rewrite, kadin and I wining and dining them tomorrow night. Just got watch dogs treatment. When can we hire new executives? I'm so confused about this? Hannah and I have two or three people standing by but last time we spoke you said we can only hire a ce, but also getting message change needs to happen fast but have no sense of timing on openings. Feels mixed messaged, help! We are starting to negotiate for Greengrass treatment, and Paul wants a writer to do 1984 for him, Rudin trying to settle with imagine and Yorns. Bloodshot comes in to producers at end of this month. Gran Turismo is in to producers. I do now need you to read Epsilon. I'll explain why tomorrow.

We ought to feel that he combined art and technology and emotion and technology and had this deep understanding of human need – and THAT is what he did. His talent and artistry were his redemption. -Hit harder the idea of Steve’s RESILIENCE – he continually refuses to acknowledge defeat. His particular genius was his unbelievable drive. Specifically, NExT should feel like a defeat and that he snatched success from the jaws of FAILURE. And the iMac’s success in Act 3 should not me a foregone conclusion at the time of the launch. There should be some uncertainty so when we get to Joanna giving Steve the projections it lands. Finally, he drove people into the ground but we need to make clear that he also drove them TO BE GREAT. -Don’t want to invent a Rosebud moment that doesn’t seem true but if there is a Rosebud that actually existed... -The idea that the product is JOBS.

Jillian Bell, Keegan Michael Key and Kate McKinnon all cast in smaller roles. Recording starts in July. Next screening is planned for the end of the summer but I'm going to ask John to show it to us sooner even if it's not all three acts. The BFG has been dated July 1st so John has been talking to Jeff and Dwight about looking for an earlier date. - I am coming to the Hotel T scrng Thursday. - working to lock down a date for our next Sausage Party screening probably end of July before you leave on vacation.

Some answers to your questions below: - super exciting re: Brad and the Steve Knight project. We can factor into our slate conversation on Monday. Mike and I have a meeting with the staff Monday morning to review our upcoming slate so we'll have fully updated news for you. - I think we should see what kind of cast Will can attract for Vitus and then decide if we want to do it and whether it lives at Columbia/TriStar or Bersch. - Barbie first draft this week so script by the end of the summer is reasonable. - Chris Hemsworth apparently loves the script we've been developing for him - Man Behind The Curtain. We're addressing his and our notes now. New draft in a few weeks and will share with you then. (fyi - he hasn't committed his spring slot yet). - Masters Of The Universe in two weeks. Hoping Jeff Wadlow delivers a version of the movie we're all excited about. - My on-going communication with the Narnia estate continues to be very positive. Mark is getting David Magee's first draft in the next week or so and it's my hope they will want to share it with us before the end of the summer. - 5th Wave screen tests happening this weekend. I just heard from J and Chloe that they think we have great choices for Evan! We'll see the tests this week. Dylan tests tomorrow and we're confident either he or Nick Robinson are our Ben Parish. Would love to go over the other cast options on Monday to follow-up on the emails I sent last week. Great conversations with the publishers and publicity last week. Chloe's publicity schedule for Equalizer has been factored into our schedule for 5th Wave. Ange and I reading the new draft this weekend and will report back... - we have a rough schedule for Bad Teacher 2 that gets us a June 2015 release if we want it. Waiting for the financial model and will then share. Our schedule takes into consideration Cameron's dates for Annie publicity. - Mike Marshall is in the cone of silence re: Chris and Phil. He and Jason spoke Thursday to start the conversation about their deal. - Mike and I are narrowing down our picks for new execs. - Jonah, Channing, Neal, Chris and Phil all blessed making a deal with Rodney Rothman for 23JS. That's in process. We're also working on a list of writers for the spin-off female version. - we don't have a writer on Monkeys. Got passes from Pam Brady, Dan Sterling, Simon Rich, Eisenberg & Stupnitsky and others. Out to a new group. Will keep you updated. - Off The Wall script is coming to you very soon. Probably in a week or so. I organized a meeting with Walter and Bob last week which went really well. I think we have to think of this as an animated movie even though the plan is to shoot live action environments.

"Re: answers to your questions Hi - hope you had a good flight. Some answers to your questions below: - super exciting re: Brad and the Steve Knight project. We can factor into our slate conversation on Monday. Mike and I have a meeting with the staff Monday morning to review our upcoming slate so we'll have fully updated news for you. - I think we should see what kind of cast Will can attract for Vitus and then decide if we want to do it and whether it lives at Columbia/TriStar or Bersch. - Barbie first draft this week so script by the end of the summer is reasonable. - Chris Hemsworth apparently loves the script we've been developing for him - Man Behind The Curtain. We're addressing his and our notes now. New draft in a few weeks and will share with you then. (fyi - he hasn't committed his spring slot yet). - Masters Of The Universe in two weeks. Hoping Jeff Wadlow delivers a version of the movie we're all excited about. - My on-going communication with the Narnia estate continues to be very positive. Mark is getting David Magee's first draft in the next week or so and it's my hope they will want to share it with us before the end of the summer. - 5th Wave screen tests happening this weekend. I just heard from J and Chloe that they think we have great choices for Evan! We'll see the tests this week. Dylan tests tomorrow and we're confident either he or Nick Robinson are our Ben Parish. Would love to go over the other cast options on Monday to follow-up on the emails I sent last week. Great conversations with the publishers and publicity last week. Chloe's publicity schedule for Equalizer has been factored into our schedule for 5th Wave. Ange and I reading the new draft this weekend and will report back... - we have a rough schedule for Bad Teacher 2 that gets us a June 2015 release if we want it. Waiting for the financial model and will then share. Our schedule takes into consideration Cameron's dates for Annie publicity. - Mike Marshall is in the cone of silence re: Chris and Phil. He and Jason spoke Thursday to start the conversation about their deal. - Mike and I are narrowing down our picks for new execs. - Jonah, Channing, Neal, Chris and Phil all blessed making a deal with Rodney Rothman for 23JS. That's in process. We're also working on a list of writers for the spin-off female version. - we don't have a writer on Monkeys. Got passes from Pam Brady, Dan Sterling, Simon Rich, Eisenberg & Stupnitsky and others. Out to a new group. Will keep you updated. - Off The Wall script is coming to you very soon. Probably in a week or so. I organized a meeting with Walter and Bob last week which went really well. I think we have to think of this as an animated movie even though the plan is to shoot live action environments. Walter and I both agree that in addition to addressing script notes our hope is to do some visual development and r&d with ImageWorks. Bob wants to help us do this inexpensively. - the team presented their preliminary findings from their studio analysis to Mike and I on Wednesday. Everyone needs to dig a little deeper but it was already interesting. We're working on organizing all the data and drawing the relevant conclusions.

Got passes from Pam Brady, Dan Sterling, Simon Rich, Eisenberg & Stupnitsky and others. Out to a new group. Will keep you updated. - Off The Wall script is coming to you very soon. Probably in a week or so. I organized a meeting with Walter and Bob last week which went really well. I think we have to think of this as an animated movie even though the plan is to shoot live action environments. Walter and I both agree that in addition to addressing script notes our hope is to do some visual development and r&d with ImageWorks. Bob wants to help us do this inexpensively. - the team presented their preliminary findings from their studio analysis to Mike and I on Wednesday. Everyone needs to dig a little deeper but it was already interesting. We're working on organizing all the data and drawing the relevant conclusions.

Some answers to your questions below: - super exciting re: Brad and the Steve Knight project. We can factor into our slate conversation on Monday. Mike and I have a meeting with the staff Monday morning to review our upcoming slate so we'll have fully updated news for you. - I think we should see what kind of cast Will can attract for Vitus and then decide if we want to do it and whether it lives at Columbia/TriStar or Bersch. - Barbie first draft this week so script by the end of the summer is reasonable. - Chris Hemsworth apparently loves the script we've been developing for him - Man Behind The Curtain. We're addressing his and our notes now. New draft in a few weeks and will share with you then. (fyi - he hasn't committed his spring slot yet). - Masters Of The Universe in two weeks. Hoping Jeff Wadlow delivers a version of the movie we're all excited about. - My on-going communication with the Narnia estate continues to be very positive. Mark is getting David Magee's first draft in the next week or so and it's my hope they will want to share it with us before the end of the summer. - 5th Wave screen tests happening this weekend. I just heard from J and Chloe that they think we have great choices for Evan! We'll see the tests this week. Dylan tests tomorrow and we're confident either he or Nick Robinson are our Ben Parish. Would love to go over the other cast options on Monday to follow-up on the emails I sent last week. Great conversations with the publishers and publicity last week. Chloe's publicity schedule for Equalizer has been factored into our schedule for 5th Wave. Ange and I reading the new draft this weekend and will report back... - we have a rough schedule for Bad Teacher 2 that gets us a June 2015 release if we want it. Waiting for the financial model and will then share. Our schedule takes into consideration Cameron's dates for Annie publicity. - Mike Marshall is in the cone of silence re: Chris and Phil. He and Jason spoke Thursday to start the conversation about their deal. - Mike and I are narrowing down our picks for new execs. - Jonah, Channing, Neal, Chris and Phil all blessed making a deal with Rodney Rothman for 23JS.

I feel awful that you feel disrespected by me in any way on 1000 Splendid Suns. I want to make that right. I really do. I have such admiration for you and you make all the best films that I want to be involved with, it doesn't make sense for us to be at odds with each other. I want to work with you. On 1000 Splendid Suns, on Jobs, and hopefully many others. I truly believe we can resolve this. And I would love to explain the reason why the Steve Jobs project is so important to me too. Steve Jobs was and always will be an important part of my family. He was my father's best friend, he was the witness at his wedding, he is the only person my father has ever truly admired. So this is also incredibly personal for me. It would be a great joy to be a part of shepherding his story. I'm not looking to infringe on your territory. I'm not power hungry or an ego maniac. I just love films and this film in particular. I'd love the opportunity to be a part of it and I want to see how you work. No bullshit, I've looked up to you forever, since as long as I can remember. I hope this you well. Sincerely and humbly, Megan Sent from my iPhone. Where in the world is Carmen SanDiego?",Private

"Re: answers to your questions Fabulous Hanna So appreciated Sent from my Sony Xperia Z2 On Jun 22, 2014, at 12:04 AM, ""Minghella, Hannah"" <Hannah_Minghella@spe.sony.com> wrote: Hi - hope you had a good flight. Some answers to your questions below: - super exciting re: Brad and the Steve Knight project. We can factor into our slate conversation on Monday. Mike and I have a meeting with the staff Monday morning to review our upcoming slate so we'll have fully updated news for you. - I think we should see what kind of cast Will can attract for Vitus and then decide if we want to do it and whether it lives at Columbia/TriStar or Bersch. - Barbie first draft this week so script by the end of the summer is reasonable. - Chris Hemsworth apparently loves the script we've been developing for him - Man Behind The Curtain. We're addressing his and our notes now. New draft in a few weeks and will share with you then. (fyi - he hasn't committed his spring slot yet). - Masters Of The Universe in two weeks. Hoping Jeff Wadlow delivers a version of the movie we're all excited about. - My on-going communication with the Narnia estate continues to be very positive. Mark is getting David Magee's first draft in the next week or so and it's my hope they will want to share it with us before the end of the summer. - 5th Wave screen tests happening this weekend. I just heard from J and Chloe that they think we have great choices for Evan! We'll see the tests this week. Dylan tests tomorrow and we're confident either he or Nick Robinson are our Ben Parish. Would love to go over the other cast options on Monday to follow-up on the emails I sent last week. Great conversations with the publishers and publicity last week. Chloe's publicity schedule for Equalizer has been factored into our schedule for 5th Wave. Ange and I reading the new draft this weekend and will report back... - we have a rough schedule for Bad Teacher 2 that gets us a June 2015 release if we want it. Waiting for the financial model and will then share. Our schedule takes into consideration Cameron's dates for Annie publicity. - Mike Marshall is in the cone of silence re: Chris and Phil. He and Jason spoke Thursday to start the conversation about their deal. - Mike and I are narrowing down our picks for new execs. - Jonah, Channing, Neal, Chris and Phil all blessed making a deal with Rodney Rothman for 23JS. That's in process. We're also working on a list of writers for the spin-off female version. - we don't have a writer on Monkeys. Got passes from Pam Brady, Dan Sterling, Simon Rich, Eisenberg & Stupnitsky and others. Out to a new group. Will keep you updated. - Off The Wall script is coming to you very soon. Probably in a week or so. I organized a meeting with Walter and Bob last week which went really well. I think we have to think of this as an animated movie even though the plan is to shoot live action environments. Walter and I both agree that in addition to addressing script notes our hope is to do some visual development and r&d with ImageWorks. Bob wants to help us do this inexpensively. - the team presented their preliminary findings from their studio analysis to Mike and I on Wednesday. Everyone needs to dig a little deeper but it was already interesting. We're working on organizing all the data and drawing the relevant conclusions. Okay, I think that's everything for now... ps - happy to read Revenant. Are you sending to us?

Russell & Eric Singer on Writing American Hustle ""I See the Women as a Nuclear Resource"" David O. Russell earned his first Best Original Screenplay nomination, along with Eric Singer, for writing American Hustle. Ben Affleck was first attached to direct after Singer’s 2010 draft landed on that year’s Black List. That arrangement never came to fruition, and once Russell came aboard, “it all came together very quickly,” says Singer, who along with Russell, spoke to SSN about writing American Hustle.

Ewing’s death dominated both the plot and the emotional pitch of the end of the second season of the new Dallas; the mystery surrounding his untimely demise was resolved in the finale. The third-season premiere picks up only 12 hours after the finale, while many of Southfork’s shifting relationships and individual characters’ role reversals may stem from grief.

"Business Owner's Informational Newsletter Issue: # 170 August 2014 10 Small Things You Can Do Every Day to Get Smarter by Jessica Stillman Intelligence is a work in progress. Maximize yours with these simple habits. You might be under the impression that intelligence is a fixed quantity set when you are young and unchanging thereafter. But research shows that you're wrong. How we approach situations and the things we do to feed our brains can significantly improve our mental horsepower.That could mean going back to school or fillingng your bookshelves (or e-reader) with thick tomes on deep subjects, but getting smarter doesn't necessarily mean a huge commitment of time and energy, according to a recent thread on question-and-answer site Quora.When a questioner keen on self-improvement asked the community, ""What would you do to be a little smarter every single day?"" lots of readers--including dedicated meditators, techies, and entrepreneurs--weighed in with useful suggestions. Which of these 10 ideas can you fit into your daily routine?1. Be smarter about your online time. Every online break doesn't have to be about checking social networks and fulfilling your daily ration of cute animal pics. The Web is also full of great learning resources, such as online courses, intriguing TED talks, and vocabulary-building tools. Replace a few minutes of skateboarding dogs with something more mentally nourishing, suggest several responders.2. Write down what you learn.It doesn't have to be pretty or long, but taking a few minutes each day to reflect in writing about what you learned is sure to boost your brainpower. ""Write 400 words a day on things that you learned,"" suggests yoga teacher Claudia Azula Altucher. Mike Xie, a research associate at Bayside Biosciences, agrees: ""Write about what you've learned.""

Click Here For More Details The Biggest Thing Standing Between You and Success by Paul B. Brown Hint: It's not money or time--even though you could probably use more of both.Henry Ford got it absolutely right when he said, ""Whether you believe you can, or you believe you can't, you're right.""There are countless things required to start a successful company: discovering the market need; coming up with a product or service that fills that need; communicating successfully that you have the solution that people have been searching for. You could go on for quite a long time describing what you must do to create a lasting enterprise.And I would not spend a single minute debating with you that some things on whatever list you come up with are not important.They all probably are.But the biggest reason people fail is that they never try.As basketball and hockey players have said forever: ""You miss 100 percent of the shots that you never take.""People can be extremely risk averse and the idea of a venture not working out can scare them to the point where they never get underway. They keep thinking about the idea or maybe doing more and more research, and so they never pull the trigger.Or they don't start because their advisers (or spouses) are very conservative and keep pointing out reasons why they should delay, and so they wait and think and refine and tweak and refine some more.Or they take too long to test the market, putting off actually beginning to the point where the competition has passed them by.Or they think that just one more bit of market research or one more phone call will guarantee success.All these situations are sad.As I have written about before, if you think you have a good idea, get into the marketplace as quickly as you can, using as little money as possible. Take a small step toward your goals, and see what happens.Maybe you find out right away you have a hit on your hands. (It does happen occasionally.)Maybe--and this is much more likely--you will learn that the market wants you to fiddle a bit with what you have. (To play with the clichÃ©d example, people aren't crazy about coming by your lemonade stand to get a drink every time they are thirsty, but if you could somehow figure out a way to get your lemonade into the break room at work, they would be more than willing to give you a six-month contract.)And if your idea doesn't work in any form, you aren't out very much, since you kept the cost of your initial small step toward your goal to a minimum. That means you will have the resources to try again.But if you don't try, you'll never know.That's why I truly believe that the biggest thing standing between you and success...is you. How to Overcome Your Fears and Move Your Business Forwardby Christopher Hann Tom Bandy knows all about the fears of the entrepreneur. Having built two companies from the ground up, he has experienced the fear of spending investors' money and the fear of making payroll. Worse, he has known the dread of having to fire an employee. But he also knows he's not alone. ""Every entrepreneur talks about waking up at 3 o'clock in the morning with the thing that scares him to death,"" he says. Let's be clear: Fear can be helpful, even necessary. Fear is the mind's way of telling us that danger -- or, at least, a bumpy road -- lurks ahead. But whether justified or not, fear can wreak havoc on the entrepreneurial life. It can thwart imagination and choke ambition. At its most devious, it can make every obstacle seem insurmountable. Consider the German proverb: ""Fear makes the wolf bigger than he is.""The trick, of course, is learning to overcome our fear so that we see the wolf as, well, just a wolf. It's not easy. Fear has been etched into our DNA since the first cave man got too close to his campfire. The late horror and fantasy author H.P. Lovecraft called fear ""the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind."" Yet entrepreneurs have no real options--no good ones, anyway--but to conquer their fears. If you want to take that bold step that could make your company thrive, you'll need to stare down the demons that have been holding you back.""You're the head honcho,"" says Linda Sapadin, a Valley Stream, N.Y.-based psychologist and author of Master Your Fears: How to Triumph Over Your Worries and Get On With Your Life, ""so you really need to be able to get beyond the fear in order to make your business happen.""Bandy founded his software consulting and web design firm, BandyWorks, in 2005 in Petersburg, Va. (His wife, Holly Reider Bandy, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, is chief administrative officer.) He'd been there before. Back in the 1980s, fresh out of the University of Virginia, he started a company that developed database performance tools. After 16 years, an internal debate over the firm's direction resulted in a struggle for control, a struggle that Bandy lost. ""For me, I guess, fear is mostly associated with failure,"" he says. ""One of my fears is I'll grow weary of overcoming obstacles. That really is the definition of entrepreneurship to me, that persistence.To Read More... We NEED Your Assistance Yes, that's right.

Call us for a confidential conversation. WE GLADLY PAY REFERRAL FEES!!!!! How do I make my business different from others? by Michael Gerber One of the most important aspects of making a business is learning how to differentiate. To understand process, the way results are produced, it is primarily most important to understand outcomes - the actual results you would prefer to produce. These outcomes exist within every component of your company's process, from the very first interaction with a prospective client, all along the value chain, to the last outcome you are determined to produce. Remember: how you do it is what differentiates your company from everyone else in your industry. You succeed, or you don't. But, success is only measured by the impact it has on your customer, the emotional impact, the visual impact, the functional impact. An impact your customer has never experienced before. Your job is to design your company so that it has that impact, that successful emotional experience, that unanticipated result. Differentiation, in layman's terms, is key. To attain a measure of differentiation that really works, how you do what you do is just as important, and in many cases more so, than the actual deliverable it produces. I know that sounds bizarre on the face of it, but think on it. Imagine your first meeting with a potential client, where your sales guy, or your proposal expert, is to sit down with your prospective client to scope out what they wants. Imagine that you bring a notepad, to take notes on. Or, perhaps, if you're a true sophisticated gentleman, your laptop. (Just play along with me here; I know that what I'm about to posit would never happen in your company, but it does happen to most people in your business.) Imagine the pad of paper is like one your child might buy for school, lined pages, spiral notebook, inexpensive, nothing to write home about. Or, imagine that your laptop doesn't have wireless, or maybe it does, but you failed to ask your client whether their home is configured for wireless, and, unfortunately, it isn't. To sum up, at the very outset of your interaction with a prospect you lost the opportunity to position your company in a way that establishes your authority. Your distinction. Your presence. Your influence. Your difference. Then the question is, how do you establish your authority? Automatically, without hesitation, so that your prospective client thinks, automatically, without question, ""Oh wow! These guys have really got their *$%& together!"" Every single step you take in your business process must be thought of like this. That's right, every single one. That's what it means when we say working ON your business, rather to simply working IN it. The most competitive companies do this without exception. Everyone else doesn't. Everyone else simply works IN their business, doing it, always thinking that it's the price, Jerry, it's the price. We've got to get the price lower to get more business, when in fact, despite what you may think, it is not the price, never has been. The price only becomes significant when differentiation doesn't exist. So, function does trump form. Every time. The way your handle functions, how it processes itself, is what makes your company unique, just as Steve Jobs did at Apple. Take a look at Apple, the most valuable company on the face of the planet. How on earth did Jobs do that? In exactly the way I'm describing to you here. To accomplish that noble objective you have to go to work ON your company, as opposed to working IN it. Just like Steve Jobs did at Apple. Step by step by purposed, deliberate, highly differentiated step. When we think methodically, we think in two ways: over time, and in time. By 'over time', I mean that step-by-step process of completing an goal. A process is, after all, a system happening over time, each step is a system in itself, which is what I mean when I say, 'in time'. A white pad of paper is a system 'in time'. What you do with that white pad of paper happens 'over time'. In that respect, a script you use when positioning your company is a system 'over time' - which is a process through which identifiable objectives are completed, benchmark by benchmark. A benchmark is an objective, or outcome, with luck reached as you utilize the script. For example, Benchmark One in a sales script, might be the agreement attained with your prospective client that by the time the script is done, the both of you will come to agreement about the scope of the assignment ahead. As you advance in the process, other objectives or benchmarks, or outcomes, will be fulfilled. Marketing Strategies What are those objectives, those benchmarks? What choices does your prospective client need to make, in order for the impact you wish to have on him or her to be seen, felt, experienced?

"BLOOMBERG: Sony Studio Eliminates Jobs as Hirai Starts Pledged Cost Cutting BLOOMBERG: Sony Studio Eliminates Jobs as Hirai Starts Pledged Cost Cutting By Andy Fixmer Jan. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Sony Corp.’s Hollywood film studio began cutting jobs, including its head of technology, as the unit moves forward with $250 million in expense reductions pledged by Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai. Chris Cookson, president of Sony Pictures Technologies, was among those let go, Charles Sipkins, a spokesman for the studio, said in an e-mailed statement today. He didn’t provide details on the number of jobs cut. “As part of the company’s previously announced efforts to evolve its operations, Sony Pictures Entertainment is absorbing the functions of Sony Pictures Technologies into various core businesses,” Sipkins said. The move is the among the first of $250 million in cuts promised by Hirai in November, part of a plan to boost profit and keep full ownership of the movie, TV and music businesses. Sony Pictures folded the technology functions into its business groups to “accelerate creative and technological innovation,” the company said. Sony is also reducing the number of films from Columbia Pictures, shifting investment to television production and media networks, and identifying more savings, the company told investors in November at its Culver City, California, film studio.",Private

EXPERT ANALYSIS FCC's 1st Data Security Action Raises Concerns The Federal Communications Commission's first major case involving data security introduces a potential overlap with the Federal Trade Commission’s jurisdiction — and the risk of dual, and even conflicting, regulation, say Howard Waltzman and Lei Shen of Mayer Brown LLP. 4 Paths To Faster Patent Prosecution At The USPTO The delay at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office continues to be quite long, but fortunately the USPTO offers four options that allow most every patent applicant to significantly advance the pace of patent prosecution. While each of these programs has specific requirements for entry, those requirements are within the control of the applicant, say Rory Pheiffer and Lauren Ingegneri of Nutter McClennen & Fish LLP. LEGAL INDUSTRY Law360 Names Most Feared Plaintiffs Firms Of 2014 They have given the U.S. Department of Justice a run for its money in extracting billion-dollar accords from big banks. They have won jaw-dropping settlements and jury verdicts against drugmakers over the hidden harms of pharmaceuticals. And they have put the clamps on monopolistic practices that hurt small businesses everywhere. They are Law360’s Most Feared Plaintiffs Firms of 2014. 3 Keys To Winning The Hearts Of GCs When it comes to turning the heads of corporate clients, law firms are facing increasingly stiff competition as companies work to trim their legal budgets and reduce their reliance on outside counsel. Here, in-house attorneys at three companies share insight on how to stand out from the crowd. GCs Outsource Little Stuff, But Leave Big Rewards For Firms Corporations' push of mundane legal work toward cheaper outsourcing options may cut into firms' billable hours but will ultimately benefit them by freeing up more money for higher-rate matters, the legal head at Caterpillar Inc. said Wednesday at an in-house conference. GCs Look In Mirror To Save Cash And Keep Firms On Point Corporate law department heads should do internal reviews to unearth small problems that can have big impacts on budgets and help their law firms prioritize the client's big-picture business goals, a panel of general counsels said Wednesday. Ex-Dewey Attys Can't Shake $4.4M Clawback Claims A New York bankruptcy judge issued an opinion Wednesday that let the Dewey & Leboeuf LLP trustee proceed with $4.4 million clawback litigation connected to payments a group of former partners received when the doomed firm was allegedly insolvent. Titan Of The Plaintiffs Bar: David Sanford A New York Times obituary deserves part of the credit for spurring David Sanford of Sanford Heisler LLP to leave behind his years as a philosophy professor and set off on a different path marked by the pursuit of social justice in the courts as a self-described private attorney general. Minority Powerbrokers Q&A: K&L Gates' Paul Sweeney I’m not sure I have broken any ceiling. It is true that I manage our Los Angeles office and sit on the firm’s management and executive committees. But my achievements were preceded by legal giants such as Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston, who fought for the right for people like me to get a good education and a job wherever we had the ability to do the work, says Paul Sweeney Jr., a partner with K&L Gates LLP and former White House Fellow. Minority Powerbrokers Q&A: Marshall Gerstein's Rin-Laures I have been mistaken for a secretary or junior associate many times in my career. It is generally a temporary disadvantage, however. Being the only “different” person in a room full of white men can be an advantage too, because people remember you easily, says Dr. Li-Hsien Rin-Laures, a partner with Marshall Gerstein & Borun LLP and former general counsel of Hyseq Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Forgetting that it appears below that Judy doesn't even know how to spell Christine's name, it appears like she inadvertently copied Crystine on an email rejecting her proposed promotion (which Crystine likely didn't even know about). How does that happen? You both know how great Crystine is and how valuable to the SPENA organization she is. She is, for all intents and purposes a Networks employee. There is no reason at all that she reports to Manyee and Judy. I would really appreciate your help with George R in getting her reporting changed to Joan and in getting her promotion approved.

It is culturally insensitive. I am very disappointed. The intention behind the promotion proposal is to recognize her performance, nurture/groom a talent and not to de-motivate her. I believe we have just done everything to the contrary. Asia Networks is in a transformation process, Crystine is one of my change agents. While she remains committed and passionate about it, we need P&O management to be sensitive and not to de-motivate her. Thanks, HK From: Lim, Crystine Sent: Thursday, 8 May, 2014 9:37 AM To: Chow, Manyee Cc: Ang, Hui Keng Subject: FW: Christine Lim - Promotion - Please remove from ecomp Hi Manyee Thought that you should know that even though you guys are not considering any promotion for me, I trust that this should be an internal discussion. I’m disappointed on how this is being handled especially from our P&O folks, whom I always believe should be demonstrating more professional ethics in handling such matters. I got to know about my recommended promotion last night by chance when working on the file sent by Louie to update the job codes for our Networks Asia’s promotion and now, from Judy Bellamy’s email. I respect the decision that you made and believe you have your rationale and reasons that you will communicate to me in due course. But, I just felt the whole process and the way it is being handled is wrong! I’m sure you agree with me that being embroiled in such communication where it involves you will affect your thoughts and emotions on how you are being perceived. Nevertheless, with or without this promotion, I’m committed to continually support SPT Networks Asia to drive excellence and grow the business.

It’s been reported that Fincher will only join the project if Bale does. -- SPC has acquired North American and select overseas rights to James D. Cooper’s documentary “Lambert & Stamp,” which is centered on the pair of eponymous cinephiles in London during the 1960′s who set out to find a subject for their underground movie, leading them to discover, mentor and manage the iconic band that would become The Who. -- Korea pulled in $1.1M yesterday for NOAH …. for the highest opening day this year debuting on 730 screens. Paramount says Noah‘s opening gross is on par with Gravity; that film went on to a $29M+ total in the territory last year. Korea has a large Christian population. But, Korea also has a proclivity for action adventure movies with spectacular effects which tend to perform very well, a significant factor in opening there first. -- Cinedigm priced a secondary offering of its Class A common stock on Thursday, offering 10.2 million shares at $2.70 per share. The underwriter will have a 30-day option to purchase up to 1.53 million additional shares. Cinedigm plans to use the approximate $25.7 million in net proceeds for working capital, to fund potential future acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. The offering is expected to close on March 25. --Wanda Cinemas will install 780 sets of RealD 3D equipment in cinemas across China over the next three years. Last December, the company signed a deal with Imax to build 120 giant-format theaters in the country by 2021. The deal made Wanda Imax’s largest international exhibition partner. -- Ghost House Pictures has announced that it just hired ""Midnight Meat Train"" writer Jeff Buhler to put together a script for its upcoming ""The Grudge"" reboot, which will be produced by Sam Raimi. TRAILER REACTIONS: GET ON UP (Universal; Chadwick Boseman, Viola Davis, Dan Aykroyd): 8-1-14 Half the group sees a solid James Brown biopic, admiring the music and the casting choice of Chadwick Boseman as JB, whom a few liked in 42. The rest of the group, however, were not as won over by Boseman, calling him “gimmicky” and “uncomfortable” in this role. While mostly everyone here is a James Brown fan and shows interest in the controversial life of a music legend, the group overall is still not completely convinced this will be a great movie. PEANUTS (Fox): 11-6-15 A mostly positive reaction among the group, with many feeling nostalgic about the “timeless theme song and familiar characters.” While the majority were fans of the comic strip and feel this should translate well with a new generation of kids, there was some mild skepticism regarding the CGI/3D animation. Overall, the group finds this one “absolutely adorable.” THE MAZE RUNNER (FOX; Dylan O’Brien, Will Poulter, Kaya Scodelario): 9-19-14 Most of the group has grown tired of young adult books being spun into major motion pictures, and overall, this proved to be no exception. However, quite a few admitted to being “curious” about The Maze Runner while not being familiar with the book. Others referenced Hunger Games (a good thing) and Divergent (a bad thing) and one called this a likely unsuccessful attempt to “fill the void left by the Twilight franchise.” WEEKEND BOX OFFICE FORECAST from boxoffice.com: DIVERGENT (LG): $66M MUPPETS MOST WANTED (D): $25M THE GRAND",Private

What really distinguishes the movie is that it’s a live-action musical. In an era when musicals don’t have the appeal or generate the ticket sales they used to, the holidays remain a good time to have people break into song onscreen.

"Re: <no subject> We have a call with Scott tomorrow to go through the numbers, which home ent and mktg are still fine tuning. We can spend somewhere between 37.5 and 40 to back into threshold return. From the chain below, it sure seems that Aaron will do what's necessary and I think we just need to make an offer that David knows is the real box that he's got to fit into. And then he'll get real.

I left word for you at your office a few hours ago. The answer to your question is Mike. He emailed me yesterday and asked which I planned on writing first--Molly's Game, The Politician or Flash Boys. I wrote back that Flash Boys is research intensive and that I was also going to need time to come up with a plot as one doesn't exist in the book. Whereas Molly's Game is ready to be written right now and the only research I need is Molly. I told Mike that for that reason I'd be doing both at the same time and that in fact I'd already started the process. Mike wrote back that the studio would prefer I deliver Flash Boys before starting Molly's Game. I was then told by Mark Gordon that Sony was ""withdrawing its interest"" in Molly's Game. I wondered what happened between our lunch--where you showed a lot of enthusiasm for Molly's Game and in fact bristled at the idea of me even meeting with other studios--and yesterday. All of this is happening against the backdrop of the disintegration of Steve Jobs, which is completely blowing my mind. I asked Ari a question on the phone and he was unable to answer it so I'll ask you. If I turned in a terrific draft of Flash Boys, why would it have a better chance of getting made than Steve Jobs? The protagonist is Asian-American (actually Asian-Canadian) and there aren't any Asian movie stars. There's no precedent for stories about high frequency trading creating a stampede to the box office. Aren't you asking me to spend another year writing a movie you won't make and sign a contract you may or may not honor? Aaron",Private

"On Nov 14, 2014, at 3:16 PM, Pascal, Amy wrote:WHO SAID THAT?I left word for you at your office a few hours ago. The answer to your question is Mike. He emailed me yesterday and asked which I planned on writing first--Molly's Game, The Politician or Flash Boys. I wrote back that Flash Boys is research intensive and that I was also going to need time to come up with a plot as one doesn't exist in the book. Whereas Molly's Game is ready to be written right now and the only research I need is Molly. I told Mike that for that reason I'd be doing both at the same time and that in fact I'd already started the process. Mike wrote back that the studio would prefer I deliver Flash Boys before starting Molly's Game. I was then told by Mark Gordon that Sony was ""withdrawing its interest"" in Molly's Game. I wondered what happened between our lunch--where you showed a lot of enthusiasm for Molly's Game and in fact bristled at the idea of me even meeting with other studios--and yesterday. All of this is happening against the backdrop of the disintegration of Steve Jobs, which is completely blowing my mind. I asked Ari a question on the phone and he was unable to answer it so I'll ask you. If I turned in a terrific draft of Flash Boys, why would it have a better chance of getting made than Steve Jobs? The protagonist is Asian-American (actually Asian-Canadian) and there aren't any Asian movie stars. There's no precedent for stories about high frequency trading creating a stampede to the box office. Aren't you asking me to spend another year writing a movie you won't make and sign a contract you may or may not honor?Aaron",Private

"More “hands on” from Orrick. I had asked whether Plaintiff could do this without serving the complaint. From: Goldstein, David M. [mailto:dgoldstein@orrick.com] Sent: Tuesday, September 16, 2014 4:33 AMTo: DeNatale, Richard; Venger, LeonardSubject: RE: Nitsch antitrust case Hi Rich and Len. Yes, they can do this. This is a sort of administrative motion that is used to get related cases before the same judge. Sometimes, if the clerk immediately sees a case is related to other cases, he will just assign it to the judge handling the other cases. Here, since the case is filed in the Northern District, where the other cases are pending before Judge Koh, they can do it through this motion rather than go through the MDL process. Below is an article that appeared in Comp Law360 this morning. It notes that this case is at a very different stage than the other cases and that might weigh against consolidating it with them, but we think it is likely to be sent to Judge Koh. The story refers to Judge Koh’s order rejecting the recent settlement. A copy of that order is attached in case you don’t have it and would like to review it. Please let me know if you have any questions. Best regards, David Judge Koh Urged To Take On DreamWorks Anti-Poaching SuitShare us on: By Kurt OrzeckLaw360, Los Angeles (September 15, 2014, 10:26 PM ET) -- An ex-Sony Pictures Animation technical director asked a California federal judge on Monday to relate with the massive Google Inc. antitrust action she is overseeing, his proposed class action accusing DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc., The Walt Disney Co. and others of conspiring to not poach each other’s animators.Robert A. Nitsch Jr. asked U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh, who is presiding over In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, to also hear his suit, arguing the cases are closely related.Filed last week Nitsch's suit claims secret agreements among Pixar Inc., Apple Inc.,Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC, Google, Intel Corp. and others to not cold-call their employees and to avoid bidding wars, extended to the animation and digital effects studios behind “Shrek,” “Harry Potter” and “Transformers.” Those deals suppressed salaries across the industry in violation of antitrust laws, the suit says.Nitsch said Monday that a significant amount of his suit and the Google action — which is set to go to trial April 9, 2015 — concern the same parties and events, and that assigning them separately would result in an unduly burdensome duplication of labor and expense for the Northern District of California.""Over the course of four years and the most significant motions in a class action, Judge Koh has reviewed the considerable record evidence and fielded and decided many of the legal issues present in both cases, work that would have to be done more or less from scratch by any new judge,"" Monday's motion said.Nitsch's complaint cites documents and deposition transcripts from the Google suit, allegedly showing how a deal Apple and Pixar founder Steve Jobs struck with Lucasfilm founder George Lucas spread to more than a half-dozen studios. Jobs made a “no raid” deal with DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg in 2004, and the agreements expanded once Disney bought Pixar in 2006, according to Nitsch's suit.In the allegedly related case, the software engineers had sued Apple, Google and other Silicon Valley companies in May 2011 for damages, claiming that the companies had agreed to provide each other notice whenever one made an offer to another company's employee. They also agreed to cap pay packages for prospective hires to prevent bidding wars, and to abstain from recruiting one another's personnel, those plaintiffs contend.Judge Koh last month rejected a proposed $324.5 million settlement in the case, expressing concern that it would offer class members proportionally less than an $11 million deal struck by Intuit Inc. and a $9 million deal struck by Lucasfilm and Pixar.Nitsch's case is currently assigned to U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria. Nitsch claimed Monday that ""[w]hile there can be no doubt that Judge Chhabria is more than capable of handling this case, the simple fact is that Judge Koh has already done much of the relevant work.""Nitsch also argued that it isn't material that the two suits are at different stages, and that they are substantially similar even though they don't share the same defendants and all the same facts and evidence. He said there isn't any risk of delay in either suit due to relation.An attorney for Nitsch declined immediate additional comment Monday.Attorneys for the defendants in his suit didn't immediately respond to requests for comment late Monday.Nitsch is represented by Daniel A. Small, Brent W. Johnson, Jeffrey B. Dubner, George F. Farah and Matthew Ruan of Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll PLLC; Bruce V. Spiva of The Spiva Law Firm PLLC; and Richard L. Grossman of Pillsbury & Coleman LLP.Counsel information for the defendants was not immediately available.The cases are Nitsch v. DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. et al., case number 5:14-cv-04062; and In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, case number 5:11-cv-02509, both in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.--Additional reporting by Michael Lipkin, Vin Gurrieri, Scott Flaherty and Melissa Lipman.

"Financial Times: Apple in talks for $3.2bn Beats deal Financial Times: Apple in talks for $3.2bn Beats deal By Matthew Garrahan and Tim Bradshaw May 8, 2014 Apple is closing in on its largest ever acquisition with the planned $3.2bn purchase of Beats Electronics, the headphone maker and music streaming operator founded by music producer Jimmy Iovine and the hip-hop star Dr Dre. The deal could be announced as early as next week, people familiar with the negotiations said, but they cautioned that some details had yet to be agreed and talks could still fall apart. A deal of this scale would represent a radical departure for Tim Cook, chief executive of the iPhone maker: under the late Steve Jobs, Apple was reluctant to pursue high-profile acquisitions. Apple will acquire Beats’ streaming music service, which launched this year, and its audio equipment business, which includes its brand of headphones and audio equipment. The Beats management team will report to Mr Cook, said people familiar with the deal. Apple and Beats declined to comment. A decade after Mr Jobs transformed the music industry with the iTunes download store and the iPod digital music player, the deal is likely to be seen as an admission that Apple needs to look outside its Cupertino labs to continue making an impact. While Beats commands a leading position in the premium headphone market, its real value to Apple is in revitalising its “cool” at a time when iTunes has waned in popularity and Samsung’s marketing campaigns have savaged the iPhone’s brand. Apple executives have admitted that its brand is in need of a revamp. Internal emails released during its recent patent trial with Samsung showed that its marketing chief Phil Schiller considered changing Apple’s ad agency after the success of its Korean rival’s “next big thing” campaign. Apple is paying a hefty premium for cool: Beats took a $500m investment from Carlyle in September 2013 that valued the company at more than $1bn. “In terms of acquisitions, Apple has been very, very light in their activity,” said Richard Lane, analyst at Moody’s. “I don’t think they’ve spent $1bn in any of the last four years.” Mr Cook said last month Apple was “on the prowl” for more acquisitions, after buying 24 companies in the past 18 months and he was not averse to large acquisitions. The Beats move follows a string of high-priced deals in Silicon Valley, after Google acquired smart home developer Nest Labs for $3.2bn and Facebook offered an initial $19bn for WhatsApp Messenger. One motivation for the Beats deal may lie in shifts in music consumption. Subscription services are the biggest growth area for the music industry, with revenues increasing 50 per cent to $1.1bn in 2013, according to a recent report by the IFPI, the global music industry association. But downloads fell 2 per cent to $3.93bn – the first annual decline since Apple launched its iTunes store in 2003. iTunes is still the world’s largest music download service. Apple has dabbled in music streaming but never launched an unlimited subscription service to compete with fast-growing rivals to iTunes such as Spotify. In 2009 it acquired Lala, a music streaming service, and last year launched iTunes Radio, which competes with elements of Beats, as well as more established players such as Pandora. Mr Iovine and Dr Dre – real name Andre Young – were inspired to create Beats by the poor sound quality of the headphones bundled with the iPod and iPhone. Beloved by music and sports stars Beats has become a street-smart fashion brand Ahead of Apple’s expected launch of an ‘iWatch’ accessory, Beats will also give its designers and engineers access to years of experience in what some see as the original “wearable technology”. Nonetheless, the pricey deal is likely to raise questions about Apple’s internal capability to innovate after the death of Mr Jobs in 2011. At the end of March, Apple’s global cash pile stood at $133bn, net of the $17bn in debt it raised last year. Since then it has raised a further $12bn, which it said at the time was to help fund its $130bn dividend and share buyback programme. However, most of its funds are held overseas and its domestic cash has fallen by $16bn to $18bn since it resumed paying dividends in 2012.",Private

Whereas Molly's Game is ready to be written right now and the only research I need is Molly. I told Mike that for that reason I'd be doing both at the same time and that in fact I'd already started the process. Mike wrote back that the studio would prefer I deliver Flash Boys before starting Molly's Game. I was then told by Mark Gordon that Sony was ""withdrawing its interest"" in Molly's Game. I wondered what happened between our lunch--where you showed a lot of enthusiasm for Molly's Game and in fact bristled at the idea of me even meeting with other studios--and yesterday. All of this is happening against the backdrop of the disintegration of Steve Jobs, which is completely blowing my mind. I asked Ari a question on the phone and he was unable to answer it so I'll ask you. If I turned in a terrific draft of Flash Boys, why would it have a better chance of getting made than Steve Jobs? The protagonist is Asian-American (actually Asian-Canadian) and there aren't any Asian movie stars.

Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the actor has fallen off the Jobs biopic that is being directed by Danny Boyle. Sources say Bale, after much deliberation and conflicting feelings, came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw. -- Stacey Snider has joined 20th Century Fox as co-chairman of the film studio. Fox Film chairman and CEO Jim Gianopulos made the announcement yesterday. -- X-Men character Gambit is getting his own spinoff movie with Channing Tatum as the card-savvy protagonist, Fox has set Robocop scribe Josh Zetumer to write the screenplay. The studio has officially attached Tatum to star, and produce. -- The Furious 7 trailer debuted on Saturday and hasn’t stopped roaring around social media since, Facebook says, passing 100 million views in the 48 hours since it first premiered on the site. Facebook is pushing itself to Hollywood as a better alternative than Google’s YouTube for marketing video online, and recent user data suggests that Facebook is making significant progress against the longtime king of online video. -- Starting Tuesday people who register with the Disney Movies Anywhere app and buy a copy of “Frozen” from the Google Play store on an Android tablet, can later watch the film on an Apple TV through their iTunes library. Until now, Apple has restricted movies, TV shows and other content to its own family of iOS devices, along with Mac or Windows computers. Google placed similar restriction on its digital store and Android-powered devices. -- Ridley Scott’s Scott Free and Principato-Young are teaming to acquire and develop On Call In Hell, the bestselling memoir by heroic battlefield doctor Rich Jadick and his days in Fallujah risking his own life trying to triage and rush gravely wounded American soldiers to safety before they bled out. He often defied orders and his own survival concerns to do it, and his bravery makes Jadick reminiscent of Jeremy Renner’s bomb de-fuser in The Hurt Locker. Jadick, a marine officer and surgeon, was the first doctor in the armed forces ever to be awarded the bronze star for valor in combat for his heroic acts in Iraq. Scott isn’t looking to helm this one but they will secure a filmmaker quickly. --Layoffs at WB will begin today, cutting approximately 1,000 jobs globally as part of a company-wide belt-tightening. The layoffs amount to more than 10% of the studio’s roughly 8,000-person workforce. The cuts across the film and TV divisions are expected to take place in two waves, with roughly half beginning this week. The remaining layoffs will be finished by the end of the calendar year. Among those areas expected to be most impacted are real estate, home entertainment, information and technology and finance. -- Dolby Laboratories Inc announced it has acquired Doremi Labs. The deal allows Dolby to advance the cinema experience for moviegoers with help from Burbank-based Doremi, a digital cinema technology company founded in 1985. The deal is valued at $92.5 million in cash plus an additional $20 million in contingent consideration that may be earned over a four-year period.

"Your Message Subject or Title 2014 CULTURAL ALMANAC ZEITGUIDE ""Business and Finance"" IMAGE BY KRISTOFER PORTER Lone geniuses are out. Collaboration is in. A sign of the times: Walter Isaacson, known for his deep biographies—Steve Jobs, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Kissinger—has abandoned the individual genius genre. In his soon-to-be-released book, The Innovators, Isaacson notes that “There are thousands of books celebrating people we biographers portray, or mythologize, as lone inventors. I’ve produced a few myself…. But we have far fewer tales of collaborative creativity. Innovation comes from teams more often than from light-bulb moments of lone geniuses.” Everyone is talking about the power of collaboration. Inc. online has a whole channel dedicated to team building. Crowdsourcing produces everything from gadgets to commercials. Dozens of recent business books, such as Collaboration: How Leaders Avoid The Traps, Create Unity, and Reap Big Results, offer advice on optimizing networks. Even large management consulting firms like McKinsey are publishing reports on the keys to successful collaboration. And businesses are literally breaking down the walls to boost collaborative interaction. Ed Catmull in his recent book Creativity, Inc. describes how he and his partners at Pixar moved their offices from the top floor to the second floor, “right in the middle of things” and located bathrooms strategically in the center of the building to encourage employees from different departments to exchange ideas. At the same time, companies such as that of our friends at Undercurrent are re-shaping corporations’ organizational structure into a “holacracy.” A holacratic company replaces its linear hierarchy with overlapping autonomous teams, or “circles,” so workers have the power to make decisions and lead in a variety of roles, while also working together. But, not everyone buys the collaboration cure. Susan Cain, author of the recent bestseller Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking fears that “our companies, our schools and our culture are in thrall to an idea I call the New Groupthink, which holds that creativity and achievement come from an oddly gregarious place.” She holds that “people are more creative when they enjoy privacy and freedom from interruption.” ZEITGUIDE friend Joshua Wolf Shenk splits the difference: “Lone genius isn’t good, but neither is a ‘hive-mind’,” he tells us. His recent book, Powers of Two: Finding the Essence of Innovation in Creative Pairs, argues that it takes two to birth the new. Writing chapters on John Lennon & Paul McCartney, Larry Page & Sergey Brin, even Jobs and Wozniak, Shenk suggests that “The lone-genius myth prevents us from grappling with a series of paradoxes about creative pairs: that distance doesn’t impede intimacy, and is often a crucial ingredient of it; that competition and collaboration are often entwined.” One person can be the blue-sky visionary while the other reels the ideas down to Earth. Why such a spike in fascination about optimal conditions for collaboration? For businesses, mobilizing whole teams effectively is the only way to move fast enough to stay relevant and ahead of the competition. At the same time, through cloud technology, mobile devices, enterprise social platforms, and big data work-force analysis, we can better communicate, collaborate, and even calculate collaborative success. But there’s more to it. The social, business and scientific questions we seek to answer, as well as the global-scale problems that we must solve—we are acknowledging that those are now bigger than any one person can tackle. Whether we want to sell more products or arrest climate change, like it or not, we’re going to have to work together.

"katie FYI only. I just didn’t want to surprise you. Katie Cotton, Apple’s Vice President of Communications, Is Leaving ByDaisuke Wakabayashi WSJ Katie Cotton Katie Cotton, Apple’s vice president of world-wide communications and the powerful gatekeeper to co-founder Steve Jobs and current Chief Executive Tim Cook, is leaving after 18 years at the company. In an email, Cotton said her decision was motivated by her desire to spend more time with her two children. “This is very hard for me. I have been here for almost two decades and Apple is part of my heart and soul,” she said. Cotton headed up communications for Apple, one of the most secretive companies in the technology world, during a period of incredible growth fueled by the introduction of the iPhone and iPad. She is one of the driving forces behind Apple’s carefully orchestrated product launches. Her public relations team aggressively controlled the message around new key products and maintained an air of mystery around the company and the brand. “Katie has given her all to this company for over 18 years. She has wanted to spend more time with her children for some time now. We are really going to miss her,” Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said. Apple declined to say when she would be leaving or if a replacement has been selected. Her move was reported earlier by Re/code.",Private
"I loved Steve and really vibed with him but he needed to approve me by ""committee"" according to my manager and the rest of the agents that would have to be on board weren't. So Sarah said he passed. I haven't spoken to him yet but I was going to send an e-mail just thanking him for his time. Thanks anyway. Really appreciate you making the call for me.I know Sarah is submitting me to read for the role of Lisa in the Steve Jobs movie you guys are doing but I also know that might just be offer only.Â Nothing else going on on my end.

"NYT: Yahoo Rolls the Dice on TV David Carr THE MEDIA EQUATION 4/13/14 Yahoo, a company that seems like a permanent adolescent in search of an identity, is about to try a new persona: high-quality television programmer. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company’s chief executive, Marissa Mayer, is “looking for series that are ready to launch and don’t require a lot of development.” Well, aren’t we all? At a time when the culture is addicted to high-end television narratives, Yahoo wants in on the action, partly because while its site may have (flat) traffic — 700 million global visits a month — and (declining) revenue, it has zero cachet and no discernible way forward. For many years, digital media players watched longingly as HBO and then AMC, FX and Showtime managed to rise above the clutter on television, where Americans still spend five hours a day. So last year, when Netflixbroke through with “House of Cards,” it made sense that companies like Amazon, Hulu and Yahoo would want to follow suit. There are signs that it is working — streaming for Amazon Prime tripled in the last year and the company has introduced its own device, Fire TV, which will fight for shelf space in your home along with Apple TV, Chromecast and Roku. At the same time, Comcast is seeking a merger that will give it the scale to invest in technology, and HBO Go is pushing to follow the consumer onto mobile. “People always want to be what they aren’t,” said Jonah Peretti of BuzzFeed when we discussed the crisscross the other day. The prize is dear. Winning in the distribution of high-end content is about mining an audience, and you can’t blame technology companies for believing they have relevant skill sets. Silicon Valley has capitalized on its ability to create compelling software that animates devices and, very often, the people sitting in front of them. Surely, industry executives believed, they could head down the coast 400 miles and make a different kind of software using stars and sophisticated production values with some success. How hard could it be? The answer is, very hard indeed. “It is the pure arrogance of the newly rich and the newly powerful to think content is easy,” said John Landgraf, chief executive of FX Networks, which has had success with “Justified” and “The Americans.” “Breaking through in a cluttered marketplace requires expertise in all of the elements of storytelling. There are so many ways it can go wrong.” It can be done, as HBO has demonstrated. Right now, in spite of all the competitors who are trying to eat its lucrative lunch, the premium cable service is crushing it. “Game of Thrones,” a fantasy-inspired epic, has become an unlikely bona fide hit, with 6.6 million people tuning in for the premiere of its fourth season. “True Detective,” a moody swamp-noir set in Louisiana, became a much-talked about win this winter, and “Silicon Valley” is about to have a moment, nailing the greedy hippie ethos that makes the tech world such a compelling, silly place. Comedies like “Veep” and “Girls” did well enough to earn their spots as well as their renewals. But in the years leading up to those successes, not even HBO seemed able to be HBO. Using its tried and true formula of funding proven auteurs, the network followed up “The Sopranos” with “Luck,” “John From Cincinnati” and “Treme” — shows that it was equally proud of, but that failed to connect with an audience. A company executive described the period as “those years we don’t talk about.” I have covered television (and film) long enough to know that wandering around Sunset Boulevard with a big bag of money shopping for programming is more likely to result in a mugging than a hit show. It requires connections in the agency world, technical muscle, moody writers, fragile stars — the list goes on. And even if you navigate all those shoals adroitly — spending large amounts of money the whole way — there also has to be some luck, a serendipitous grab of the zeitgeist. It’s a tough racket. Hollywood and Silicon Valley regard each other with mutual suspicion. The entertainment industry is viewed as a metric-free place of profligate whimsy by the engineering culture, and the valley is seen as a place that has no regard for intellectual property and a profound lack of taste. “Say what you will about Hollywood, the mechanism for finding talent is actually pretty good,” said Mike Judge, a former programmer in Silicon Valley who went on to make “Beavis and Butt-Head,” “Office Space” and, most recently, HBO’s “Silicon Valley.” “People in Silicon Valley are generally smarter than people in Hollywood, but it takes a different kind of intelligence to make television, especially a lot of it, and do it well,” Mr. Judge said. “Telling stories requires lots of skills, not just making people laugh, but also who does the best color correction.” Yahoo is especially unplugged from that world. In her move to differentiate on quality, Ms. Mayer has looked at more than 100 projects and is leaning hard on Kathy Savitt, Yahoo’s chief marketing officer, according to The Journal. But neither has much significant history in the entertainment business, and Mickie Rosen and Erin McPherson, two executives familiar with the media business, recently left the company. This is not the first time that Yahoo has made a big push into Hollywood — in 2004, it had a well-covered foray into major productions with major stars, an effort that ended in naught. “This is a very hard business with a very high reward,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Yahoo feels compelled to do it because of problems that they have and the opportunity it represents, but they have a lot less skill and knowledge than the other players.” He added, “Finding a big audience that uses you to make their life easier or more convenient, as Yahoo has by creating something useful, is very different than providing a cultural experience that scratches a very deep part of the brain.” “House of Cards” is a great aiming point for other digital players, but that achievement was not easy. Begin with the fact that Netflix was able tocollect years of data on consumers through its video-rental service. It already had a significant distribution platform in television, something that Yahoo, which lives on desktop and mobile, sorely lacks. Netflix booked David Fincher, a director with proven commercial and creative credentials, to produce the series, then pushed it into the public consciousness with a blunt-force marketing campaign on and off the service. Before “House of Cards,” Netflix made “Lilyhammer,” which entered the water like an Olympic dive, without so much as a ripple. Two series that followed, “Hemlock Grove” and “Arrested Development,” came and went without a lot of bounce. “Orange Is the New Black” may have turned heads, but it will be years before Netflix has the kind of batting average that will put it in the front ranks of programmers. The list of technology companies that have prospered over the long haul in entertainment is short. I can think only of what Apple’s Steve Jobs did with Pixar before selling it to Disney. In that case, vast processing power was paired with an absolute devotion to great stories. No other lasting success comes to mind. For Yahoo, changing lanes from creating and hosting short-form video content to making lush, dramatic narratives is a bit like expecting a good sprinter to run a marathon. With all the money sloshing around, maybe it’s time I consider pitching a series of my own. In the one I’m thinking about, the much-lauded chief executive of a tech company decides to go Hollywood in search of an identity and any kind of win. High jinks, plenty of mordant humor and a trail of tears ensue.

This will mean looking deep into the production of these films, pondering tone, storyline, casting, state of mind of the market itself, etc. For example, we are seeing wild swings in the market for movies based on Young Adult books and we really need to understand what separates the Hunger Games from Divergent from Mortal Instruments and what separates Fault in Our Stars from If I Stay.

"Update From HO Conference Call - Euro | LatAm on 8 JUL 2014 Dear All, Please find following a top line overview of yesterday's European | LatAm call with home office. As always, this information is PRIVILEGED and CONFIDENTIAL and only for internal purpose and reference. Due to the confidential nature and sensitive topics discussed during the call, the overview notes are streamlined and generic in its content with focus on key points only. Generally, individual territory discussion has been omitted. Please check with your territory home office supervisor for confirmation and further details if needed. With regards, Brett. The call was chaired by Jeff Blake and commenced at 8:55am. The call duration was 56min and concluded at 9:51am PST. 22 Jump Street: Congratulations to everyone so far! This is turning into a real winner. The US is heading to $180M and international at $125M, providing over $300M worldwide on the picture. A big hit and a big success handled in a great way on every step. We are beating “Neighbors” everywhere and we have won at all levels. Kudos to Paul and the dubbing teams on doing a great job. We only expect the success to continue for the markets yet to release. Deliver Us From Evil: The US has been tougher than we would have liked and are probably headed to around the high $30’s level. International, based on our first openings, remains on track to meet budget levels. It feels ok right now but we will get a better sense once some of the Latin markets open and importantly, Australia. International will be key to ensure that we remain financially positive on the release. Think Like A Man Too: Still having discussion on the Kevin Hart tour. Will look to have the final answer in the next day or so and depending on that outcome, we will then review what will be needed on level of spend support. Sex Tape: The big hope is we can do the same thing on SEX TAPE that we have done on 22JS, particularly for international where you are not hampered with the same restrictions that we have in the US domestic market. Cameron Diaz has been doing a remarkable job with the press and tour activities that are really adding value. So far the zeitgeist is good and we are making the right moves. It is not the easiest summer we have ever had with competitive films circling around in the US and working around the World Cup in international but all we need is a couple of breaks and SEX TAPE can take full advantage of it. The dynamic is very positive! The producers are nothing but positive. The stars are nothing but positive. We’d love to win on this one together! Australia opens with the US and the first major European market will be Russia the week after on 7/24. We are going to know the score pretty quick with these openings and what the future outcome direction will be. Whilst there are some tracking concerns in select early release markets, the territories remain very confident in the knowledge that the local media campaigns are really only starting and they expect to see big jumps with immediate effect in the tracking results. All markets are happy with the materials and believe they have what is needed to open the film. BAD TEACHER is going to be the main comparison and getting close to those figures will be the desired goal. “The Other Woman” will also be a comparison title depending on the level of success on a territory-by-territory basis. Whilst we may not sustain as well as the two comparison films we need to get it open to similar levels, if not better. This would be a great place to start. Nothing works as a perfect comparison but we need to be in the vicinity of both. We don’t necessarily need to crack $100M, whilst we would love to, but we need to be at least at 80-85% at minimum. We want to make sure we are doing everything right in terms of materials, budgets, dating, prints – everything. It is an important picture as the summer progresses for both US domestic and international. We have two campaign directions available – one that is fun, couple, relatable, comedy approach and the second that pushes the envelope a bit more. The markets can use what will best work for them. We may have Rob Lowe join the next tour stops. He’s been fantastic, completely on message and the press loves him. Upcoming Projects – Highly Confidential: Will Smith Project – we are hoping to go forward on this film. Majority of the box office target will be on the US domestic shoulders. We would look to date it early in the fourth quarter and hopefully it will have some awards potential. Steve Jobs Project – the script is fantastic, a terrific story that really has not been told – even with the recent Ashton Kutcher version already out there. A great response from the markets who are very keen to see this project go forward, especially with the writer, director and cast choices. Bad Teacher 2 – this time round Cameron will be a student needing to get some credits to keep her teaching qualifications. This film could happen quickly and be ready for release in 2015. Markets response was mixed. Those who did ok on the first film were positive but other markets felt it would be hard to replicate the success. Inferno – less than exciting for the US so it is kind of stalling, how important is it for international? The majority of markets said yes, they want to go for it and that there was still interest in the franchise. Some markets did feel it was old and tired with declining franchise results. That said, even with a drop in box office figures it would still be a significant contribution if it were to go ahead. Little House On The Prairie – a resounding no thanks.

"a few good men? cool idea....That play is a little like my high school yearbook picture but with the right cast it could be cool. And you own it. I love the idea of live theater on television. It's how television started. There are three movies I want to write.1. Flash Boys. I've spent some time with Scott and we're meeting again next week. We think we have a fun take on a good guys on Wall Street story.2. The Politician. I optioned this book when it came out a few years ago. It's written by Andrew Young, the aide to John Edwards who falsely claimed paternity of Rielle Hunter's baby to cover for his hero and boss. He then received immunity from the Justice Department in exchange for being the government's star witness in the case against Edwards. There's much more to this story than what was in the tabloids and I think enough time has passed now for it not to seem like a ripped-from-the-headlines movie. Two great roles.3. Molly's Game. Molly Bloom was the 3rd best skier in the country when she was a senior at the University of Colorado with a 4.0 GPA. A wipe-out during Olympic trials kept her off the team and sent her life on a bizarre trajectory. 10 years later 20 FBI agents would be pointing automatic weapons at her while she stood at her apartment door in the middle of the night. In between she ran the most exclusive high stakes poker game in Hollywood and then New York, where she didn't realize she was being run by the Russian mob. The book itself isn't very good. But just as you could take The Accidental Billionaires and make it a movie about college kids throwing cash up in the air and dancing with hookers on yachts, there's a much more interesting and poignant story than just the decadence of the underground poker scene. I just wanted to catch you up on where I was and tell you how excited I am to get moving again on Steve Jobs. I hope you're well.Aaron",Private

"I thought I had to try ; onwards ! Robert Newman | WME rnewman@wmeentertainment.com 310.246.3196 -----Original Message----- From: Robert Newman Sent: Sunday, September 21, 2014 1:42 PM To: DiCaprio Leonardo Cc: Yorn' 'Rick Subject: Dear Leonardo, I'm writing as I heard last week of the sad news that you may not be doing'Jobs'. While I am of course biased, I nevertheless want to give you my thoughts with the hope that this somehow stays together. Certainly on Danny's part, he's long wanted to work with you again, and in the 15 years since ""The beach"" you have both grown immeasurably in your craft and abilities. With this text, Danny feels he's found a script that can be as enduring a character study and portrait of our age and times as 'Citizen Kane 'was for a previous generation, from a writer who is the equal of Paddy Chayevsky. With Scott Rudin, you have a producer who is perhaps the greatest ever at making intelligent, important films in partnership with Sony who, as we've seen with films such as ""the social network"", ""Capt. Phillips""and ""Moneyball"" ,will spend the necessary marketing and publicity money to get audiences and award attention. Steve Jobs was a man who came from nothing and nowhere to change the world ,as surely as Thomas Edison did, and and there's no better actor than you with the artistry and talent to help people understand what that must've been like. Further, the production isn't set in the middle of the jungle, nor require a physical transformation, but will be shot in a city such as San Francisco, allowing you to give your sole creative focus to exploring the richness of the dialogue and character, with your pick of costars. Just as you must surely feel great pride in helping bring Marty his Oscar on ""the departed"", everyone involved in this production desperately wants to help bring you the Academy award you so richly deserve. I remember speaking with you years ago about 'boogie nights', and all you could have done with that wonderful part, and I truly believe this is an opportunity we will look back on with regret if we don't make happen. Your pal, Robert Sent from my iPhone",Private
