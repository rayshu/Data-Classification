"8 2009 EDITORIAL Change you can download. Wikileaks has released nearly a billion dollars worth of quasi-secret reports commissioned by the United States Congress. Frontpage of sample CRS report RL31555: China and Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Missiles: Policy Issues dated January 7 2009. A full listing of reports is available here. The 6780 reports current as of this month comprise over 127000 pages of material on some of the most contentious issues in the nation from the U.S. relationship with Israel to the financial collapse. Nearly 2300 of the reports were updated in the last 12 months while the oldest report goes back to 1990. The release represents the total output of the Congressional Research Service (CRS) electronically available to Congressional offices. The CRS is Congress's analytical agency and has a budget in excess of $100M per year. Open government lawmakers such as Senators John McCain (R-Arizona) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vermont) have fought for years to make the reports public with bills being introduced--and rejected--almost every year since 1998. The CRS as a branch of Congress is exempt from the Freedom of Information Act. CRS reports are highly regarded as non-partisan in-depth and timely. The reports top the list of the """"10 Most-Wanted Government Documents"""" compiled by the Washington based Center for Democracy and Technology[1]. The Federation of American Scientists in pushing for the reports to be made public stated that the """"CRS is Congress' Brain and it's useful for the public to be plugged into it""""[2]. While Wired magazine called their concealment """"The biggest Congressional scandal of the digital age""""[3]. Although all CRS reports are legally in the public domain they are quasi-secret because the CRS as a matter of policy makes the reports available only to members of Congress Congressional committees and select sister agencies such as the GAO. Members of Congress are free to selectively release CRS reports to the public but are only motivated to do so when they feel the results would assist them politically. Universally embarrassing reports are kept quiet. Each time the topic of opening up the reports comes up it runs into walls erected by opposing lawmakers such as Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) who """"like many members of Congress views CRS as an extension of his staff"""". If the reports were made public """"every time a member requests a particular document the public may infer that he's staking out a particular policy position."""" (Aaron Saunders Stevens' spokesman Washington Post 2007)[4]. However that hasn't stopped a grey market forming around the documents. Opportunists smuggle out nearly all reports and sell them to cashed up special interests--lobbyists law firms multi-nationals and presumably foreign governments. Congress has turned a blind eye to special interest access while continuing to vote down public access. Opposition to public availability comes not only from members of Congress but also from within the CRS. One might think that the CRS as an agency of the Library of Congress would institutionally support having a wider audience. But an internal memo reveals the CRS lobbying against bills (S. Res. 54 and H.R. 3630) which would have given the public access to its reports (Project on Government Secrecy FAS 2003)[5]. The primary line pushed by the CRS is the one that appeals most to Congressional members--open publication would prevent spin control. The memo states this in delicate terms referring to such spin failures as """"Impairment of Member Communication with Constituents"""". Of course the CRS doesn't really care about politicians facing much needed voter discipline but it does have reasons of its own to avoid public oversight. Institutionally the CRS has established an advisory relationship with members of Congress similar to the oversight-free relationship established between intelligence agencies and the office of the President. Free from meaningful public oversight of its work the CRS as """"Congress's brain"""" is able to influence Congressional outcomes even when its reports contain errors. Arguably its institutional power over congress is second only to the parties themselves. Public oversight would reduce its ability to exercise that influence without criticism. That is why it opposes such oversight and that is why such oversight must be established immediately. In 1913 Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis a forceful proponent for open government stated """"Sunlight is the best disinfectant; electric light the most efficient policeman"""". Those wise words are still true today. Welcome Congress to our generation's electric sun.

"' collection of over 6500 Congressional Research Service (CRS) documents. The CRS is an agency of the United States Library of Congress tasked with """"providing policy and legal analysis to committees and Members of both the House and Senate regardless of party affiliation.""""[1] Although all CRS reports are legally in the public domain they are quasi-secret because CRS does not make them available to the public nor provide any sort of catalog or index.[2] CRS reports are highly regarded as in-depth accurate objective and timely and topped the list of """"10 Most-Wanted Government Documents"""" in a 1996 survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology.[3] While CRS products are already available electronically to """"members of Congress Congressional committees and CRS sister agencies (e.g. GAO)"""" through the internal """"CRS Web"""" system there is no public access as independent librarian Stephen Young notes: CRS produces a number of document types although the most commonly requested are the reports (almost 4000 reports are currently in existence). The purpose of a report is to clearly define the issue in the legislative context. The reports may take many forms including policy analysis economic studies statistical reviews and legal analyses. ... Over 700 new CRS reports are produced each year and made available on CRS Web to the select groups identified above. ... All of these documents are produced at the request of and for the use of members of Congress. They are not intended for public consumption or for dissemination to libraries.[4] Many but not all CRS reports can be obtained through specialized publishers such as Penny Hill Press or from web archives such as OpenCRS which relies on individual submissions to maintain its collection. OpenCRS has also published instructions for US citizens on how to request reports from their member of congress but neither the Congress nor the CRS are obligated to satisfy such requests (though they could presumably be compelled to do so through the FOIA.) There have been numerous attempts to pass legislation requiring the CRS to make its products available on a public web site including the introduction of bills in 1998 1999 2001 and 2003.[4] All have so far failed to pass. Publicly stated reasons for this include legal liability for CRS findings copyright issues and increased CRS workload. However it is far more more likely that the members of Congress who commission CRS reports wish to maintain control over the distribution of any potentially sensitive conclusions.

It is probable that as a function of how """"available"""" CRS reports are to non-congressmen CRS also receives pressure by external interests to include or omit certain information within the reports thus violating the integrity of the composition process. By this view a fully open CRS would be a compromised CRS whose reports and briefs would rapidly become useless since they would be sterilized for public scrutiny as they were being written.

Bazan and Morton Rosenberg American Law Division Date: May 31 2005 Abstract This report addresses Congress' oversight authority over individual federal judges or Supreme Court Justices. Congressional oversight authority although broad is limited to subjects related to the exercise of legitimate congressional power. While Congress has the power to regulate the structure administration and jurisdiction of the courts its power over the judicial acts of individual judges or Justices is more restricted. For instance Congress has limited authority to remove or discipline a judge for decisions made on the bench. Article III Section 1 of the Constitution provides that judges have """"good behavior"""" tenure which effectively has come to mean lifetime tenure for Article III judges subject to removal only through conviction on impeachment. However impeachment of a judge or Justice requires a finding that such judge or Justice has engaged in a """"High Crime or Misdemeanor.""""

"Enforcement and Intelligence Information: The Congressional Role CRS report number: RL33873 Author(s): Richard A. Best Jr. Foreign Affairs Defense and Trade Division Date: February 13 2007 Abstract Laws and regulations have changed significantly since September 2001 and an Information Sharing Executive (ISE) has been established within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to design and implement information sharing procedures. It is clear however that sustaining the exchange of law enforcement and intelligence information remains a challenge. In particular there is continued concern about sharing of information that might in some way jeopardize the rights of free speech or association of U.S. persons. This opposition has contributed to the difficulty Congress has had in addressing legislation in this area and can be expected to continue. Some argue that given the extent of legislation enacted in recent years extensive oversight of information sharing efforts may be an appropriate way to ensure that the balance between ensuring domestic security and protecting civil liberties can be maintained.

"Bank Charter: Current Legal Process and Congressional Response CRS report number: RS22364 Author(s): Michael V. Seitzinger American Law Division Date: December 21 2006 Abstract There are several statutory requirements imposed by the Credit Union Membership Access Act (CUMAA) for converting a federal credit union to a mutual savings bank. In addition the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) the federal agency that charters and supervises federal credit unions has issued regulations requiring significant disclosures by a federal credit union attempting to convert its charter to a mutual savings bank. Some of these disclosures are considered by critics to be speculative in nature such as whether the directors of the converted institution intend later to convert to a stock-issuing entity thereby possibly enriching themselves. Others believe that this kind of information is at the heart of the conversion process and should be disclosed. H.R. 3206 109th Congress was introduced to limit the kinds of disclosures required in particular disclosures of a speculative nature. On May 11 2006 the House Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit held hearings on the bill. On December 14 2006 the NCUA approved final rules governing conversions of credit unions to mutual savings banks or mutual savings associations.

Holds are a longstanding custom of the Senate that enabled Members to provide notice to their party leader of their intent to object on the floor to taking up or passing a measure or matter. Their potency as a blocking delaying or bargaining device is linked to Senators' ability to conduct filibusters or object to unanimous consent agreements or requests. The new holds process outlined in Section 512 is designed to constrain the frequency of anonymous holds and promote more openness and transparency with respect to their use. Ultimately it is up to the majority leader of the Senate - who sets the chamber's agenda after consulting various people - to decide whether or for how long he will honor a colleague's hold.

"31555 Author(s): Shirley A.

This problem refers to the threat of nuclear chemical or biological weapons and missiles that could deliver them. Some have argued that certain PRC transfers violated international treaties or guidelines and/or have contravened various U.S. laws requiring sanctions to shore up those international standards. Even if no laws or treaties are violated many view China's transfers as threatening U.S. security interests. Using a variety of unclassified consultations and sources this CRS Report discusses the national security problem of the PRC's role in weapons proliferation and issues related to the U.S. policy response including legislation since the mid-1990s.

The USA PATRIOT Act expanded the authority under four of the NSL statutes and created the fifth. Thereafter the authority has been reported to have been widely used.

"Background and Analysis CRS report number: 96-767 Author(s): Shirley A. Kan Foreign Affairs and National Defense Division Date: September 13 1996 Abstract Congress has been concerned about Chinese missile nuclear and chemical-related transfers. In 1991 and 1993 the U.S. government twice determined Chinese violations of the Missile Technology Control Regime guidelines and determined both cases to have involved transfers of Category II missile components for the M-11 short-range ballistic missile to Pakistan. Although the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) does not ban peaceful nuclear projects certain Chinese nuclear transfers to Pakistan and Iran may have violated the NPT and/or U.S. laws. In 1995 China reportedly sold to Pakistan unsafeguarded ring magnets that could be used for uranium enrichment. The Clinton Administration decided that U.S. sanctions were not warranted. Since 1992 China has responded to U.S. and other pressures to participate in some parts of international nonproliferation regimes.

"National Security Whistleblowers CRS report number: RL33215 Author(s): Louis Fisher Government and Finance Division Date: December 30 2005 Abstract Congress and the President have often collided over access to information within the executive branch. Although executive officials recognize that they have a duty to keep Congress informed and to share agency documents domestic as well as national security on some occasions the executive branch will invoke different types of privileges to block congressional access. Congressional committees can issue subpoenas and either house may hold executive officials in contempt for refusing to release documents or to testify. However those measures are extreme and are taken only after customary efforts to find a compromise have collapsed. In the midst of some of these confrontations Presidents have issued orders to executive agencies to limit information to Congress particularly to prevent agency employees from going directly to Congress. Congress has responded with statutes to keep the lanes of information open. In cases involving the reporting of sensitive information related to national security Congress has balanced the competing interests of keeping lawmakers informed while safeguarding secrets. For example the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 encourages employees of the Intelligence Community to contact Congress but only through the Intelligence Committees. Introduction Agency whistleblowers operate within a system of mixed messages. On the one hand the Code of Ethics adopted by Congress in 1958 directs all government employees to """"expose corruption wherever discovered."""" Over the years agency employees have received credit for revealing problems of defense cost overruns unsafe nuclear power plant conditions questionable drugs approved for marketing contract illegalities and improprieties and regulatory corruption. On the other hand exposing corruption can result in their being fired transferred reprimanded denied promotion or harassed. In 1978 a Senate panel found that the fear of reprisal """"renders intra-agency communications a sham and compromises not only the employee management and the Code of Ethics but also the Constitutional function of congressional oversight itself.""""

"(OSINT): Issues for Congress CRS report number: RL34270 Author(s): Richard A. Best Jr. and Alfred Cumming Foreign Affairs Defense and Trade Division Date: January 28 2008 Abstract Open source information (OSINT) is derived from newspapers journals radio and television and the Internet. Intelligence analysts have long used such information to supplement classified data but systematically collecting open source information has not been a priority of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). In recent years given changes in the international environment there have been calls from Congress and the 9/11 Commission among others for a more intense and focused investment in open source collection and analysis. However some still emphasize that the primary business of intelligence continues to be obtaining and analyzing secrets.

"History Status and Emerging Management Issues CRS report number: RL33494 Author(s): Harold C. Relyea Government and Finance Division Date: February 11 2008 Abstract The security classification regime in use within the federal executive branch traces its origins to armed forces information protection practices of the World War I era. The classification system - designating information according to prescribed criteria and procedures protected in accordance with one of three levels of sensitivity based on the amount of harm to the national security that would result from its disclosure - attained a presidential character in 1940 when President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued the initial executive order prescribing these information security arrangements. Refinements in the creation management and declassification of national security information followed over the succeeding decades and continue today. In many regards these developments represent attempts to narrow the bases and discretion for assigning official secrecy to executive branch documents and materials. Limiting the quantity of security classified information has been thought to be desirable for a variety of important reasons: (1) promoting an informed citizenry (2) effectuating accountability for government policies and practices (3) realizing oversight of government operations and (4) achieving efficiency and economy in government management.

Other current or proposed legislation also relates to the intersection between intellectual property and homeland security including the Invention Secrecy Act and a proposed patent extension for firms that develop anti-terrorism technologies.

"Energy: Issues for Congress CRS report number: RL31988 Author(s): Alfred Cumming Foreign Affairs Defense and Trade Division Date: October 23 2008 Abstract The value of polygraph testing with its associated uncertainties has been a part of Congress's continuing oversight interest for DOE. This report examines how DOE's polygraph testing program has evolved and reviews certain scientific findings with regard to the polygraph's scientific validity. Several issues include whether: DOE's new screening program is focused on an appropriate number of individuals occupying only the most sensitive positions; the program should be expanded in order to adequately safeguard certain classified information; further research into the polygraph's scientific validity is needed; there are possible alternatives to the polygraph; and whether DOE should continue polygraph screening. Possible options include a more focused polygraph screening program an expanded polygraph program additional research into the polygraph's scientific validity and eliminating the use of the polygraph to screen applicants and employees.

"zens as Enemy Combatants CRS report number: RL31724 Author(s): Jennifer K. Elsea American Law Division Date: March 31 2005 Abstract This report provides background information regarding the cases of two U.S. citizens deemed """"enemy combatants"""" Yaser Esam Hamdi who has been returned to Saudi Arabia and Jose Padilla who remains in military custody. A brief introduction to the law of war pertinent to the detention of different categories of individuals is offered followed by brief analyses of the main legal precedents invoked to support the President's actions as well as Ex parte Milligan which some argue supports the opposite conclusion. A discussion of U.S. practice during wartime to detain persons deemed dangerous to the national security follows including legislative history that may help to shed light on Congress' intent in authorizing the use of force to fight terrorism. The report concludes that historically even during declared wars additional statutory authority has been seen as necessary to validate the detention of citizens not members of any armed forces casting in some doubt the argument that the power to detain persons arrested in a context other than actual hostilities is necessarily implied by an authorization to use force.

"Background and Current Issues CRS report number: RS22577 Author(s): Carl Ek Foreign Affairs Defense and Trade Division Date: July 12 2007 Abstract On January 1 2007 Romania was formally admitted into the European Union. The accession marked a major milestone for the country which has been struggling through a difficult lengthy transition from communism and the 24-year era of oppressive rule under Nicolae Ceausescu. In 2004 national elections the center-right captured a majority in parliament along with the presidency. Over the past two years however there has been a great deal of infighting among the governing coalition partners. Observers believe that the parties held together out of a common desire to achieve EU membership. Now that EU entry is an accomplished fact some believe Romania may face early elections. A May 19 referendum on Traian Basescu's presidency engineered by the opposition-dominated parliament not only failed to dislodge him from his post it reaffirmed public support for the popular reformist. Relations between Romania and the United States have been close. Bucharest has cooperated with the Bush Administration in the war on terrorism and is providing troops in both Afghanistan and Iraq. In December 2005 the two countries signed an agreement granting the United States permission to establish military bases in Romania.

They are a product of the President making the choice the state of the Senate at the time the nominee and his or her views and the prevailing mood of the country.

After several months a ruling coalition consisting of three populist-nationalist parties was formed; the presidency and prime minister's post are held by Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski identical twin brothers who have increasingly consolidated their power. Their government's nationalist policies have caused controversy domestically in both the political and economic arenas and in foreign relations as well.

"(s): Jennifer K. Elsea American Law Division Date: December 21 2006 Abstract Recent incidents involving """"leaks"""" of classified information have heightened interest in the legal framework that governs security classification access to classified information and penalties for improper disclosure. Classification authority has generally rested with the executive branch although Congress has enacted legislation regarding the protection of certain sensitive information. While the Supreme Court has stated that the President has inherent constitutional authority to control access to sensitive information relating to the national defense or to foreign affairs no court has found that Congress is without authority to legislate in this area.

"Y2006 Appropriations for Border and Transportation Security CRS report number: RL33049 Author(s): Jennifer E. Lake and Blas Nunez-Neto Domestic Social Policy Division Date: August 24 2005 Abstract Increasing border and transportation security are essential strategies for improving and maintaining homeland security. Border security entails regulating the flow of goods and people across the nation's borders so that dangerous and unwanted goods or people are detected and denied entry. Transportation security entails screening and protecting people and goods as they move between different locations within the country. Determining which goods and people are permitted and which are denied entry into the United States involves a system of sophisticated border management. This system must balance the need for securing the nation's borders with facilitating the essential commerce and legitimate free flow of citizens and authorized visitors. The system must be capable of a detailed examination of the goods and people seeking entry but must still fit within budgetary constraints and be administratively feasible. Improving transportation security has meant an expanded federal role in screening passengers and baggage traveling through airports and also increasing the presence of federal officers aboard domestic and international flights. Plans exist to expand the presence of federal officers in other modes of transportation. Finally these management systems must accomplish their functions with a minimum of disruption of legitimate activities and without unnecessary intrusion into the civil liberties of persons affected by them.

The instruments used by Presidents in these regards have come to be known by various names and some have prescribed forms and purposes. Executive orders and proclamations are probably two of the best-known types largely because of their long-standing use and publication in the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations. Others are less familiar some because they are cloaked in official secrecy. There is as well the oral presidential directive the sense of which is captured in an announcement that records what the President has prescribed or instructed.

"Nonproliferation and Threat Reduction Assistance: U.S. Programs in the Former Soviet Union CRS report number: 31657 Author(s): Amy F. Woolf Date: March 26 2008 Abstract Congress passed the Nunn-Lugar amendment authorizing U.S. threat reduction assistance to the former Soviet Union in November 1991 after a failed coup in Moscow and the disintegration of the Soviet Union raised concerns about the safety and security of Soviet nuclear weapons. The annual program has grown from $400 million in the DOD budget around $1.1 billion across three agencies -- DOD DOE and the State Department. It has also evolved from an emergency response to impending chaos in the Soviet Union to a more comprehensive threat reduction and nonproliferation effort to a broader program seeking to keep nuclear chemical and biological weapons from leaking out of the former Soviet Union and into the hands of rogue nations or terrorist groups. The Department of Defense manages the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program which provides Russia Ukraine Belarus and Kazakhstan with assistance in transporting storing and dismantling nuclear chemical and biological weapons. U.S. assistance has helped these nations eliminate the delivery systems for nuclear weapons under the START I Treaty secure weapons storage areas construct a storage facility for nuclear materials removed from weapons construct a destruction facility for chemical weapons and secure biological weapons materials. The State Department manages the International Science and Technology Centers in Moscow and Kiev. These centers provide research grants to scientists and engineers so that they will not sell their knowledge to other nations or terrorist groups. The State Department has also provided assistance with export and border control programs in the former Soviet states. The Department of Energy manages programs that seek to improve the security of nuclear materials at civilian naval and nuclear weapons complex facilities.

"Hong Kong: Ten Years After the Handover CRS report number: RL34071 Author(s): Michael F.

There has been a sharp decline in Hong Kong's ex-patriot (""""ex-pat') community including U.S. nationals. Also there is a perception that Hong Kong's """"middle class"""" is disappearing. Underlying many of these social and cultural trends is a redefinition of Hong Kong by its residents indicating a closer identification with China. At present few of these long-term trends have had a significant effect on Hong Kong's political or economic situation and its relations with the United States. Under the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (PL102-383) the United States treats Hong Kong as a separate entity in a variety of political and economic areas so long as the HKSAR remains """"sufficiently autonomous"""" from China.

"441 Author(s): Charles Doyle and Brian T. Yeh American Law Division Date: February 3 2006 Abstract The Before the USA PATRIOT Act federal authorities engaged in gathering foreign intelligence information or conducting an investigation of international terrorism could seek a FISA court order for access to hotel airline storage locker and car rental business records. Section 215 amended the procedure so that in a foreign intelligence or international terrorism investigation federal authorities may obtain a FISA order for access to any tangible item no matter who holds it including by implication library loan records and the records of library computer use. Although past practices have apparently made the library community apprehensive the extent to which the authority of Section 215 has been used if at all is unclear. Media accounts of federal investigations involving library patrons ordinarily do not distinguish between simple inquiries grand jury subpoenas criminal search warrants FISA physical search orders and FISA tangible item orders. Moreover the Justice Department has indicated that as of March 30 2005 the authority under Section 215 had been exercised on 35 occasions but had not been used in any instance to secure library bookstore gun sale or medical records.

"835 Author(s): L. Elaine Halchin Government and Finance Division Date: April 10 2007 Abstract For security and other reasons the President Vice President and First Lady use military aircraft when they travel. The White House generally categorizes the trips as fulfilling either official or political functions. Often a trip involves both official and political or unofficial activities. When a trip is for an official function the government pays all costs including per diem (food and lodging) car rentals and other incidental expenses. When a trip is for political or unofficial purposes those involved must pay for their own food and lodging and other related expenses and they must also reimburse the government with the equivalent of the airfare that they would have paid had they used a commercial airline. When a trip involves both official and political activities a formula determines the amount to be reimbursed for that part of the trip involving political activities. Whether a trip is for official or political purposes the Air Force pays all operational and other costs incurred by the use of the aircraft. While the travel policies of specific Administrations concerning the reimbursement of expenses for unofficial travel generally are not publicly available it appears that policy guidelines developed by the Reagan White House have served as a basis for the travel policies of subsequent Administrations.

Colombia Bolivia and Peru collectively produce nearly the entire global supply of cocaine. In addition Colombia has become a producer of high quality heroin most of it destined for the United States and Europe. The United States provides counternarcotics assistance through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI). The program supports a number of missions including interdiction of drug trafficking illicit crop eradication alternative development and rule of law and democracy promotion. From FY2000 through FY2005 the United States has provided a total of about $4.3 billion in ACI funds. Since 2001 coca cultivation in the Andes has been reduced by 22% with the largest decrease occurring in Colombia according to the State Department. Opium poppy crops grown mainly in Colombia and from which heroin is made have been reduced by 67%. However the region was still capable of producing 640 metric tons of cocaine and 3.8 metric tons of heroin in 2004 according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. Congress has expressed a number of concerns with regard to eradication especially the health and environmental effects of aerial spraying its sustainability and social consequences and the reliability of drug crop estimates.

Congress retains a continuing oversight role in its implementation. CWC advocates continue to express concerns over so-called treaty-breaking sections of the implementing legislation and lobby for their amendment. Of particular concern are provisions that allow the President to block challenge inspections and that prohibit inspectors from sending chemical samples outside the United States for analysis. Supporters however believe that blocking a challenge inspection violates a basic premise of the convention and that forcing inspectors analysis to be conducted within the United States undermines confidence in the verification regime.

"Extraterritorial Application of American Criminal Law CRS report number: 94-166 Author(s): Charles Doyle American Law Division Date: September 10 2007 Abstract Crime is ordinarily proscribed tried and punished according to the laws on the place where it occurs. American criminal law applies beyond the geographical confines of the United States however under some limited circumstances. The federal exceptions to the general rule usually involve crimes like drug trafficking terrorism or crimes committed aboard a ship or airplane. State prosecution for overseas misconduct is limited almost exclusively to multijurisdictional crimes i.e. crimes where some elements of the offense are committed within the state and others are committed abroad. The Constitution Congress and state law define the circumstances under which American criminal law may be used against crimes occurring in whole or in part outside the United States.

For example Jay Cochran of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University reported that between 1948 and 2001 when the party in control of the White House changed the number of pages printed in the Federal Register increased an average of 17% during the final three months of an outgoing administration when compared to the number of pages during the same period in non-election years. Susan Dudley the current administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) wrote in 2001 (while a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center) that the sharp increase in regulatory output at the end of the Clinton Administration was """"not an anomaly"""" and that """"sudden bursts of regulatory activity at the end of a presidential administration are systematic significant and cut across party lines.

This report briefly outlines three such issues and touches upon some of the perspectives reflected in the ongoing debate. These issues include the inherent and often dynamic tension between national security and civil liberties particularly rights of privacy and free speech; the need for the intelligence community to be able to efficiently and effectively collect foreign intelligence information from the communications of foreign persons located outside the United States in a changing fast-paced and technologically sophisticated international environment or from United States persons abroad and the differing approaches suggested to meet this need; and limitations of liability for those electronic communication service providers who furnish aid to the federal government in its foreign intelligence collection. Two constitutional provisions in particular are implicated in this debate - the Fourth and First Amendments. This report briefly examines these issues and sets them in context.

However ties have been complicated by deep political and economic instability in the wake of the September 2006 coup that displaced Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. After December 2007 parliamentary elections returned many of Thaksin's supporters to power the U.S. government lifted the restrictions on aid imposed after the coup and worked to restore bilateral ties. But the government's authority remains tenuous and questions remain on how relations will fare as Bangkok seeks political stability.

Several bills would grant the FDA the ability to order recalls of food and other products. The Food and Drug Import Safety Act of 2007 H.R. 3610 would grant the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) the authority to require food recalls. Representative Dingell's draft of the Food and Drug Administration Globalization Act of 2008 - posted for comment on the House Energy and Commerce Committee website - would also grant the Secretary the authority to require food recalls and in addition would grant the Secretary the same authority for recalling drugs as the Secretary has for recalling devices. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act S. 625/H.R. 1108 would provide the Secretary with the authority to require recalls of tobacco products. Other bills that would provide the FDA with recall authority include the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act S. 3385; the Human and Pet Food Safety Act of 2007 S. 1274/H.R. 2108; the Safe Food Act of 2007 S. 654/H.R. 1148; the Protect Consumers Act of 2007 H.R. 2099; the Safe And Fair Enforcement and Recall for (SAFER) Meat Poultry and Food Act of 2007 H.R. 3484; the Food and Product Responsibility Act of 2007 S. 2081; the Consumer Food Safety Act of 2007 H.R. 3624; and the Food Import Safety Act of 2007 H.R. 3937.

"How Will the IMF Selects Its New Managing Director? (2004) CRS report number: RS21810 Author(s): Martin A. Weiss and Jonathan Sanford Foreign Affairs Defense and Trade Division Date: April 13 2004 Abstract The issue of selection of IMF (and other international financial institutions) has been heightened by the resignation of IMF Managing Director Horst Kohler. Controversy focuses on whether a 60-year-old convention reserving the IMF leadership for a European (and the World Bank for a U.S. citizen) is adequate for the current global economy. Proposals for a more open and transparent leadership selection process have been made although it appears that the current selection process will follow the traditional procedure. Nonetheless reform of the process is of active concern and will likely arise again in 2005 with the selection of a new World Bank president. This report discusses the traditional process and proposals for reform.

The United States and other countries condemned the test and the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1718 on October 14 which requires North Korea to refrain from nuclear or missile tests rejoin the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and dismantle its WMD programs. The test is the latest provocative act of many since 2002 when North Korea ended an eight-year freeze on its plutonium production program expelled international inspectors and restarted facilities. North Korea may now have enough Pu for eight to ten weapons. On February 13 2007 North Korea reached an agreement with other members of the Six- Party talks to begin the initial phase (60 days) of implementing the Joint Statement from September 2005 on denuclearization.

This report delves into border inspections from the perspectives of the three major types of inspections: immigration customs and animal and plant health. The transfer of these functions to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) marks a significant policy shift concerning all of these functions clarifying that although there are important commercial economic health humanitarian and immigration responsibilities ensuring the security of our borders is the top priority. The decision by DHS officials to further integrate the inspection duties so that there is one face at the border now means that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspectors are essentially interchangeable and responsible for all primary inspections.

"Government Information in the United States CRS report number: 97-71 Author(s): Harold C.

Nonetheless Congress has legislated various public access laws. These include two records access statutes - the Freedom of Information Act (FOI Act or FOIA; 5 U.S.C. � 552) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. � 552a) - and two meetings access statutes - the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA; 5 U.S.C. App.) and the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. � 552b). Moreover due to the American separation of powers model of government interbranch conflicts over the accessibility of information are neither unexpected nor necessarily destructive. The federal courts historically have been reluctant to review and resolve """"political questions"""" involving information disputes between Congress and the executive branch. Although there is considerable interbranch cooperation such conflicts probably will continue to occur on occasion.

"Hamas: Conflict in Gaza (2008-2009) CRS report number: R40101 Author(s): Jim Zanotti Coordinator Analyst in Middle Eastern Affairs Date: January 15 2009 Abstract The Gaza crisis constitutes a conundrum for all involved. Israel would like to avoid a drawn-out invasion and occupation of Gaza but at the same time does not want to abandon the military operation without assurance that the end result will leave Israelis more secure from rocket attacks. Although the ground attack might endanger its rule in Gaza Hamas may welcome it in the hopes of miring Israeli forces in close-quarters combat to strip away their advantages in technology and firepower and in hopes of heightening perceptions that Palestinians are being victimized. Linking the cessation of violence in and around Gaza with international enforcement of a truce or a broader regional security initiative may be possible but at present no proposed solution appears straightforward.

The House also adopted H.Res. 435 in November 2007 that emphasized the importance of eliminating Hezbollah's financial network in the tri-border area of South America. The House version of the FY2009 Intelligence Authorization Act H.R. 5959 included a provision requiring a Central Intelligence Agency report on human rights violations committed by Argentine military and security forces during the military dictatorship (1976-1983). In September 2008 a bill was introduced H.R. 7205 that would bar access to U.S. capital markets to foreign states that fail to satisfy U.S. court judgments and specifically cited Argentina as an egregious example. The Senate version of the FY2009 agriculture appropriations bill S. 3289 contained a provision prohibiting funds from being used for the importation of fresh meat from Argentina until the Secretary of Agriculture certifies to Congress that every region of Argentina is free of foot and mouth disease; the provision was not included in the FY2009 continuing appropriations resolution.

"Venue: A Brief Look at Federal Law Governing Where a Federal Crime May Be Tried CRS report number: RS22361 Author(s): Charles Doyle American Law Division Date: January 6 2006 Abstract Federal law promises criminal defendants a proper venue i.e. trial in the district in which the federal crime was committed. A crime is committed in any district in which any of its """"conduct"""" elements are committed. Some offenses are committed entirely within a single district; there they must be tried. Others begin in one district and are completed in another. They may be tried where they occur unless Congress has limited the choice of venue for the particular offense. Conspiracy may be tried in any district in which an overt act in its furtherance is committed at least when the commission of an overt act is an element of the conspiracy statute at issue. Crimes committed beyond the territorial confines of the United States are usually tried in the district into which the accused is first brought. The court may grant a change of venue at the behest of the defendant to avoid undue prejudice for the convenience of the parties or for sentencing purposes.

No treatment or prophylaxis currently exist though research into new therapies and vaccines against ricin exposure continues. Additionally research to improve ricin detectors is ongoing. Although the potential of ricin as a military weapon was investigated it has predominantly been used in small quantities against specific individuals. Most experts believe that ricin would be difficult to use as a weapon of mass destruction but do not discount its potential as a weapon of terror.

"'s Political Status: Historical Background and Ongoing Implications CRS report number: RS22388 Author(s): Kerry Dumbaugh Foreign Affairs Defense and Trade Division Date: February 23 2006 Abstract In 1979 official U.S. relations with Taiwan (the Republic of China) became a casualty of the American decision to recognize the communist government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as China's sole legitimate government. Since then U.S. unofficial relations with Taiwan have been built on the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act (P.L. 96-8) and shaped by three U.S.-China communiques. Under these agreements the United States maintains its official relations with the PRC while selling Taiwan military weapons and having extensive economic political and security interests there. But continuing transformations in both the PRC and Taiwan political systems mean U.S. officials are facing new and more difficult policy choices. This report intended as a background overview briefly summarizes U.S. political history with Taiwan and discusses the complications it has for current U.S. policy and for congressional actions.

Various members of the committee have notified the nominee of their intention to question him at the hearings regarding his views on a wide range of legal and constitutional issues and on the soundness of past Supreme Court rulings. Unwillingness by Judge Roberts to be forthcoming in answering their questions they have said might prompt them to vote against confirmation. In hearings before the Judiciary Committee in 2003 on his nomination to be a U.S. appellate court judge Roberts (then a private attorney) declined in response to repeated requests by some Senators on the committee to critique past Court rulings and disclose personal views about various topical legal and constitutional issues.

"5 Author(s): Michael V. Seitzinger American Law Division Date: September 2 2004 Abstract The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 was enacted principally to prevent corporate bribery of foreign officials. This act had three major parts: 1. It required the keeping by corporations of accurate books records and accounts; 2. It required issuers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to maintain a responsible internal accounting control system; and 3. It prohibited bribery by American corporations of foreign officials. For a number of years after passage of the act Congress debated amending it in response to numerous criticisms. On August 23 1988 the President signed into law the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 of which Title V is known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Amendments of 1988. The Amendments maintained the three major parts of the 1977 Act but significant changes were made. One of these changes enacted a knowing standard in order to find violations of the act. This standard was intended to encompass conscious disregard and willful blindness. The amendments provided certain defenses against finding violations of the act such as that the gift is lawful under the laws of the foreign country and that the gift is a bona fide and reasonable expenditure or for the performance or execution of a contract with the foreign government. In 1998 the act was further amended in order to implement the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. These amendments expanded the scope of coverage to include some foreign persons and extended jurisdiction beyond the borders of the United States.

Shimabukuro American Law Division Date: February 9 2005 Abstract On February 1 2005 final regulations to implement a new human resources management system for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were published. The regulations provide for the organization of the new personnel system describing among other topics the use of pay bands how jobs will be evaluated and how pay will be administered. In addition subpart E of the final regulations defines the departments labor relations system. This report compares the provisions of the final regulations with similar provisions from title 5 chapter 71 of the U.S. Code. Although the collective bargaining rights for employees of DHS will be subject to the new regulations such rights for most federal employees are otherwise governed by 5 U.S.C. chapter 71. While some of the differences involve simply a change in diction other changes are more significant. The establishment of a Homeland Security Labor Relations Board that will perform many of the duties otherwise undertaken by the Federal Labor Relations Authority as well as a redefining of what constitutes certain unfair labor practices are examples of these more noteworthy changes.

"6 Elections and Issues for Congress CRS report number: RS22430 Author(s): Maureen Taft-Morales Foreign Affairs Defense and Trade Division Date: July 13 2006 Abstract Former President Alan Garcia continued his political comeback by being elected President on June 4 2006 defeating populist Ollanta Humala. Not only the winning candidate will have an impact on U.S. relations with Peru: lacking a majority in the newly-elected Congress Garcia will have to negotiate with the other parties to pass his program. Garcia generally favors free market policies. Humala campaigned on an antiglobalization platform; his alliance won the largest bloc in the legislature but is splintering before the legislators are even sworn in. Municipal and regional elections will be held on November 19. Other issues in U.S.-Peruvian relations include trade drugs democracy and human rights. The two countries signed a free trade agreement. The Peruvian legislature ratified it in June; the U.S. Congress has held hearings and may vote on the agreement before fall elections.

"Based Upon Groundbreaking Supreme Court Decisions in Criminal Law CRS report number: RL32613 Author(s): Paul Starett Wallace Jr. American Law Division Date: September 28 2004 Abstract One of the hallmarks of new Supreme Court decisions is that until their announcement many of the lower courts are likely to have ruled erroneously on the issue. The question becomes when may defendants convicted or sentenced on the basis of these errors claim the benefit of the new decision and have their convictions or sentences overturned. Generally new decisions of the Supreme Court will apply retroactively to defendants currently on trial or on direct appeal. Also a defendant may take advantage retroactively of a new Court rule in a few other limited situations for example decisions which construe a criminal statute to exclude certain acts or conduct. New decisions of the Court sometimes apply retroactively to those on collateral review and rarely apply retroactively to those petitioners on second or successive collateral reviews.

"Homeland Security Intelligence: Perceptions Statutory Definitions and Approaches CRS report number: RL33616 Author(s): Mark A. Randol Specialist in Domestic Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism Date: January 14 2009 Abstract This report provides a potential conceptual model of how to frame HSINT including geographic structural/statutory and holistic approaches. Given that state local tribal and private sector officials play such an important role in HSINT the holistic model one not constrained by geography or levels of government strikes many as the most compelling. The report argues that there is in effect a Homeland Security Intelligence Community (HSIC). Although the HSIC's members are diffused across the nation they share a common counterterrorism interest. The proliferation of intelligence and information fusion centers across the country indicate that state and local leaders believe there is value to centralizing intelligence gathering and analysis in a manner that assists them in preventing and responding to local manifestations of terrorist threats to their people infrastructure and other assets. At the policy and operational levels the communication and integration of federal HSINT efforts with these state and local fusion centers will likely remain an important priority and future challenge.

The order was prompted by changing security conditions in the aftermath of the end of the cold war and a desire for more economical and effective management of classified information. The directive was modified in late March 2003 by E.O. 13292 issued by President George W. Bush. Largely prescribed in a series of successive presidential executive orders issued over the past 50 years security classification policy and procedure provide the rationale and arrangements for designating information officially secret for reasons of national security and for its declassification as well.
