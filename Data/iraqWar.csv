" On Wednesday, January 29, Commissioner Aaron Demerson of the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) presented DynCorp International (DI) the “We Hire Vets” award in recognition for its commitment to hiring veterans. The “We Hire Vets” employer recognition program, a partnership between the TWC, Texas Veterans Commission (TVC) and Texas Workforce Solutions, was launched in 2017 to recognize Texas employers for their commitment to hiring veterans and to provide Texas workers who are veterans with a direct link to employment opportunities. Texas is home to more than 565,000 employers and 2.6 million small businesses, and there are 1.7 million veterans in Texas. The program allows employers to apply for the recognition or be nominated by a local workforce development board or TVC partner. “I am excited to celebrate DynCorp International for their efforts in hiring our nation’s heroes,” said TWC Commissioner Representing Employers Aaron Demerson. “With 42 percent of its Texas workforce made up of veterans, DynCorp is ensuring our veterans have the opportunity to experience the same pride and purpose they had while serving.” “The Texas Veterans Commission recognizes companies for focusing on veteran employment,” said Thomas Palladino, TVC executive director. “Because hiring veterans is not good will, it’s good for business.” DI’s Dianne Walker, Human Resources senior vice president and Fred Littleton, Recruiting director received the award on behalf of DI. “Approximately 60 percent of our global workforce are veterans,” said Dianne Walker. “DI has a proud and longstanding legacy of hiring veteran employees.” “In 2019 we hired 483 employees in Texas, more than half of which were veterans,” said Fred Littleton. “Not only do vets bring the skills needed to perform our job requirements, they also help build up our company with values, honor and a mindset of service.”",Public
" In April 2019, a DynCorp International (DI) team from the Patuxent River Naval Air Station program traveled to Ingalls Field in Hot Springs, Virginia, to test the Distributed Aperture Infrared Countermeasure (DAIRCM) system in AH-1Z and MH-60S aircraft. The objective of the detachment was to evaluate the DAIRCM, an improved missile countermeasure system, to determine if the system’s performance was ready for the next phase of testing and fielding. In addition to DI maintenance, the detachment team consisted of about 30 people from NAVAIR, Atlantic Test Range and the Center for Countermeasures, among others. Ingalls Field is an excellent airfield to test with very little traffic on the tip-top of a mountain with terrain sharply dropping off into valleys to the east and west. A challenge that comes with testing on the top of a mountain where field elevation is 3,790 feet, however, is the weather. During the April detachment, the weather varied from 75 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny to driving rain and dense fog with temps barely climbing out of the 40’s. Of course, the day when the MH-60 was due for a full round of torque checks the team was battling heavy rain and visibility down to 100 feet. Although major maintenance was completed on the aircraft prior to detachment, subsequent torque checks on every fastener and driveshaft coupling from the main transmission to the intermediate gearbox were required. This covers a lot of bolts, most of which are very difficult to access, requiring the DI maintainers to contort on top and sometimes inside the aircraft. “Maintenance like this is no small task in the dry hangar back home at Patuxent River,” said Charlie Grogan, DynAviation Navy lead. “Yet our maintenance team executed on the flight line, on the top of a mountain, in the driving elements.” While the rest of the detachment planned the next flight events or analyzed data from the comforts of the hotel, the DI team worked for a full day in the driving rain. Through dedication, skill and resolve, the team got the job done and returned the aircraft to an up status for test execution the next day. The weather cleared, the MH-60 flew, and the detachment team was able to successfully collect and deliver the needed data to bring a more capable system to the fleet. “The magnitude of the work performed by the DI maintenance personnel in the elements and the attitude with which they met their task stands out as a highlight of our time on the mountain,” said a U.S. Navy lieutenant from the detachment.",Public
" Navigating the various permissions and licenses to operate in a foreign country can be daunting. DynCorp International’s Afghanistan Operations team is a group of eleven employees that support almost all our programs in Afghanistan. Their special support ranges across many different areas including Security, Personal Security Transport (PST), Tax, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan (MoFA), Administration, and Visa/Liaison support. Much of their work allows the programs in Afghanistan to meet the rule of Afghan law and to ensure that the laws and rules are applied properly and correctly. These team members interact with the various Afghan ministries, ensuring visas and MoFA reference numbers are delivered and processed on time and that comprehensive tax situations are dealt with accurately and correctly. Additionally, the team, led by security director Glen Lewis, ensures that whenever there is an incident, timely and accurate information is disseminated across all channels and levels of DynCorp International. One of the most important challenges this team faces is renewing the Services International LLC/Risk Management Company (SIL/RMC) license each year. Without the license or a letter bridging to the next license, a company can no longer provide RMC services to its customers – in short, the company cannot conduct certain types of business in Afghanistan. Mr. Zubair Wahabzai, the Visa/Government Liaison specialist, took on this difficult challenge even after the Ministry of Interior Counterterrorism Department (MoICT) insisted it would not be willing to give any type of bridging letters to any RMC companies in Afghanistan. After multiple trips around the city of Kabul, including daily trips to the MoICT Department to meet with very senior leaders, his constant engagement, coupled with a lot of finesse, resulted in DynCorp International receiving the very first, highly sought-after bridging letter.",Public
" On the Naval Test Wing Pacific (NTWP) program at Point Mugu, California, DynCorp International (DI) employee Wilfredo “Willie” Dumaop performed his routine foreign object debris (FOD) sweep of Bloodhound 303 of the U.S. Navy Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 30 (VX-30). “It was just another routine FOD sweep,” said Willie, DI Quality Assurance (QA) representative. “Then I noticed something hidden behind the pilot’s rudder pedals.” Mr. Dumaop discovered a critical piece of foreign debris, a Stratus inverter power plug, behind the pedals. “Without his diligent efforts and attention to detail, this piece of equipment could have easily fouled vital safety of flight controls resulting in significant damage or even loss of life,” said the U.S. Navy VX-30 Maintenance Officer. “Mr. Dumaop found this missing piece of equipment even before the aircrew or duty officer were able to communicate the potential of hard FOD being adrift in the cockpit or even on the aircraft.” “Willie Dumaop displayed an exemplary commitment to the ideals of safe and effective maintenance, which are the foundation of Naval Aviation,” continued the maintenance officer. “His actions display an example for all to emulate.” For his achievements to improving safety, Mr. Dumaop received a VX-30 Safety Professional award. “I’m proud of Willie for his commitment to safety and his attention to detail, and would like to congratulate him for this most deserved award,” said Bob Sanford, Point Mugu assistant site manager and QA director. About DI’s NTWP Program: DI provides organizational-level aircraft maintenance and logistics support on aircraft, systems/subsystems, aircrew systems, SAR equipment, and Support Equipment (SE) for assigned aircraft (rotary, fixed, lighter-than-air, unmanned), aircraft on-site for project testing, transient aircraft, FMS aircraft, loaner aircraft, training aircraft, and leased aircraft.

" Over the last decade, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) has received more than $1.3 million dollars of support through DynCorp International (DI) employee and corporate donations. The “Red Shirt Friday – Support the Troops” campaign alone has generated $135 thousand dollars in contributions from DI employees who purchased a red shirt to wear in support of the sacrifice of our servicemen and women throughout the world. DI’s Journey of Hope charity golf tournaments raised an additional $358 thousand through the sponsorships of DI suppliers, partners and employees. TAPS has supported many DI families since 2010, and in 2014, DI became the first private company to form an official partnership with TAPS to provide support to families of fallen DI personnel. Through this agreement, TAPS and DI’s Employee Assistance Program (EAP), designed to support DI employees and their families, work together to provide survivors of DI employees comfort and care through comprehensive services and programs including peer-based emotional support, case work assistance, connections to community-based care, and grief and trauma resources. DI has lost eighty-five teammates who were supporting U.S. foreign policy objectives. Watch Bonnie Carroll, TAPS founder and president, thank the people of DI in a brief, two-minute video. About TAPS The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) is the national organization providing compassionate care for the families of America’s fallen military heroes.

" DynCorp International (DI) has again earned the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Diamond Award for Excellence in recognition of its commitment to aviation maintenance training for Joint Base Andrews. The DI team at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland has earned this prestigious award 15 times. Through this program, DI provides services for the Very Important Person Special Air Mission (VIPSAM) including aircraft maintenance, munitions, base supply and fuels in support of aircraft assigned to the 11th Wing and 89th Airlift Wing. “This award is due entirely to the maintenance team’s dedication and hard work,” said Craig O’Neal, Andrews Support Division, division manager. “And, they’ve pulled this off an incredible 15 years in a row.” The Diamond Award is the highest corporate award and includes both individual and corporate recognition. The award recognizes completion by 100 percent of an organization’s eligible maintenance technicians of specialized, continuous training in aircraft systems, regulations and FAA rules over a 12-month period. In addition to the Diamond Award, which is presented to the company, each mechanic receives an Aviation Maintenance Technician award based on the number of training hours logged. “This is the last time that the team can compete for this award under the VIPSAM name since the contract was divided into five separate programs (Executive Airlift, Rotary Maintenance Wing, Supply and Fuels, Munitions, and Transient Alert) this year,” added Craig. “The team looks forward to continuing its truly amazing run of earning this prestigious award in the future under the Executive Airlift and Rotary Maintenance Wing service contracts.”",Public
" The DynCorp International (DI) teams may have had more fun playing tournaments with their mini-golf greens than constructing them! The results are in from July’s DynFun activity, a miniature golf course construction contest. Teams worked inventively to build an individual putt-putt hole to incorporate into a DI-wide virtual golf course spread throughout the globe. The team on LOGCAP’s NTC program in Fort Irwin, California, built a putt-putt hole symbolizing their base in the desert. It included course features representative of many elements of their location: the historical Painted Rocks near the main gate, the High Mobility, Multi-Purpose, Wheeled Vehicle that DI maintains, the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier that DI also maintains, the UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter to represent the DI Air Traffic Controllers, orange cones to represent the Vehicle Issue Yard and Rotational Unit Field Maintenance Area where vehicles are transferred to/from DI for test, repair & inspection, the ammunition can representing the Theatre Ammunition Supply Point, the brake rotor and exhaust pipe to represent other maintenance facilities, and finally, the cactus, donkeys and coyotes to represent the desert. The Accounts Payable team in Fort Worth, Texas went with a tropical luau party theme, featuring pool noodle guides, a tiki windmill, a metal filing rack tunnel, a pool float trap and a hibiscus flower ramp. They had an honor system on scorecards emphasizing fair play for their tournament prize. Alliance Security and Facilities in Fort Worth, Texas set up a Team dysFUNctional hole featuring an Edward Snowden and Leonard Moss starting tee with vintage cartoon burglars and insider threat ‘shadow man’ tube obstacles, with the finish in a DI Mailroom mailbox. At the McLean, Virginia office, team Corporate Security, Facilities & Real Estate created a carnival-game type putt-putt green with three alternative scoring options, the ultimate goal score being Security Superstar! They played the DI Security Open Mini Golf Tournament, which resulted in a four-way tie. A shootout was conducted among the winners, and Dorian Amstel resulted victorious with a Security Awareness medallion. Corporate Human Resources in Fort Worth, Texas, created green ‘Dyn O Mite’ with a prehistoric theme. The putt-putt hole featured an erupting volcano, plastic bin water feature with mini boulders, velociraptor and T-rex obstacles, tropical pterodactyl, and a whiteboard backdrop with dry-eraser artwork.

" This month, employees from DynCorp International’s (DI) McLean, Virginia and Fort Worth, Texas offices collected dresses, shoes and accessories to donate to the USO of Metropolitan Washington-Baltimore (USO-Metro). USO-Metro is a nonprofit organization chartered by Congress, and dedicated to “serving those who serve, and their families” in Washington D.C., Maryland and Northern Virginia. With the help of thousands of devoted volunteers, USO-Metro provides programs and services for active duty troops and their families at area military hospitals, USO Centers, USO airport lounges and a Mobile USO. Most branches of service have at least one anniversary ball or recognition “gala” each year. These special events can be intimidating and uncomfortable considering the etiquette and protocol associated with attending these functions. USO-Metro puts on a full day event, called Project Cinderella, which empowers women with interactive workshops on beauty and etiquette. It culminates with the women choosing from a selection of donated items, both a formal gown and accessories.

" DynCorp International (DI) hosted students from the National Defense University (NDU) at the McLean, Virginia office on Friday, April 12. The students are part of the National Defense University’s competitive Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy. The nearly year-long curriculum prepares select military officers and civilians for leadership roles and success in developing national security strategy. Graduates are taught skills that can be used to better evaluate, marshal, and manage resources in the execution of military strategies. Many graduates of the program go on to hold leadership positions throughout the government and become executives in industry. Topics varied from an overview of what DI does, to specific program details, to finance. One area of concentration was DynCorp International’s ability to stand up high-performing, rapid response teams that offer unique, tailored solutions. For example, there were questions about how DI approaches complex tasks like responding to natural disasters when resources can be scarce and needs are ever-changing. The group was also interested in learning how DI successfully implements large scale programs quickly while maintaining our high-quality standards and our companies’ core values. The seventeen scholars represented a diverse group with a wide array of experience and included members of U.S. Armed Forces, select inter-agency civilians, and representatives from Tanzania, Croatia, Italy, and Bosnia and Herzegovina armed forces. Attendees hold ranks in the military including Commanders, Lieutenants, Lieutenant Colonels and Colonels. The group heard from three presenters, Jim Cassella, SVP Business Development; Janet Oliver, SVP Business Development; and Robert Tillery, SVP Operations. We look forward

" Three service milestones were reached recently at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland on DynCorp International’s (DI) program servicing aircraft for the U.S. Navy. Celebrating 40 years of service were Steve Long and Walter Muenzel, and celebrating 45 years of service was Ethrage “Duck” Haggard. “DI has
serviced the U.S. Navy at Pax River continuously since 1973,” said Randy
Hughes, program manager. “Steve, Walter and Duck have played a significant role
in DI’s continued success at Pax. They have contributed to our long legacy of
providing unmatched dedicated service to our navy customer and are standout
examples of serving today for a better tomorrow with a combined 29,200 days of
service!”    Steve Long began his career at Dynalectron, DI’s predecessor company, in 1979 at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (TPS) at NAS Patuxent River. Steve started out maintaining T-2 aircraft and has since worked on A-4, U-6, NU-1B, X-26 and T-38 aircraft. Steve is currently the subject matter expert on the NU-1B and U-6 aircraft and has been very influential in training the next generation of aircraft mechanics as they support the school’s unique national assets. Steve holds an FAA Airframe and Power Plant (A&P) license and has received multiple letters of appreciation for his work to include one from the Naval Air Test and Evaluation Museum at Pax River and another from the commander of the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School while serving his 40-year tenure at TPS. Walter “Frank” Muenzel began his career at Dynalectron in 1979 at the U.S. Navy TPS as an aircraft mechanic after serving four years in the United States Marine Corps (USMC). While in the marines, Frank worked on F-4J aircraft and reached the rank of corporal. Early in the 1980’s Frank transferred to the ground support equipment shop where he maintains many different types of aviation support equipment for TPS. The Naval Air Test and Evaluation Museum at Pax River commended him in a letter of appreciation while serving his 40-year tenure at TPS. Frank’s family has a history of service to the nation – he was born in Germany where his father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force and his brother is retired from the USMC. Married to his wife Evelyn for more than 20 years, he has two daughters and a son. Ethrage “Duck” Haggard holds the distinction of having the longest current continued service within the company, having reached the 45-year milestone of DI service. Duck started his employment as a Contract Field Team aircraft mechanic on March 4, 1974 at Shaw AFB, South Carolina, and performed aircraft maintenance services at Honolulu, Hawaii, and Elmendorf, Alaska before taking a position at Patuxent River in 1975. Many of the aircraft Duck has maintained at Pax River are currently retired and being honorably displayed at the Pax Naval Air Museum. Currently serving as the business manager on the Naval Test Wing Atlantic program, Duck enjoys spending time with his grandson fishing and hunting. “Congratulations and a big THANK YOU on behalf of a very appreciative company,” said Joe Ford, DynAviation president. “These three gentlemen have reached an epic and extraordinary milestone in their years of service.”",Public
" Clifford Ruggles, program manager of DynCorp International’s (DI) Phoenix Consulting Group, recently traveled to Afghanistan to provide counter-elicitation training to DI’s Afghanistan National Army (ANA), Afghanistan National Police (ANP) and Afghanistan Life Support Services (ALiSS) programs in Kabul. A former U.S. Army interrogator and strategic debriefer who has been with the Phoenix Consulting Group since 2003, Mr. Ruggles focused his training primarily on teaching techniques for recognizing and countering information-gathering attempts by potential competitors, adversaries or anyone else seeking to gain insight into DI’s operations.  “Due to the fact that DI employees in Afghanistan routinely work alongside our competitors and interact daily with people from dozens of countries, the potential for unknowingly disseminating sensitive company information is high,” said Ruggles. ALiSS Food Service Operations Manager Robert Peters noted, “I thought that the class was very informative and should be a requirement. In contracting, especially overseas, there are numerous opportunities for employees to inadvertently pass along proprietary information. Being in a community such as this, most people are friendly with one another. What one person may think is a friendly conversation, another person may be trying to use the conversation to elicit or extract information that their company can use on proposals.” “It was an excellent class and Cliff Ruggles is an excellent instructor. You can tell that he has been doing it for a long time and it shows in his delivery, presentation, and his knowledge is off the charts,” commented Curtis Blasé, ANA/ANP director of Security and Operations. “Although the focus of these training events was primarily counter-elicitation, the Phoenix Consulting Group conducts a wide variety of training courses such as Advanced Crisis Negotiations, Business Intelligence, Strategic Debriefing of Law Enforcement Sources, Cognitive Interviewing, and others,” added Ruggles. Descriptions of these and other Phoenix course offerings can be found in their online brochure.

DCA Live: Biggest in-house trends/issues your law firm friends and colleagues should know about? Virginia: It’s important to keep in mind that your corporate client’s goals and needs are not stagnant – they change over time, sometimes quite quickly, based on a wide variety of constantly shifting internal and external pressures. Make sure you ask your clients about the current issues they are facing that might influence your handling of an otherwise seemingly unrelated matter. DCA Live: Your advice to a soon to graduate law school student? Virginia: Law firm jobs can be an important way to learn strong customer service skills, so starting your career in private practice can be a good idea, but keep an eye out for in-house opportunities before you get too senior in your career – you will find the work both challenging and rewarding.",Public
" This April, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul was recognized as a worldwide winner of the Greening Council’s Greening Diplomacy Initiative (GDI) Award for their recycling efforts in a critical-threat environment. DynCorp International currently provides waste management services under a task order on the Afghanistan Life Support Services (ALiSS) program, and has been leading the recycling efforts at the embassy. The annual GDI Awards recognize posts or offices that innovate to reduce their environmental footprint. This award was presented to Embassy Kabul for remaining committed to reducing their environmental footprint despite facing a constant critical-threat security environment with limited infrastructure. The embassy’s recycling program recycled 364,000 pounds of waste in 2017. Local partners turned the recycled materials into items such as plastic furniture, toilet paper, and dishes. This partnership expands private sector-led economic growth and provides employment alternatives to those at risk of radicalization and violent extremist messaging. The post also launched a campaign to discourage the use of bottled water, emphasizing that 100% of compound water is potable. Post’s Green Team and the ALiSS program issued water bottles and filters to 200 embassy personnel to help reduce bottled water usage.

DI manages recycling initiatives through our waste management subcontractor in Afghanistan. We recycled over 340 thousand pounds of plastic, cardboard and aluminum in 2017. Trash from the Embassy is sent to the recycling center where workers sort and separate the recyclables. Plastics are shredded into small fragments, aluminum cans are compressed into dense bales, and cardboard is pressed into more manageable sizes. The materials are then sent to other vendors that turn them into things like molded plastic furniture and toilet paper.   In addition to the regular recycling, DI has also partnered with another company to dispose of food waste generated through kitchen operations (e.g. preparation, leftovers, etc.) along with shredded paper.            ",Public

The aircraft was rescued from the Navy boneyard, stripped down to the bare metal, and modified with over 300 kits installed – including new wire harnesses, new turbine engines and a retardant tank addition to the center fuselage,” said Jeff Cavarra, CAL FIRE director. “We greatly appreciate him taking the time to come out and tour our operation.” While on site, George held an informal all-hands meeting to talk about relevant company information and answer questions. The program has been busy conducting ground and flight school training while maintenance technicians perform annual maintenance on all three CAL FIRE aircraft types – S-2, OV-10 and UH-1H. “The CAL FIRE program is a complex and extraordinary effort,” said CEO George Krivo. “There are more aircraft than I was expecting – it is truly impressive. They are doing outstanding and important work, maintaining these aircraft and executing critical lifesaving operations.”",Public
" In the words of author Stephen King, “Sooner or later, everything old is new again.” On January 25, Tanker 79 made its maiden flight after 22 months of work by DynCorp International (DI) mechanics on the CAL FIRE program in Sacramento, California. The aircraft flew for the first time since 1977, when it was retired by the U.S. Navy. DI opened the first Work Order on the aircraft in March of 2016.  “The project, dubbed Project X during the conceptual phase, took the aircraft to a barebones airframe and rebuilt it from there,” said Jeff Cavarra, CAL FIRE program director.“DI employees performed all of the work on the aircraft and were assisted by various other vendors who provided engineering and logistical support, and specialized services.”  The rebuilt aircraft included new wiring, structural improvements and modifications, removal of the torpedo bay, installation of the retardant tank, a refurbished hydraulic system, installation of a stand-alone retardant tank hydraulic operating system, modified and overhaul cockpit layout and features, and a new fuel system. It will be available for the 2018 fire season in California and is expected to be based in Hollister, California. The FAA DER flight test pilot who performed the first flight stated, “It was the most uneventful first flight that I ever remember having.” The aircraft will be flown for approximately 40-50 additional hours prior to being flown to Arizona for paint. “The success of Project X is a testament to the partnership that DI has with CAL FIRE,” continued Cavarra. “What an amazing accomplishment for these employees and an extraordinary story for DI.”",Public
" DynCorp International (DI) employees at the Alliance campus in Fort Worth, Texas raised $3085 in a charity raffle for Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) and the Wounded Warrior Project, and DI Corporate matched the amount raised, for a total of $6170. The winner received four roundtrip U.S. domestic airline ticket vouchers. The drawing was held at the Alliance holiday party for employees at the Texas Motor Speedway Club on Friday, December 1. “We wanted to support a great cause and foster an opportunity to give back while we celebrated a good year at DI,” said Jennifer Gallegos-Grumbles, senior security manager and holiday planning committee member. TAPS has supported many DI families since 2010, and DI is the first private company to form an official partnership with TAPS to provide support to families of fallen DI personnel.

" During the recent spate of Northern California fires, DynCorp International (DI) pilots on the state of California’s aerial firefighting program flew 700 hours in seven days, from October 9 through October 15, 2017. “Our pilots have to ramp up extraordinarily quickly,” said Jeff Cavarra, DI’s program director for CAL FIRE. “On October 9th alone, 149 flight hours were reached in less than a 24-hour period. To perform in such a professional manner after having a relatively quiet period prior to the firestorm really showcases the skill and ability of our pilots.” CAL FIRE as an agency, including state-owned air tankers and contracted air tankers, pumped 3,600,000 gallons of fire retardant in a two-week period. One DI pilot even made 21 drops on a fire in one seven-hour period, operating the aircraft in single-pilot configuration (which is much more demanding than dual-crewed). In addition to the flight hours and millions of gallons of retardant, CAL FIRE maintenance technicians kept the aircraft running. In a typical ‘fire bust,’ one or two air attack bases become the focal point, with many aircraft making trips to and from the fire. The recent wildfires engendered a different scenario. There were at least five air attack bases operating with numerous aircraft. The maintenance technicians were putting in long hours at all of these bases to make certain the aircraft were safe to fly. DI’s CAL FIRE crew at McClellan AFB supported the bases with additional mechanics and aircraft parts. “We dispatched several mechanics into the areas where fires were actively burning, like Santa Rosa and Chico,” said Jeff Cavarra. “We had to check if roads were open to allow them to get to the bases. These mechanics went to the bases knowing they may have to sleep on the floor as all of the local lodging was filled by evacuees.” “As usual, I am honored to call these people co-workers,” continued Jeff. “They performed flawlessly in spite of the overwhelming odds they faced from Mother Nature.”",Public

" DynCorp International’s Patrick Support Division (PSD) at Patrick Air Force Base held a food drive in June to support their local food pantry, the South Brevard Sharing Center (SBSC) in Melbourne, Florida. The local sites collected food and cash donations, and overseas employees donated money online. Due to a partnership with the Second Harvest Food Bank, the SBSC was able to purchase $5 worth of food for every $1 in donations. The cash donations totaled $820, which translated into $4,100 worth of food! Two huge car loads of canned goods and other non-perishable items were also donated. The volunteers at the center commented, “It’s because of companies like DynCorp International that we stay in business.” DynCorp International received a hearty thank you on the SBSC’s Facebook page. It was a great event to give back to the families in the community that surrounds the PSD sites in Florida. Summertime needs are great for food pantries as they see a huge increase in demand with children out of school.

Each team logged steps for the day during a nine-hour period and took photos to share. Last year’s winner was the LOGCAP IV team with just over 60,000 steps, and this year every team vied to beat that number. The Communications department got some healthy competitive chatter going on between teams in the days leading up to the walk. “Tillery’s team is going down,” said Mark Mirelez, AELS BU lead. “Between T-6 Combs, VIPSAM and ERRC, I know we can stomp LOGCAP’s record and get that Shoe trophy.” “We’re gonna walk all over Logistics and AELS” said Scott Rauer, AOLC lead. “Our RASM, TASM and INL Air Wing teams will not accept defeat.” Dianne Walker, vice president HR chimed in, “Our HR Center of Excellence (COE) is clearing a prime spot on our display shelf for the Shoe trophy we expect to host very soon.” With everyone pushing for the win, it was a day of fierce competition. “Win or lose, the INL Air Wing team had a great time contributing,” said Joe Dunaway, Air Wing lead. “It was a lot of good fun for all, especially as we walked all over Bubba’s team at more than 413 thousand steps total from our locations around the world.” “AOLC put in a stunning performance at more than 234 thousand steps from RASM, TASM and AFM/CFT combined,” said Scott Rauer, AOLC lead. “That’s not including INL Air Wing’s insane count. We totaled 647K!” “Our team AELS Fighting Falcons secured an incredible count of more than 489 thousand steps,” said Mark Mirelez, AELS lead. “We had a blast and hopefully one of our awesome teams secured the ‘Shoes’ trophy.” “Oh, amateurs,” said Rob Tillery, LG4 lead. “With 17 teams walking at Kandahar Airfield, FOB Shorab, FOB Dwyer and Alliance, Texas, LOGCAP totaled more than 605 thousand steps.” DI had teams ranging from only one person who tracked their steps all day to teams of 36 with every 15-minute spot filled. Here are the results! “Looks like Corporate IT snuck in for a surprise win!” said CEO Lou Von Thaer. “What a fantastic triumph, and a truly amazing amount of participation around the globe – rain, snow, sleet or shine!” “It’s great to see us come together as a company and do something fun, healthy and interactive for everyone,” continued Lou. “I look forward to more healthy challenges throughout the year.” Communications will deliver the Shoes trophy to the winning team and take a victory picture.

" It’s no secret that heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the United States. What is less known is that today’s youth make up the first American generation expected to have a shorter life expectancy than their parents. This is a troubling fact, but the good news is that the American Heart Association (AHA) is committed to reversing this trend by fighting heart disease and stroke. It does so, in part, through annual Heart Walks across the country. This is a cause I believe in. And it’s a fight we can win. That is why I am deeply gratified to serve as this year’s chair of the Greater Washington Heart Walk. To make sure we reach our goal of raising $2.5 million in Washington, I want to encourage other Washington-area companies and executives to get involved – whether that’s through serving on the Executive Committee, investing in this important event or sponsoring teams for the Walk. At my company, DynCorp International (DI), cardiovascular conditions account for our biggest health insurance costs and take a large human toll on the people we care for and depend upon. That’s true for most organizations, which should make involvement in the Heart Walk a natural choice for companies and their corporate responsibility programs. And chances are that companies will find other shared focuses with the AHA. At DI, where almost half of our workforce are veterans, supporting the U.S. military is a top priority. That’s true too for the AHA, through programs and alliances with veterans’ groups. Another goal of the AHA is to reverse the trend of childhood obesity. There are countless reasons to support this objective, but to name just one: doing so will improve the military’s recruiting efforts by fostering future generations of healthy individuals able to have the opportunity to serve. I am challenging my company to “get healthy” this year. The Greater Washington Heart Walk will be our starting point, not just by encouraging people to get more active, but by bringing additional awareness and education concerning heart disease to the attention of our team. At DI, we like to say “We serve today for a better tomorrow.” The work of the AHA is also aimed at securing a better tomorrow. Please consider supporting this important cause by forming a team and joining us on November 5th. Register today at www.GreaterWashingtonHeartWalk.org.

From the transmission overhaul shop to the flight line, he was impressed with the professionalism and knowledge demonstrated by everyone involved. “I was particularly excited by DI’s efforts to support CAL FIRE’s ‘Project X’ where we are working to completely regenerate and modify a retired S-2 aircraft from the stripped-down airframe to a brand new airtanker,” said Von Thaer. “The skills demonstrated and expertise gained will be invaluable to DI as we work to expand our capabilities and offerings to multiple customers.” Von Thaer concluded his visit with a stop at the Grass Valley Air Attack Base and got to witness firsthand the launch, return and reloading of the airtankers and support OV-10s. “While I always appreciated CAL FIRE’s work, it is hard to grasp the complexity and precision required for the mission until you see it in person,” he said.

" DynAviation held a contest in October 2015 to select a motto that would represent their commitment to employee safety. “We decided to go out-of-the-box on creativity,” said John Neville, Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) senior manager. “So, we opened the contest to any DynAviation employee’s child under 16 years of age, and received some amazing submissions.” Congratulations to the winner of the contest, Kylie, the four year old granddaughter of DynAviation’s Mike Bryant who works on the NASA Aircraft Maintenance and Operations Support (AMOS) contract. She drew an airplane with hand imprints for wings, accompanied by the slogan, “Safety is in your hands.” “When viewing Kylie’s submission, knowing a four year old girl’s hands represent a safe passage – symbolizing the wings of an aircraft – definitely elicits an emotional response from me, and I hope it does for everyone,” said Neville. “Your safety and your coworker’s safety is truly in your hands. You and your teammates have to build the foundation and the culture that reflects your attitude, belief, and perception of safety.” DynAviation safety coins have been created from Kylie’s design. As a reward for her winning submission, Kylie was presented with an iPad, a plaque and a DynAviation safety coin. “I want to also thank the rest of the children who took the time to create and submit their wonderful pictures,” continued Neville. “We had a tie for second place between Bianca and Emma from Fort Hood, who will receive a gift certificate, plaque and safety coin.”",Public
" This past December, the last wave of DynCorp International (DI) employees departed Camp Gibson in Kabul, Afghanistan and the camp was officially turned over to the Afghan Ministry of Interior (MOI). DI inhabited Camp Gibson for more than eight years, providing security, meals, and operations and maintenance (O&M) support for countless DI and non-DI residents. DI began building Camp Gibson in 2006 and officially moved in August 1, 2007 under the Afghan Police Program (APP) within the U.S. Civilian Police (CIVPOL) contract. At this time Camp Gibson was instead known as the “500 Man Camp.” The camp was later named Camp Gibson in memory of the late Gerald Gibson, a DI employee killed in action in 2004 in Afghanistan. In 2008, Camp Gibson was transferred from APP to the Afghanistan Civilian Advisor Support (ACAS) program. The facility served as a central hub to over 2000 DI police advisors and support personnel stationed at the various regional training centers supporting the work of the U.S. Department of State’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Bureau (INL). In 2011, the ACAS police training advisors were transferred to the U.S. Department of Defense’s Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police (ANA/ANP) programs under the Afghanistan Ministries of Interior (MOI) and Defense (MOD). The goal of this mission was to assist the Afghanistan MOI and MOD in training their forces to assume full responsibility for their own professional police and national army presence. Despite this transfer, DI still maintained Camp Gibson through the end of 2014, providing security and life and mission support services to INL. In 2015, the contract was transitioned again to Gibson Training Center Afghanistan (GTC-A) Security Bridge contract and Life and Mission Support (LMS) contract under INL, both of which were retained by DI. DI’s legacy of support to the State Department at Camp Gibson came to an end on Tuesday, December 15, 2015. DI created and maintained this camp over the years and it was known as one of the top installations in Afghanistan.

" On April 25, 2015, the country of Nepal suffered a magnitude 7.8 earthquake that killed more than 9,000 people and injured more than 23,000. It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since 1934; hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless and entire villages were flattened. The devastation and urgent need for basic necessities prompted the DynCorp International team in Kandahar, Afghanistan, to form a group to help with relief efforts. The DI team partnered with other local organizations that collected monetary donations and supplies such as clothing, bedding and personal hygiene products. “The goal was to provide a network of physical and emotional support during this time of crisis in Nepal,” said Lori Navarro, DynCorp International community care counselor. “The kindness and support was felt from citizens of every nation working here in Afghanistan.” While more than $5,000 was sent to the Red Cross earmarked to Nepal Relief, the logistical delivery of collected donations to Nepal was a challenge. When they could not personally deliver the items to that country, their efforts turned into a new mission, to “pay it forward” to Afghan citizens instead. “The people of Afghanistan are poor like Nepal and we want them to have these goods,” said Karan Bahadur Bam, a Nepalese DI team member who led the project. With help from the Australian Military, two truckloads and 15 triwalls of necessities were transported to Camp Baker for distribution to schools, families and local agencies in Afghanistan",Public

I have been given hope and strength after the tragedy of her loss and am able to better tell our daughter about how her mother was a hero through this experience,” Irungu continued. He added, “The support we have received from DynCorp International has been extraordinary and we hope to maintain a long-term relationship with DI as we continue to remember Lilian.” On July 22, 2014, a suicide bomber on a motorcycle attacked Camp Gibson in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the DI team members served on the Afghanistan Civilian Advisory Support (ACAS) program.

Heidi Shyu, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, commented, “Being in Tier I is an incredible accomplishment.” SSIP rankings are based on performance data from fiscal years 2012 to 2014 gathered through the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). “We remain committed to providing the best equipment to our Soldiers at the best value for the taxpayer,” added Shyu. “SSIP is one of the ways we recognize our top performers.” “This is an effort to look across the Army’s very valuable suppliers and identify those who provide the greatest value in terms of their performance,” said Harry Hallock, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for procurement. “Those suppliers achieving Tier I status are the vendors who consistently achieved or surpassed all contractual requirements, delivering the best products and services to our warfighters.” SSIP was developed to give incentive to those who provide superior military services based on contract obligations and doing business with each of the three services. The program recognizes organizations’ business segments into one of three performance tiers, with “Tier I” being the best. “We’re doing this so people get some feedback from us about how their performance is, relative to their peers,” said Frank Kendall, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. “Then, they can take whatever action they think they need to do to improve their ratings.” Kendall hopes the program will result in increased efficiency and improved performance. “It’s recognition for business units that have been doing a superb job,” Shyu added. “Being in Tier I is ‘a big deal.’”",Public
" More than 100 DynCorp International team members in Kuwait recently completed first aid training, including CPR training. Training was provided by Remote Medical International (RMI) and included topics from simple wound care, tourniquet application, to signs of a stroke and treatment for choking. While this training is mandatory for some DI team members, RMI offered the three-hour course for all at the worksite. DI employees assisted RMI instructors by roleplaying while the RMI medic showed students how to properly dress wounds. Every student participated in the CPR training through role play during possible mock emergency situations, for example, where somebody stopped breathing. Students practiced calling for help, chest compressions and how to use an Automated External Defibrillator (AED). “Everyone who participated in this critical training walked away with a better understanding of what to do in emergency situations and appreciated the hands-on experience RMI provided,” said Ken Pitcher, DynCorp International project manager. “Having an opportunity to sharpen their first aid skills by practicing old and new methods of saving lives, including their own, is always a good investment of time and reinforces one of DI’s important values – We Care.”",Public

"  DynCorp International has partnered with the U.S. Army Reserve in their Cyber Private Public Partnership Program. The program aims to address the need for experts in the cyber domain by enhancing soldiers’ development and retention in this field. “The demand for these cyber security professionals and cyber experienced Soldiers far outpaces the current inventory,” said Lt. Gen. Jeffery Talley, Chief of United States Army Reserve. As part of this partnership, DI will help encourage the exploration of cyber initiatives by providing Army personnel and veterans with applicable employment opportunities. The program will also support soldiers by enhancing their skills, education and training to develop mission-ready professionals who can match their military and civilian career with continuous education opportunities at top tier regional schools. DI is working closely with Drexel University to identify mutually beneficial opportunities. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) identified cybersecurity as one of six federal workforce occupations facing mission-critical skills gaps, business and industry face similar shortages. According to a recent GAO report, an estimated 40,000 cyber security professionals are needed just to satisfy the government’s demand. DynCorp International’s support of U.S. military personnel has earned the Company, as well as several of its team members recognition such as Service Member Patriot Awards. DI also recognizes the experience and dedication that veterans contribute to our business as team members and business partners. Victory Media has selected DI as one of the nation’s Top 100 Military-Friendly Employers® for eight years in a row and DI also earned a spot on Military Times’ 2014 list of “Best for Vets” employers.

" DynCorp International pilot, Geoffrey “Craig” Hunt, was honored by hundreds at a memorial service held Tuesday, October 21, 2014. Hunt was tragically killed on October 7, 2014, while flying an S-2T air tanker deployed to suppress and control a wildfire at Yosemite National Park. He supported DI’s program with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as CAL FIRE. Fellow CAL FIRE pilots, firefighters, and other first responders joined Hunt’s family as well as DI and CAL FIRE representatives to honor his life and show their respects. James Myles, DynCorp International senior vice president, DynAviation, spoke of the bravery of first responders and the specialized skills required of CAL FIRE pilots. “I know why Craig Hunt volunteered to come and fly with CAL FIRE. He wanted to make a difference,” said Myles. “He fought fires and flew the way he lived his life – to the fullest, thinking of others before himself, with no regrets.” Hunt, of San Jose, Calif., was a U.S. military veteran with a proud history of service to others. He served as a U.S. Navy P3 pilot from 1975-1984 and served in the Reserves for 20 years. He supported DI’s CAL FIRE program for more than 12 years. “Craig, who we called ‘The Professor,’ was a valued member of the DI team and he will be greatly missed,” said Jeffrey Cavarra, DynCorp International program director. Hunt earned a Master’s degree in Business from the University of Southern California and a Masters in Biochemistry from the University of Santa Cruz, and served as a chemistry teacher in the off season at the University of Santa Cruz. He had a love for flying, golfing, fishing, hiking, bird watching, scuba diving, math/sciences, teaching, and dogs. He is survived by his wife, Sally Keenan Hunt; two daughters, Sarah Hunt Lauterbach and Nancy Hunt; two brothers, one sister and his father. DynCorp International has worked with CAL FIRE since 2001 helping suppress and control wild land fires in California. As part of the program, DI flies and maintains Grumman S-2T fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft, and fully maintains and services civilian UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots. Operating from across California, aircraft can reach most fires within 20 minutes. The OV-10A aircraft fly over fires, directing the air tankers and helicopters to critical areas for retardant and water drops. The retardant used to slow or retard the spread of a fire is a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum-thickening agent, and a coloring agent. All CAL FIRE Aircraft are strategically located throughout the state at airbases and helicopter bases. During high fire activity, CAL FIRE may move aircraft to better provide statewide air support. The department’s firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft respond to an average of more than 5,600 wild land fires each year. Those fires burn more than 172,000 acres annually.",Public

" DynCorp International employees donated clothes, shoes, blankets and other serviceable items to the local community in Afghanistan through an effort called “Operation Donation.” Working in partnership with International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) teams from Bulgaria and Australia, seven large boxes of donations were collected and distributed in the humanitarian assistance effort. “In addition to many years of conflict, Afghan citizens have been affected by natural disasters including flooding and earthquakes,” said Clara Butterfield, DynCorp International project controls specialist and initiator of Operation Donation. “We were compelled to find a way to help and got a great turnout from our team members.” DI team members will continue to collect and donate supplies such as blankets, especially as winter approaches in Afghanistan. Operation Donation was coordinated and executed by DI team members working in support of the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) in Afghanistan. DI team members collected donations at their Billeting office. They were then inventoried and packed for distribution.

" DynCorp International director of Security Operations, Timothy Bartels, was recently honored with a Service Member Patriot award from the Office of the Secretary of Defense Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR). Bartels was nominated by colleague Trenton Dugan, DynCorp International Security administrator. “Tim has been an amazing manager to work for, straight forward in communications and actions. Immediately upon my return in July from one year of military duty, I knew that DI needed to be recognized. This award is designated specifically to a supervisor even though it has been the company as a whole that has supported me,” commented Dugan. “From the moment that I returned from duty, Tim has supported my actions and looked to see how my experiences with the military could benefit the company as a whole.” “Multiple times I have been placed on orders lasting anywhere from a week to a year. Each time DI has always offered to help in any way they can, even providing me with the resources to work for short periods of time remotely. After being with the company for almost three years it’s great to have the support that is often not found by many other employers,” continued Dugan. An employee serving in the National Guard or Reserve, or the spouse of a Guard or Reserve member, may nominate individual supervisors and bosses for support provided directly to the nominating Service member and his or her family. The Patriot Award reflects the efforts made to support citizen warriors through a wide-range of measures including flexible schedules, time off prior to and after deployment, caring for families and granting leaves of absence if needed. Patriot Awards are awarded to individual supervisors, not to an entire staff or organization as a whole. An individual may nominate as many supervisors as they would like, and each will receive a Patriot Award certificate and accompanying lapel pin. To recognize employers who support their Guard and Reserve employees, ESGR grants a series of Department of Defense (DoD) awards: Many of these awards are progressive in nature, with each building upon the previous. For example, an employer must have had at least one supervisor or other representative honored with a Patriot Award and must have signed a Statement of Support to be eligible for consideration for the Above and Beyond Award. Recognizing supportive employers is vital to ESGR’s mission. ESGR’s 54 State Committees actively promote awards as a key element in furthering employer support, while strengthening relationships between service members and employers. DoD awards honor the sacrifices made by so many employers year after year.",Public

" DynCorp International senior contracts administrator, Tracy Foster, was recently featured in Search & Employ Magazine, a publication of RecruitMilitary. Foster, a 24-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, currently supports DI’s War Reserve Materiel (WRM) program at the Yorktown, Va., Program Management Office. In the article, Foster describes her journey from the military to her civilian career. She retired from the Air Force as a Chief Master Sergeant and served as a contracting squadron superintendent, gaining valuable experience for her transition to DI. At DI, Foster assists in proposal pricing model development, cost input, proposal preparation, contract administration functions, field personnel coordination and with contract negotiations. She joined the Company in early 2014 and hopes to soon earn her Project Manager Certification as well as Lean Six Sigma certification. When asked if she could give any advice to those transitioning from the military to a civilian career, Foster commented, “Always put forward your absolute best effort into anything you want to achieve and you will be successful. Continued education is a must – military members should maximize use of tuition assistance, so when leaving the military you have the highest level of education possible. Never underestimate how important your military training is, whether it’s technical, leadership, or quality type training, civilian employers value those skills.” “Everything I learned in the military helps me with my new job,” she said. “I spent 24 years striving to improve my technical knowledge, computer abilities, leadership and teamwork skills. All the training, education and life skills I gained while in the Air Force helped me make a smooth transition to DynCorp International.” “DynCorp International is a great place for veterans to work because the culture is one of professionalism and integrity,” Foster said. “DynCorp International has a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct to help guide behaviors and business practices. These company values remind me of the Air Force’s Core Values and I am glad to be working for a company that places emphasis on these high standards. Additionally, DynCorp International recognizes the proven valuable skills former military members bring to the company.” DI partners with U.S. Military Transition Offices, supports the Service Academy Career Conferences (SACCs) and participates in U.S. Chamber of Commerce “Hiring our Heroes” employment events, as a part of the Company’s commitment to hiring veterans.

" DynCorp International team members all over the world are focusing on continuous improvement, introducing the Lean Six Sigma process to DI’s programs in aviation, logistics, operations and maintenance, and training. Since August 2013, Lean Six Sigma training has been incorporated throughout the company, certifying more than 200 new Lean practitioners and more than 200 Lean Six Sigma Green Belts. To achieve DI’s continuous improvement goals, the Operations team created a standardized curriculum and certification methodology for Lean Six Sigma Training. “We all have a responsibility if we are going to successfully introduce and embrace a culture of continuous improvement,” said John Bennett, Continuous Improvement senior director, DynCorp International. “Integrating Lean training helps equip our team members to succeed and better serve our customers.” Initial success has led to DI’s Continuous Improvement team expanding training to support higher levels of certification, past the Green Belt and into Black Belt and Master Black Belt, with an increase in overall training events both in a classroom setting and through virtual learning. “Green Belt project results have already made a positive impact on metrics throughout the Company,” commented Bennett. The Continuous Improvement Team is also launching a toolkit for program managers and DI’s Centers of Excellence to aid them in managing continuous improvement at different levels within the organization. Toolkit topics include setting goals, building competency, executing and sustaining projects and measuring results. “We want to empower our employees to feel confident about constantly seeking better and more efficient ways of doing things. We want to make sure that we measure our activities from the point of view of our customer and that processes, standard procedures and metrics are in place so that we can hold each other accountable to our customers’ expectations,” said Bennett. Lean Six Sigma is the combination of two powerful concepts of Lean – understanding the value stream and removing waste – and Six Sigma – reducing variation and controlling the process. Lean accelerates Six Sigma, delivering greater results than what would typically be achieved by Lean or Six Sigma individually. Combining these two methods gives improvement teams a comprehensive tool set to increase the speed and effectiveness of any process within an organization, resulting in increased revenue, reduced costs and improved collaboration. Lean Six Sigma professionals exist at every level – master black belts, black belts, green belts, and Lean Practitioners – who conduct projects and implement improvements.",Public

" DynCorp International is ranked 10th in the 2014 Washington Technology Top 100, a list of the largest contractors in the government market according to their IT, systems integration, telecom, professional services and other high-tech revenue. Last year, DI was ranked 11. In 2013, DI restructured into three strategic business groups: DynAviation, DynLogistics and DynGlobal. The DynAviation Group provides full-spectrum aerospace, aviation and air operations solutions worldwide, while the DynLogistics Group provides total support solutions including conventional and contingency logistics; operations and maintenance support; platform modification and upgrades; supply chain management; training, security and full spectrum intelligence mission support services.

The DynAviation team also formed a strategic alliance with Sierra Nevada Corporation’s (SNC) Integrated Mission Systems (IMS) to provide aviation maintenance support, leading to a new subcontract award to provide contractor logistics support in Afghanistan under the Multi Sensor Aerial Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (MAISR) Operations and Sustainment program. In the DynLogistics Group, key contract wins included a Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) contract to provide logistics support for the agency’s equipment in Afghanistan and a new award to support the U.S. Army – Total Package Fielding (TPF) for the family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (MTVs). DI chairman and CEO, Steven Gaffney, credits DI’s stability to the Company’s continued focus on core competencies. “Stay with what works,” Gaffney said in an interview with Washington Technology. “Stick with your core offerings and do it in a different manner for different customers.” He also commented on DI’s intentional culture which includes a tenet on helping “Create the Future,” keeping team members looking ahead in terms of business success. “In fiscal 2013, all the things we thought could happen did happen,” he said. “In years like this, the question becomes, ‘How do you read the tea leaves early enough to get ahead of the competition?’” “We’ve spent the last four years, building a values-based culture at DynCorp International,” Gaffney added. Those values include a focus on the future, not the moment.”",Public
" On the heels of National Cancer Survivors Day, celebrated annually on the first Sunday of June, DynCorp International team members in McLean, Va., supported the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) by hosting a fundraiser bake sale and food truck lunch with partner, Fava Pot food truck. Team members baked a variety of sweets and “sold” them for donations, raising more than $500 in support of AICR’s cancer research, prevention, treatment and survivorship programs. In addition, the DI office hosted the Fava Pot food truck, which donated 15% of their lunch sales, more than $125, to AICR. National Cancer Survivors Day is an annual, treasured celebration of life that is held in hundreds of communities nationwide and around the world. It is a celebration for those who have survived, an inspiration for those recently diagnosed, a gathering of support for families, and an outreach to the community. Participants unite in a symbolic event to show the world that life after a cancer diagnosis can be meaningful, productive, and even inspiring. This day provides an opportunity for all people living with a history of cancer – including America’s nearly 14 million cancer survivors – to connect with each other, celebrate milestones, and recognize those who have supported them along the way. The National Cancer Survivors Day Foundation defines a “survivor” as anyone living with a history of cancer – from the moment of diagnosis through the remainder of life. The American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) is the cancer charity that fosters research on the relationship of nutrition, physical activity and weight management to cancer risk, interprets the scientific literature and educates the public about the results. It has contributed over $100 million for innovative research conducted at universities, hospitals and research centers across the country. AICR has published two landmark reports that interpret the accumulated research in the field, and is committed to a process of continuous review.

Their contributions must never be forgotten and their memories will always live on,” said assistant Secretary of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, William R. Brownfield, in a statement. Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the attendees as well. “… from this day forward, at this very spot, as Bill has described, in a place that is a thoroughfare for the moment of all of the people who work here in this family, with just as much solemnity and with just as much reverence we honor the men and women – contractors and federal employees alike – who gave the full measure of their capacity of their service to country, of their commitment to the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement mission abroad,” said Kerry. “This is much more than a list of names. It’s a legacy of stories, individual stories, each one with a human face that tells the story of a brave person who served their country,” he continued. The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs commissioned a Memorial Wall to honor those who died while serving on behalf of INL.

" DynCorp International chairman and chief executive officer, Steven Gaffney, recently was a featured speaker on a panel discussing the aerospace supply chain at the Global Aerospace Summit, held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Panelists discussed how their respective businesses were positioned for business growth in the current aerospace industry environment. During a question and answer session, Gaffney discussed current aerospace industry trends, including a focus on best value from service providers, the importance of retaining talented personnel and an increased need for knowledge transfer components in global programs. He also discussed the changing role of service contractors in aerospace maintenance and integration and highlighted supply chain involvement and forming partnerships and strategic alliances. The Global Aerospace Summit is an invitation-only event for C-level executives, senior decision makers and government officials involved with the aerospace, aviation, defence and space industries. The summit is comprised of three days of strategic level discussions, closed-door debates, networking and site visits. More than 1,250 industry leaders attended the event which took place April 7-9, 2014, at the St. Regis Hotel, Saadiyat Island, in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The development of the Global Aerospace Summit was driven by a need for a cross-industry thought leadership forum that allowed international peers to engage in strategic and forward looking debate and address the key challenges facing the aerospace, aviation, space and defense industries. Topics included partnerships and competition, the globalization of the supply chain, and workforce development. The theme of the 2014 Summit is the role of the aerospace industries in regional and national economic diversiﬁcation.

" DynCorp International team members in Sarajevo and Afghanistan worked together to provide support to flood victims in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia. Tens of thousands have lost their homes due to the worst flooding to hit the area in recorded history. The catastrophic rains have left a third of Bosnia under water and landslides triggered by the floods also raised the risk of injury or death from land mines left over from Bosnia’s 1992-95 war.

" DynCorp International chairman and chief executive officer, Steven Gaffney, discussed the role of service contractors as part of the Atlantic Council Captains of Industry series. Tying in with the observance of the Memorial Day holiday, Gaffney described the sacrifice that contractors also make while serving missions around the world. “We all are familiar with and stand in awe of those who dedicate their lives to military service, but there is another group of individuals who serve as well,” said Gaffney. “Even though their service and sacrifice have become an accepted part of the mission cadence of U.S. government contracting industry, unfortunately their service and sacrifice is far less celebrated.” DI team members serve all over the world, supporting programs in aviation, logistics, training, intelligence and operational solutions. Gaffney described their roles as pilots helping fight wildfires from the sky, and as aviation maintenance specialists servicing the aircraft that carry the top elected officials of the United States.” “Memorial Day is a bit different for us at DI and many of our colleagues in the contractor community. On Memorial Day I know I’ll be thinking not only about the brave men and women of our military who serve and paid the ultimate price, but also about contractors who lost their lives while serving as well,” said Gaffney. “I thank all of them for their service and sacrifice.” To date, 71 DI team members have lost their lives supporting U.S. government and ally country missions. To honor these colleagues, a memorial wall with each team member’s name has been installed at DI’s new global headquarters building in McLean, Va. The Atlantic Council promotes constructive leadership and engagement in international affairs based on the central role of the Atlantic Community in meeting global challenges. Founded in 1961, the Council provides an essential forum for navigating the dramatic shifts in economic and political influence that are shaping the twenty-first century by educating and galvanizing its uniquely influential, nonpartisan network of international political, business, and intellectual leaders.

" DynCorp International parent, Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc., reported first quarter 2014 financial results. “Despite the slowdown in contract awards that has been recognized across our industry, we saw the team continue to capture new business at an impressive win rate and I am cautiously optimistic about the almost $6 billion in proposals that are currently submitted and awaiting award across the three businesses,” said Steve Gaffney, chairman and CEO. “With the drawdown in the Middle East, our focus remains on growth from our core into new areas through our commercial and internationally-focused business, DynGlobal, and through innovative partnerships created in our DynAviation and DynLogistics Groups.” Bill Kansky, chief financial officer, added, “As the slowing operational tempo of the war pressures our revenues we need to realize lower working capital levels, which will allow us to continue to retire our outstanding debt. As previously communicated, the Company expects to pay down at least $50 million of debt in 2014, and we are on-plan through the first quarter as we made a $15 million prepayment on our term loan.”",Public
" For the third year in a row, DynCorp International (DI) has earned a 2014 Champions of Veteran Enterprise Award from the National Veteran Small Business Coalition (NVSBC). Federal agencies and prime contractors that meet or exceed the three percent goal of providing opportunities to veteran-owned (VOSB) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSB) are being recognized for this honor.

Their vision is to ensure that veteran businesses are given first consideration for federal prime and subcontracting procurement opportunities. VETS brings together federal agencies, prime contractors, and veterans to network and discuss how to take full advantage of the federally mandated contracting opportunities set aside for veteran-owned small businesses. For more than 20 years, various veteran small business groups have achieved success in advocating for veterans to be seen as a viable force in the Federal government acquisition landscape. Beginning with the enactment of Public Law 106-50 in 1998, the nation began to understand the earned benefit of honorable military service and veterans continuing to serve their nation through entrepreneurship and selling goods and services to the federal government. VETS provides a platform for all stakeholders to get closer to these goals and support our veteran small businesses.",Public
" When a fellow DynCorp International team member was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in late 2013, DI team members in McLean, Va., wanted to take action. In search of a way to make a positive impact, they joined together for the 2014 Tidewater PurpleStride 5K, an event that directly benefits the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. DI team members created Team Kathy Riggs, in support of their colleague currently undergoing treatment, and raised nearly $11,000 – the highest amount raised by any team at the event. As the top fundraising team, they were presented with a certificate on stage at the event and will be recognized on the PurpleStride.org Wall of Fame. “We wanted to do something positive to show our support,” said Colleen Timmer, DynCorp International Contracts manager and captain of Team Kathy Riggs. Riggs, a DynCorp International market strategy director, was also in attendance the day of the race as her family joined the team during the 5K. “It was a really inspiring event and we were so happy to be part of it!” commented Timmer. “Having Kathy and her family join us at the event made our contribution that much more meaningful.” DI team members surpassed their goal of raising $5,000 with the team’s individual donations being matched with a corporate donation. The 2014 Tidewater PurpleStride 5K took place April 5 at the Virginia Beach 31st Street Park, in Virginia Beach, Va., hosted by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network’s Tidewater affiliate. The event raised a total of more than $140,000. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is a nationwide network of people dedicated to working together to advance research, support patients and create hope for those affected by pancreatic cancer. Founded in 1999, the non-profit Pancreatic Cancer Action Network’s national office is in Manhattan Beach, Calif., with offices in Washington, D.C., and volunteer leadership in more than 90 communities around the country. An estimated 46,000 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year, though research on this type of cancer has been historically underfunded. Only approximately two percent of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) budget is allocated towards this research, which could help find new cures and improve survival rates. Donations from events like the Tidewater PurpleStride 5K help to change these dismal statistics by funding research grants, advocacy efforts, patient support, and awareness activities coordinated by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.",Public

The DI team, DI Stars, raised nearly $8,000 through this event. DynCorp International Supply Chain director, Billy Harlin, singlehandedly raised $1,645 towards the team total! The DI Stars team also chose to run in memory of their fallen colleagues, wearing shirts with photos of each DI team member who lost their life while serving on a DI program in the last five years. “TAPS has provided such great support to the family members of many of our fellow team members over the years,” commented Elaine Kinnee, DynCorp International Employee Assistance Program (EAP) coordinator. “We were proud to be able to honor our colleagues and raise funds so others could benefit from TAPS’s great programs.” Hundreds of people every year run (or walk) at races throughout the country to remember and honor our fallen service members and raise funds to help TAPS assist the families left behind. TAPS Run & Remember Team events are held throughout the country, where TAPS has an organized team in the race. Depending on the race length and format, teams may include children, surviving families of the fallen, and just ordinary citizens who want to honor the fallen and care for their families. Team members have online fundraising web pages where they can ask friends and others to contribute to support their run, share why they are running, and offer information about who they are running for. The funds raised through Run and Remember events flow directly into TAPS programming which supports families who have been impacted by a death in the military or as a contractor through an amazing network of resources, seminars and publications. TAPS provides these services at no charge to survivors from all branches of the service, including Reserves and National Guard. TAPS’ programs and services are available not only for immediate family, but also for extended family and friends. Also in March 2014, DI and TAPS established a formal agreement – TAPS’s first with a private company – to provide survivors of DI employees comfort and care through comprehensive services and programs including peer-based emotional support, case work assistance, connections to community-based care, and grief and trauma resources.",Public
" Several DynCorp International team members participated in a head-shaving event to raise funds for St. Baldrick’s Foundation, which supports childhood cancer research. The DI team took part in a local event held at The Avenue Viera in Viera, Fla., on March 15, 2014, and raised a total of $2,500. Five DI team members volunteered to have their heads shaved to support nine-year-old Matthew S., of Palm Bay, Fla., who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in November 2010. “We chose to support St. Baldrick’s as childhood cancer has impacted the lives of many of our fellow team members, family and friends,” said Joseph Balser, DynCorp International manager, IT Business Systems & Development. Jorge Camacho, DynCorp International quality control inspector, said, “I haven’t shaved my head since I joined the military 38 years ago. Shaving it to raise funds for childhood cancer research was most comforting, thinking that I could help save a young life.” “The generosity displayed by the DynCorp International Team and the St. Baldrick’s Foundation amazes me,” commented Stephen Shillingsburg, IT systems analyst, DynCorp International. “Having a personal link to childhood cancer brings certain imbedded knowledge with that connection. My sincerest appreciation goes to all whom have participated directly and indirectly in this worthy cause.” St. Baldrick’s head-shaving events began as a challenge between businessmen and have grown from one event in 2000 to more than 1,300 events in 2012, raising critical funds for childhood cancer research. Because children with cancer often lose their hair during treatment, “shavees” for the St. Baldrick’s Foundation show their support by shaving their heads voluntarily, standing proudly bald beside them. The true goal of head-shaving events is to inspire friends and family to donate to the cure for childhood cancer, raising funds for lifesaving childhood cancer research. “Shavees” sign up on the website, collect money from friends and family much like a walk-a-thon, then participate at a volunteer-organized event in their community to take their turn in the barber’s chair. More than $25 million has already been raised through these events in 2014. The St. Baldrick’s Foundation is a volunteer-driven charity dedicated to raising money for life-saving childhood cancer research and funds more in childhood cancer grants than any organization except for the U.S. government. Since the Foundation’s first grants as an independent charity in 2005, St. Baldrick’s has funded more than $127 million to support the most brilliant childhood cancer research experts in the world.",Public
" DynCorp International was a proud sponsor of the 2014 Taste of the South held March 29, 2014, at the Washington Hilton in Washington, DC. DI sponsored the state of Texas, directly benefitting the Comfort Crew for Military Kids. The Comfort Crew is a non-profit organization that supports military children through programs that combine customized in-person live experiences, animated DVD’s, guided journals, and an online web-portal to help them through the unique situations they experience as a military child. Each Comfort Crew piece uses a unique blend of humor and personal stories to open kids up to talking about serious subjects in a way that is accessible to children. Comfort Crew has assisted more than 100,000 children in just the past two years. The Taste of the South (TOTS) was founded in 1982 by southerners who had relocated to Washington, D.C., from Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.  Wanting to share their traditions with new friends as well as each other, the group held their first party for $15 a ticket and then donated the proceeds to a southern-based charity. Donations grew year after year, and even during tough economic times the group was able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to give away. In 2003, TOTS created the “Dixie Fund” to earmark funds from the annual event toward the charity of choice of one of its member states. This year’s featured charity is West End School in Louisville, Kentucky. West End School provides a free, private college-prep education for at-risk young men in the community from pre-K to 8th grade. West End School, which opened its doors in 2005, provides an alternative form of education for such at-risk students. West End School, which is run primarily by volunteers, creates a culture of high expectations for its students, which has led to the success of the School as well as its graduates.",Public

" Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc., the parent of DynCorp International Inc., a global services provider, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2013 financial results. DI’s fourth quarter revenue was $711.8 million, compared with fourth quarter 2012 revenue of $1,025.8 million, with the decrease primarily driven by reduced needs in Iraq and Afghanistan. For the full year 2013, the Company reported revenue of $3.3 billion, compared with $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced service needs in Iraq, affecting both the Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Air Wing (“INL Air Wing”) and Worldwide Protective Services (“WPS”) contracts; the accelerated pace of the drawdown in Afghanistan, which impacted the demand for services under the Company’s Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (“LOGCAP IV”) contract and caused reduced training needs under the Afghanistan Ministry of Defense Program (“AMDP”) contract; fewer new contract wins and the delay in business awards caused by the U.S. budget uncertainty and sequestration. Net loss attributable to Holdings was $253.7 million for 2013, an increase of $244.8 million from the net loss attributable to Holdings reported in 2012, with the decline driven primarily by the factors discussed above and the impact of a charge related to a contract dispute that occurred in the third quarter of 2013. “Despite prolonged delays in new business awards, sequestration and the first U.S. government shutdown in 17 years, the team was still able to hold our win rates constant, identify and deliver cost efficiencies, and continue to delight our customers,” said Steve Gaffney, DynCorp International chairman and chief executive officer. “We expected to feel the impact of op-tempo changes in Afghanistan – and we did – but held our focus on quality service, and continuing to develop the new commercial leg of our business.” Full year 2013 highlights include:  ",Public

January is a challenging time for blood donation because winter weather and busy post-holiday schedules can make it difficult for blood donors to keep appointments. Regardless of the time of year, hospital patients nationwide need about 44,000 blood donations daily for cancer care, surgeries, and the treatment of serious diseases and trauma. Just one pint of blood can help save up to three lives. Blood donation organizations encourage donors to make and keep appointments during National Blood Donor month and hold events such as winter blood drives to support donation efforts.",Public

" The Washington Post recently featured DynCorp International’s support of the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), which provides assistance to families that have lost a loved one working overseas. TAPS not only supports families of fallen military personnel, but also contractors, and has personally worked with families of former DI team members. “More than 65 percent of our personnel are veterans so supporting the U.S. military has always been a priority at DynCorp International, but working with TAPS is particularly special to us because they have also helped civilian families and, specifically families of DI personnel who have lost their lives while on mission,” Steve Gaffney, chairman and chief executive officer, DynCorp International, previously commented. As part of an ongoing campaign, DI began its “Red Shirt Friday” program in 2011 in which team members all over the world are encouraged to wear red shirts purchased from the DI company store at the end of each week to show their support of U.S. troops. For each shirt sold, the Company donates $10 to TAPS, directly benefitting their valuable programs for survivors. To date, DI has donated more than $50,000 to TAPS through the Red Shirt Friday program alone. DI has supported TAPS through its annual Honor Guard Galas and this year participating in the first ever TysonsRegional™ Chamber 5K Corporate Challenge, raising $10,000 through the event. DI chairman and CEO, Steve Gaffney, also serves as co-chair on the TAPS Leadership Committee. “Sixty-five percent of [our] workforce [are] veterans and the others — even though they didn’t serve — many believe they serve that mission though the civilian workforce,” Gaffney said. TAPS provides ongoing emotional help, hope, and healing to all who are grieving the death of a loved one in military service to America, regardless of relationship to the deceased, geography, or circumstance of the death. TAPS meets its mission by providing peer-based support, crisis care, casualty casework assistance, and grief and trauma resources.

The CCISO award is an executive certification that honors an individual for their contributions within the information security community while demonstrating tremendous professional growth and innovative security practices. Horn was one of only three finalists for the CCISO award this year, as announced at EC-Council’s 4th Global CISO Forum held September 19-20, 2013, in Atlanta, Ga. EC-Council’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) program recognizes an individual’s skills in developing and executing an information security management strategy in alignment with organizational goals.

This skill set enables the CISO to be the best guardian of their organization’s digital assets. The role of a CISO is to address emerging threats to information security by developing and maintaining an information security strategy utilizing leadership and communication skills and innovative solutions. EC-Council cites strong technical knowledge, experience and business communication expertise as key traits of an effective CISO. Those who earn a CISO Certification are able to most effectively plan and oversee information security for any organization. Horn began his career at DI as the cyber security manager for the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program. In that role, Horn advocated a strong understanding of information security to executive leadership and produced quantitative metrics to grow the department by discovering exceptional talent from across a wide range of information security specialties such as industrial security, cryptography, regulatory, compliance, and firewalls engineers. Horn empowered many of his teammates to take on new roles and gain valuable experience, making them firewall engineers, incident response members, endpoint security professionals and vulnerability engineers. Horn and his team also developed a comprehensive cyber security program responsible for information categorization, risk and vulnerability analysis, remediation, compliance, investigations, and Operational Security (OPSEC).

" Several DynCorp International team members in Texas volunteered their Saturday afternoons to work with Habitat for Humanity, helping renovate a local elderly woman’s home. DI team members worked on the exterior of the home, removing old paint and repainting it as part of the Preserve a Home program. “We had a great time working together to make these updates on the home with other local volunteers and were touched by how gracious the home’s owner was after presenting her with a freshly painted exterior,” said Ashley Schultze, DynCorp International senior benefits specialist. Habitat for Humanity’s Preserve a Home program aims to assist homeowners in urban neighborhoods that struggle to maintain and care for the exterior of their homes. Some of these homes have fallen into disrepair, often into code citations, loss of homeowner insurance, loss of equity, and ultimately could face mortgage foreclosure. Qualifying homeowners earning 60% of area median income or less work alongside sponsor and community volunteers and a construction staff to rehabilitate their homes, if they are physically able to do so. Preserve a Home projects include exterior rehabilitations, weatherizations, and Cowtown Brush-Up projects in partnership with the City of Fort Worth. DI team members partnered with the Trinity branch of Habitat for Humanity in this volunteer project. Habitat for Humanity’s vision is that “everyone has access to a quality, affordable home.” Trinity Habitat for Humanity builds and rehabs homes in Johnson, Parker, Tarrant and Wise Counties in Texas. Habitat for Humanity International was founded in 1976 by Millard and Linda Fuller and has built more than 500,000 quality, affordable homes serving more than 2.5 million people worldwide. Habitat for Humanity volunteers, working hand-in-hand with the families they serve, build quality, affordable homes using donations of money and materials. Partner families invest hundreds of hours of sweat equity in the construction of their homes. Once completed, they buy their homes, making monthly payments on an interest-free mortgage. Their house payments revolve back into Habitat’s work; a dollar invested in Habitat is a buck that never stops — it just keeps building. With more than 1,500 U.S. affiliates and 550 international affiliates coordinating Habitat house-building projects in over 3,000 communities around the world, Habitat has attracted millions of volunteers, from U.S. presidents to celebrities. Fort Worth Area Habitat for Humanity, Inc. was founded in 1989 as an affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International, serving Fort Worth and Tarrant County. In 2006, the name was changed to Trinity Habitat for Humanity to include the four counties they now serve. Having grown from a handful of dedicated founders into a volunteer corps of thousands, today Trinity Habitat for Humanity is ranked #20 out of 1,571 Habitat affiliates in the nation in new home production.",Public

Second quarter revenue decreased $84.6 million, or 8.8%, to $876.5 million compared to second quarter 2012, primarily driven by lower content under the Company’s Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) IV contract and reduced demand for training needs as the war in Afghanistan winds down. This was partially offset by a $67.2 million increase in revenue from the Aviation Group based on the improved performance of the Contract Field Team (CFT), NASA Aircraft Maintenance Operational Support program and T-6 Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (T6-COMBS) contracts. Net income attributable for the second quarter 2013 was $8.3 million, representing a decrease of $0.7 million compared to second quarter 2012. Net income attributable was primarily impacted by reduced demand for services related to the declining operational tempo in the war in Afghanistan. This was partially offset by continued growth of the DynAviation business, lower interest expense during the quarter as a result of the $90 million reduction in long-term debt during 2012 and lower selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $48.6 million for the second quarter, representing 5.5% of revenue, and a 6.2% decrease from the same period in 2012. “No matter how tough the operational tempo, this quarter showed that our 30,000 employees and team mates around the world are dedicated to coming together, pulling in the same direction, delivering outstanding services to our customers all while improving operating margins,” said Steve Gaffney, chairman and CEO. “During the quarter, we implemented organizational changes that are already improving our operational efficiency and reducing costs.”",Public

" DynCorp International team members from Pensacola, Fla., participated in a Veterans Airlift Command flight to help transport a wounded warrior from his home in Crestview, Fla., to a rehabilitation center in Key West, Fla. DI provided the aircraft, flying time, pilot, crew and fuel to support the flight. The DI team volunteered their free time to fly the wounded warrior and his family on the two hour trip, free of charge to their family.

" DynCorp International recently donated $2,500 to the Care and Share Food Bank of Southern Colorado to support the firefighters and those affected by the Black Forest and Canon City wildfires. “This cause is near and dear to us as our own team members have helped fight wild land fires,” said Jeffrey Cavarra, DynCorp International program manager, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, (CAL FIRE). “We know firsthand how hard those firefighters are working and we are happy to help in any way we can.” Thousands of Colorado citizens have been forced to evacuate their homes as the fires continue to spread. Dozens of homes have been destroyed leaving many displaced and in need of food, shelter and other essential items. For more information on donating to the Care and Share Food Bank of Southern Colorado, visit http://careandshare.org/. Care and Share was established more than 35 years ago by Franciscan Sister Dominique Pisciotta as a referral agency to coordinate food distribution in the Southern Colorado area. The organization continued to evolve and grew from a simple clearinghouse for food distribution to a complex telephone referral service and food bank administrator. Care and Share is now a member of the Feeding America network and focuses mainly on food distribution. In addition to providing food resources, Feeding America serves as a resource for professional development and networking opportunities, as well as coordinating efforts for product donations and distribution in disaster situations. DynCorp International has worked with CAL FIRE since 2001 helping suppress and control wild land fires in California. As part of the program, DI flies and maintains Grumman S-2T fire retardant air tankers and OV-10A aircraft, and fully maintains and services civilian UH-1H Super Huey helicopters flown by CAL FIRE pilots. Operating from across California, aircraft can reach most fires within 20 minutes. The OV-10A aircraft fly over fires, directing the air tankers and helicopters to critical areas for retardant and water drops. The retardant used to slow or retard the spread of a fire is a slurry mix consisting of a chemical salt compound, water, clay or a gum-thickening agent, and a coloring agent. While both airtankers and helicopters are equipped to carry fire retardant or water, the helicopters can also transport firefighters, equipment and injured personnel. All CAL FIRE Aircraft are strategically located throughout the state at airbases and helicopter bases. During high fire activity, CAL FIRE may move aircraft to better provide statewide air support. The department’s firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft respond to an average of more than 5,600 wildland fires each year. Those fires burn more than 172,000 acres annually.",Public
" When the Afghan-American Women’s Association (A-AWA) needed help shipping supplies to those in need in Afghanistan, DynCorp International answered the call.

The A-AWA is a non-profit organization that each year collects clothing and monetary donations to send to needy areas of Afghanistan where local citizens, many of which are school-aged children, are in need of warm clothing for the winter season. “For the past 4 years this program has grown larger each year with increasing positive impact for those in need.  Logistically, it has become very difficult for our organization to get these donations shipped to where they can be of use,” said Shahla Ahmadi, president and founder of the Afghan-American Women’s Association. “DI’s sponsorship and assistance is truly appreciated. It is an honor to be affiliated with a company that understands the importance of putting human need in focus.” A-AWA was founded as a result of the growing Afghan-American presence in the U.S., especially in the greater Washington, D.C. metropolitan region. A-AWA’s mission is to serve as a platform for organizing Afghan-American women through cultural, educational, charitable, and social activities. The needs of the Afghan-American community are many, as are the potential resources to address those needs. A-AWA serves as the connection between the needs of the community and available resources. A-AWA’s primary goal is to obtain funding and construct a community center to serve the various needs of the community. In addition, they will continue to serve the local community by providing opportunities for educational, cultural, and professional growth. The association’s position as a community organizer provides guidance to those most in need with appropriate services. A-AWA’s community outreach programs include assistance for newly-arrived immigrants, support for critically ill Afghans and their families, language and citizenship classes, educational presentations for the community, a venue for youth volunteerism, and clothing, food and medicine drives for the needy in Afghanistan.",Public

" DynCorp International parent, Delta Tucker Holdings, Inc., recently reported first quarter 2013 financial results. Highlights include revenue of $932.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $53.3 million. “Despite U.S. government budget issues and the shifting focus in Afghanistan, our team delivered increased earnings and strong EBITDA margins while managing a reduction in the top line,” said Steve Gaffney, chairman and CEO. “Looking ahead, as organizational changes that were made in the beginning of the second quarter mature, I expect to see even more opportunity arise. Our new structure will help us achieve efficiencies in our existing businesses while introducing a new business Group that will fuel international commercial growth. This refined organization will help us become more effective and successful in delivering our services globally.” First quarter revenue decreased $115.0 million or 11% to $932.1 million compared to first quarter 2012, primarily driven by lower content under the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program IV contract as the war in Afghanistan winds down. This was partially offset by a $61.3 million increase in revenue from the Aviation Group based on the continued strength of new contract wins from 2012. Net income attributable for the first quarter 2013 was $15.0 million, representing a $9.4 million improvement compared to first quarter 2012. Net income attributable to Holdings benefited from improved operating profitability, reduced interest expense based on the $90 million reduction in long-term debt during 2012.

" “Among other missions,” writes DI NASA program manager Jim Snowden, “our team flies to Russia to pick up U.S. astronauts returning via the Russian Soyuz capsule from the International Space Station.” DI team members participated in NASA astronaut Kevin Ford’s return to the United States after 142 days aboard the International Space Station. Ford returned to Earth via a Russian Soyuz space capsule and landed in Kazakhstan March 16. The next day he was flown back to the United States in a specially equipped NASA Gulfstream III, maintained and crewed by NASA and DynCorp International team members. The mission was commanded by NASA Aircraft Operations branch chief pilot Bill Ehrenstrom and piloted by DI’s Tom Ryan. Prior to the mission, DI mechanics James Molina, Scott Leonard, Johnny Scott, Mike Brown and Keith Halkard worked diligently to de-configure the aircraft from a recent research mission and then configure the aircraft for this “Direct Return” mission. The work entailed removing racks of research equipment, interior furnishings and other support equipment. Then the team installed beds, chairs and medical equipment to support the astronaut’s trip back to the U.S. In addition to preparing the interior, the mechanics completed scheduled maintenance to ensure top performance for this important mission. Mechanic Johnny Scott accompanied the aircraft to provide servicing and maintenance as needed. Support provided by all of the DI mechanics ensured the mission was successful and the aircraft was able to provide safe, reliable and comfortable transportation for the aircrew and passengers. The next astronaut Direct Return mission is planned for mid-May. In the meantime, the aircraft will be reconfigured to resume research missions across North and Central America. DI has provided aircraft maintenance and support for NASA – the National Aeronautics and Space Administration – since June 2012. Services include support for flight operations; maintenance, repairs and alterations to aircraft, component parts and support equipment; and engineering services.

" DynCorp International Contract Field Team (CFT) members at Camp Bondsteel, Kosovo, support the U.S. Army’s Theater Sustainment Manager assigned to the aviation taskforce supporting NATO Kosovo Force (KFOR). The team provides all levels of aircraft maintenance support, including limited depot repairs, in support of KFOR’s aviation taskforce. Services that are routinely provided include scheduled preventive maintenance checks and services, airframe structural repairs, troubleshooting and repair of aircraft systems, and back shop component repairs. DI has provided continuous aircraft maintenance support to KFOR since May 2001.

The PMI inspection is a comprehensive and thorough inspection of the complete aircraft, ensuring that there are no safety-of-flight conditions. “Each aircraft’s deferred workload is different, and there is no way to know beforehand what safety-of-flight conditions may exist. However the DI team at Camp Bondsteel excels at being able to anticipate challenges and being flexible enough to meet the requirements of a changing scenario,” said John Purdy, DynCorp International site supervisor.

DI personnel joined other USO volunteers at Fort Belvoir to fill each box with the essentials for a Thanksgiving meal. –From cake and bread mixes, to canned fruits and vegetables, the boxes contained everything a family could want, including a gift card to purchase a turkey from their local grocery store. USO Metro organizes the annual event as another way to say thank you to military families. Salaries for junior enlisted soldiers are modest and for many families a Thanksgiving feast can be a big expense. “Turkeys for Troops” is open to active duty service members at the E5 rank and below who sign up for the program and are approved in advance. Volunteers pack the boxes, deliver them to military posts in the area and distribute them to enlisted service members. The box stuffing event, which took place Saturday, November 17, 2012, wasn’t only a good deed, it was a great workout! Volunteers rolled up their sleeves to pack hundreds of boxes with non-perishable Thanksgiving fixings including corn, peas, green beans and yams; cake mix, icing, and pie crust; cornbread, cranberry sauce, and gravy. Kenneth Juergens, Global Logistics and Development Solutions group vice president, Joe Kale, chief compliance officer and Ashley Burke, vice president of communications joined scores of DI volunteers who were accompanied by family and friends, packing box after box. In just three hours more than 800 boxes were ready for delivery to grateful families in perfect time for the upcoming holiday on Thursday. “The DI team made a difference for hundreds of families in just a few hours,” Burke said. “The USO does such a great job organizing events that allow us to thank those who serve; we’re proud to be among their top sponsors.”",Public

" DynCorp International team members located at the Falls Church, Va. headquarters and Alexandria, Va. offices donated nearly 500 pounds of food towards this year’s Food for Others Thanksgiving Food Drive. Food for Others collects items necessary for a complete Thanksgiving meal and puts together baskets that will provide a full holiday meal for families in the Northern Virginia area. DynCorp International team members donated canned potatoes, canned fruit, gravy, stuffing mix and other non-perishable items to complete Thanksgiving meal baskets. Last year, DI donated more than 400 lbs. of food to Food for Others. Established in 1995, Food for Others serves families in the Northern Virginia area that may need food donations when an emergency strikes, and for the growing number of working poor who are unable to make ends meet and need to supplement their inadequate food supplies. Food for Others obtains much of its food through food rescue operations and food drives. Through food rescue operations, staff and volunteers pick up non-expired food items that would be otherwise thrown away from local grocery stores and other retail food establishments. The food is brought to the warehouse for temporary storage, including refrigeration as appropriate. Food drives contribute to most of the non-perishable food supply. Food for Others’ mission is to obtain and distribute free food to those in need in the Northern Virginia area and to support food programs of other community-based organizations. Food for Others also provides a channel for people to volunteer their services and help their neighbors in need. Local merchants, the USDA, food drives, and crop harvests provide the food; volunteers and staff provide the hands; and charitable contributions and fundraising events provide the funds. Charitable contributions provide a major part of Food for Others’ budget. About 96 cents out of every revenue dollar is used for program expenses. The DynCorp International values that we apply to our job performance – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform, We Do the Right Thing – are also values that we carry into the communities where we live and work, especially around the holidays. It is a priority to DI team members in Falls Church, Va. and Alexandria, Va. to support our neighbors in the Northern Virginia area by participating in activities like local food drives.

Valda shares his personal story of how his work at DI has helped fulfill his own American dream. Diversity Journal included columns from several leaders at world-renowned companies who share how their personal and corporate stories related to the American dream. In his own column Valda, a native of Bolivia, describes his work with projects funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). “While engaged in such work in Bolivia, one of the most challenging projects that I worked on involved anticorruption. It was incredibly difficult, but a calling that I found important to pursue,” said Valda. When he continued to pursue work in the international development field, Valda interviewed with Casals & Associates, a DynCorp International business. “During my first interview I met with an American woman to discuss potential opportunities. As I left the interview, I was concerned that my English was not strong enough to secure a position,” Valda commented. However, after three interviews, he was offered a position to support an anticorruption project. “I was thrilled to be able to use the expertise from my previous position to assist on a program where everyone was exhibiting honesty and hard work,” he said. After working with Casals & Associates for two years in his home country, Valda was given the opportunity to work at DynCorp International headquarters in Falls Church, Va. He moved his family to the U.S. and is in the process of obtaining permanent residency and eventually become an American citizen. “I have to confess that living in the U.S. was always a secret dream of mine and I feel so fortunate to now be living and working in this great country – it is my American Dream,” said Valda.

Burke has worked in communications for more than 15 years, previously serving as an executive vice president at Prism Public Affairs and communications director at the Entertainment Software Association. “With just four percent of the companies on this year’s Fortune 500 list led by female CEOs, the paucity of women in corporate leadership positions is evidence that the advancement of women in the workplace is an issue of great debate,” said Burke in her profile. On the issue of encouraging future women leaders, Burke commented, “It is incumbent upon all of us to work within our families and communities to ensure that future generations of women see themselves as natural leaders and inherently believe that professional ambition isn’t gender specific.” Profiles in Diversity Journal also highlights Hispanic Heritage Month, examining the current challenges facing the Hispanic and Latino community. Education, jobs, language barriers, issues of assimilation and overcoming stereotypes are all factors that are faced as the Hispanic community continues to grow. Hannah Breshin-Otero, who is highlighted as a noteworthy leader in the Hispanic Heritage feature, is senior counsel for labor and employment at DI and manages labor and employment matters for DI team members worldwide. Prior to joining DI, she was an attorney with the international law firms of Jones Day and Paul Hastings in Washington, D.C., and she also clerked for The Honorable Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Court, District of Puerto Rico. Breshin-Otero currently serves on the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) Legal Education Fund’s Board of Directors. “My long-time and active involvement with the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) has been invaluable,” commented Breshin-Otero. “It’s a great organization serving an important mission with an impressive network of professionals.” When asked what kind of advice she would give to the next generation of Hispanic/Latino business leaders, she said, “Work hard and remain true to yourself. Remember to give back to your community and mentor those behind you.” Profiles in Diversity Journal, now in its 14th year, is a bi-monthly magazine focusing on diversity/inclusion in business, government, non-profit, higher education and military settings.

" In the first year of its “Red Shirt Friday” program, DynCorp International donated $31,330 to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS). Around the world, people are showing their support for the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces by participating in “Red Shirt Fridays,” where individuals wear a red shirt to show their support for U.S. servicemen and women. In 2011, DynCorp International joined the trend and saw it as an opportunity to do good at the same time. The Company created red polo shirts, embroidered with the words: “Support the troops – Red Shirt Fridays.” For each shirt sold, DynCorp International donates $10 to the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), a non-profit that cares for the families of the fallen. TAPS provides support to military and contractor families who have lost a loved one, and it is particularly special to DI because it has helped the families of DI personnel who have lost their lives while on mission. Over the past year, DI team members all over the world participated in the program, wearing red polo shirts each Friday, purchased from the DI Company store, in a show of support for servicemen and women. For each shirt sold, DI donated $10 to TAPS, selling more than 3,000 total shirts in the past year. All shirts are embroidered with the words: “Support the troops – Red Shirt Fridays.” The Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) provides ongoing assistance to those who are grieving the death of a loved one in U.S. military service. Regardless of relationship to the deceased, geography, or circumstance of the death, TAPS aims meet its mission by providing peer-based support, crisis care, casualty casework assistance, and grief and trauma resources. Established in 1994, TAPS is now a front-line resource to families and loved ones of military men and women and has assisted more than 30,000 surviving family members, casualty officers and caregivers. Earlier this year, DI also supported TAPS as a sponsor of their 2012 Honor Guard Gala which directly benefits TAPS’ grief support programs for survivors.  DI chairman and CEO, Steve Gaffney, also serves as co-chair on the TAPS Leadership Committee. Supporting TAPS is particularly special to DI because it has helped the families of DI team members who have lost their lives while on mission.

" DynCorp International sponsored one current and two former DI team members in the 32nd Annual Tin Man Triathlon held July 29 in Honolulu, Hawaii. The triathlon consisted of a 750 meter swim, 40 kilometer bike ride and a 10 kilometer run. Clint Barkley, senior operations coordinator for the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) at DynCorp International, Steve Martin, former DI civilian police advisor and Joel “Andy” Herbst, who previously worked with DI in support of the Department of State’s Civilian Police (CIVPOL) training Program, made up the “DynCorp International Patriots” team. What made this event so significant for the DI Patriots was that Barkley, Martin and Herbst all sustained injuries from serving in Afghanistan or Iraq, and completed their portions of the triathlon with the help of prosthetics. Michael Warren, vice president, Human Resources Employee Assistance Programs, was on-site and encouraged the DI team at transition areas between legs. “We finished. That may sound like a joke, but that is actually a big step for the three of us,” said Martin. “This race is not a ‘beginner’ race, each stage is very challenging. The cheers from the crowd as each of us finished our legs were very rewarding and humbling.” Clint Barkley is a single leg amputee and completed the bike ride portion of the race, using a handbike for the 40 kilometer leg. As a former Marine, he served two tours in Iraq and during his second, was injured and lost his leg above the knee. “Events like the Tin Man allow us to demonstrate to ourselves and to others that, although we may face serious obstacles in our lives, we can persevere over those limitations and accomplish great things,” said Barkley of the experience. “Participating in the Tin Man Triathlon gave me a great sense of purpose and accomplishment.” While serving in Afghanistan an improvised explosive device (IED) struck his vehicle, causing him to lose both of his legs. Martin is now back on duty with the Arizona Highway Patrol and competes in marathons to stay in shape. “Doings things like this triathlon are incredibly important to help in the recovery process. Learning how to walk again was a challenge in itself, but taking that next step and competing again is a huge boost to the self-confidence of everyone involved,” said Martin. “We appreciate DI’s support and hope to participate in more events like this in the future.” Herbst, a single-leg amputee, completed the 750 meter swim. While working in Iraq, Herbst’s vehicle in was struck with an IED and he sustained significant injuries to his left leg. One of the event’s highlights came as Herbst emerged from the water and the crowd responded by cheering enthusiastically. “I can’t thank the individuals at DynCorp International enough for reaching out and allowing me to be a part of this event. Completing this triathlon was so motivating for us and we hope we’ve inspired others with life-changing injuries,” said Herbst. “When Andy came out of the water the crowd went wild cheering for him, but he was so focused on getting his prosthetic leg on he did not realize all the cheering was for him. It was not until people started reaching out to pat him on the back and Michael Warren pointed it out, that Andy knew the crowd was excited not just about all the swimmers coming out of the water, but to see an amputee stepping up and meeting this challenge,” commented Martin.",Public

" At DynCorp International, whether at work, or on our own time, we encourage our employees to reflect the Company’s core values – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform and We Do the Right Thing. Working in 35 countries around the world provides DI with unique opportunities to give back to the communities where team members live and work. One way DynCorp International employees show “We Care” is by working with local organizations such as the USO of Metropolitan Washington, participating in events that benefit active-duty military personnel’s families, and volunteering for Habitat for Humanity. This year DI partnered with the USO-Metro to support “Operation Back to School”, which provided backpacks filled with school supplies to approximately 3,000 local military children in kindergarten through 5th grade. The DI offices in Falls Church and Alexandria, Va. served as drop-off locations for school supply donations, and employees then volunteered to help stuff and distribute the backpacks. Members of the DynCorp International Intelligence Training & Solutions business area team volunteer at a local Habitat for Humanity ReStore. The store accepts donations of new and gently-used building materials, sells them to the public at below retail price, and applies the proceeds toward the building of Habitat for Humanity homes. DynCorp International employees also show “We Care” by supporting U.S. troops in Afghanistan through their work with the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP). Earlier this year, DI’s Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) team organized great activities for those serving in Afghanistan. At FOB Zangabad, for example, the MWR team kept the members of the military who are stationed there entertained with a karaoke night, video game tournaments, and their own weight lifting competition. DynCorp International’s collective efforts to give back led to a nomination for the 2012 Outstanding Corporate Citizen of the Year award from the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce. Developing an overall company culture based on core values is a priority to DI team members and is often seen as a perk for those seeking a career with DynCorp International. Not only are employees given opportunities to succeed at their jobs, but also to contribute to local communities.

" DynCorp International was a proud sponsor of this year’s USO-Metro Operation Back to School. The program provides backpacks complete with school supplies to approximately 4,000 local military children in kindergarten through fifth grade. DI participated in all three phases of this year’s program by collecting supply donations, volunteering to stuff backpacks with supplies and then volunteering at the final events held at Fort Belvoir and Fort Meade. The first phase of “Operation Back to School” involved donating school supplies throughout the month of May at DI offices in Falls Church, Va. and Alexandria, Va. Team members donated markers, crayons, composition notebooks, pencil holders, scissors, glue sticks and pencil sharpeners to this great cause. Several DI team members also volunteered their time to join other USO volunteers at the USO warehouse located on Fort Belvoir to fill backpacks with school supplies. Two large assembly lines worked together to add tags to the backpacks, stuff each with donated supplies and prepare for distribution at both Operation Back to School events. Then, on August 4, nearly 40 DI employees participated in Operation Back to School backpack distribution events at Fort Belvoir and Fort Meade.  Volunteers set up stations with fun activities that incorporated core subjects such as reading, math, science, history, art and physical education. Upon registration, the “students” received a report card listing each subject to be stamped upon completion at each station. After completing all stations they presented their report cards to receive a USO backpack filled with school supplies. Operation Back to School not only aims to excite children about preparing for the upcoming school year, but it also assists with the costs of school supplies, which can often put a financial strain on a family, especially when they have more than one child.

" As part of DynCorp International’s work in support of the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP), the Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) team organizes great activities for troops serving in Afghanistan. On Easter, the dining facilities (DFAC) team at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Spin Boldak brought a taste of home to the resident warfighters with a traditional Easter dinner. The dinner menu included ham, grilled Cornish hens, candied yams, a fruit display and typical Easter basket treats. The dining area was also decorated festively, with spring flowers and linen tablecloths. MWR personnel organized a unique bench press competition at Camp Stone. The goal for the competitors was to lift 80 percent of their body weight as many times as they could without raising any part of their body off the weight bench. Winners were divided by division – light weight, middle weight and heavy weight – and earned fun prizes while a mix of soldiers, coalition forces and DI personnel cheered them on.

" DynCorp International is featured in an article in the July 2012 issue of Military Logistics Forum. The article highlights DI’s innovative supply chain model which combines proprietary technology and concentrated supply chain operations into a system that is being used to fulfill supply needs for all the company’s customers. DI’s Eric George, senior vice president, Supply Chain, discusses the model and explains its functionality. “We were able to put a supply chain in place that [incorporates] the entire [supply] life cycle,” said George. “It’s the entire piece, not just one thing. I would say we have a very progressive idea of what a supply chain is. It’s truly the whole gambit of everything a company would need to buy in terms of services all the way to endgame of the delivery.” DI’s Supply Chain revolves around a centralized Supply Chain Center of Excellence (COE), allowing a consistent source of controls and logistics for the entire Company’s needs. The COE manages cost analytics, e-sourcing and targeted sourcing, ultimately providing cost savings for customers. The article highlights the importance of leveraging a unified supply chain effort in cutting costs.  Supply efforts are also evaluated through a supplier rating system to ensure efficient supply management, which George says provides “exponential improvements in procurement.” DI’s senior leadership also reviews these scorecards monthly for individual companies, and performance updates are provided to suppliers as needed. The article also describes the DI supply chain “hub and spoke distribution operation” – a system that consolidates supply transport and quality control at two Quality Control Centers (QCCs), one in Texas and another in Dubai.  QCC personnel manage all materials received, perform inspections and ship to appropriate customer locations worldwide. DynCorp International’s Supply Chain model has been cited as a positive factor in streamlining processes and plays a key role in protecting core businesses, delivering existing capabilities to new customers, and delivering new capabilities to existing customers.

" DynCorp International senior financial director, Evonne Ruiz, is highlighted in the Summer/Fall issue of Hispanic Career World Magazine. In an article entitled “Serving Your Country: Careers in Government and Defense Contracting,” Sandra H. Shichtman profiled four individuals who have developed careers within the government or defense contracting. Growing up in the Texas Rio Grande Valley, Ruiz thought she would follow her family tradition and work in pharmaceuticals. However, she found finance and accounting to be more her calling and switched her major at the University of Texas- Austin accordingly. On the recommendation of one of her college counselors who had sent other students to the Company in the past, Ruiz came to DI as an intern. She worked the summer between her junior and senior years and then continued as a part-time employee until her graduation in December 1998. Her role as an intern included basic accounting tasks such as: reconciling accounts, balance sheets and cash accounts. Her hard work paid off and after graduation she was hired as a full-time accountant.  Since then she has moved up the ranks to her current role as senior financial director where she currently handles high-level tasks such as forecasting, budgets, and operating plan financials for all of DynCorp International’s government operations. Ruiz’s says the most challenging aspect of the job is staying abreast of financial issues that might impact a company that operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Ruiz is driven in all she does by the Company’s mission to provide quality services to the U.S. government. This includes not only her accounting work but also her excellent communication skills, people skills, and flexibility as she works with personnel across the globe. She credits the help and understanding of her husband to balance such a challenging business role with her personal life. Hispanic Career World Magazine, published by Equal Opportunity Publications (EOP), was launched in 2001 as the recruitment link between Hispanic students and professionals and the employers that seek to hire them. Hispanic Career World offers career-guidance columns, news, and feature articles that profile Hispanics in all fields.

" DynCorp International has been ranked tenth in Washington Technology’s Top 100, up from 12th in 2011. Citing reengineered business processes, corporate infrastructure, increased functional back office capabilities, a new focus on business strategy and a bolstered supply chain function, DI has seen seven consecutive quarters of growth. “We’re a hungry company now, very agile and incredibly lean,” said DynCorp International president, Steven Schorer, commented. “We’re still working on our back office, but our infrastructure and the process model are greatly improved.” Washington Technology refers to several key re-competes in 2011, such as a $490 million contract to continue providing aircraft maintenance and logistics support at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division at Patuxent River, Md., and a $400.9 million contract to continue supporting the Air Force’s 11th Wing and 89th Wing at Joint Base Andrews-Naval Air Facility in Washington, D.C. New business highlights included a contract with NASA to provide to provide aircraft maintenance and operational support services, broadening Aviation Group business. Despite looming government budget cuts, Schorer still expects DI to continue to grow, “especially in the areas of training and support logistics for the military and the intelligence community.” “We’ve become more aggressive, more thoughtful and have a strong business process and follow-through,” Schorer said. “I think it’s made a real difference for us and our customers and it will continue to make a difference.” The Washington Technology 2012 Top 100 is based on an analysis of data from the Federal Procurement Data System–Next Generation. Washington Technology aims to capture the range of technology work and mission expertise that contractors provide to the federal government. Many of the codes might not seem directly related to systems integration or information technology (IT), but IT is what gets the work done. As part of the analysis, mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures are also factored in. Washington Technology is the brand for government contractors, systems integrators, and solution providers. For more than a quarter century, government systems integrator and solution provider management has relied on Washington Technology’s coverage for the key issues facing contractors:  government initiatives and their effect on spending priorities and RFPs, procurement regulatory changes, technology evaluation and analysis for proposal preparation, as well as merger & acquisition news, business trends, and arrivals and departures within the government integrator community.",Public

" DynCorp International team members support the U.S. Air Force/Air Education and Training Command (AETC) at the Sheppard Flight Support Division at Sheppard Air Force Base (AFB) in Wichita Falls, Texas. DI provides aircraft maintenance support for the 80th Flying Training Wing at Sheppard AFB. The mission of the Air Education and Training Command’s (AETC) 80th Flying Wing is unique, providing undergraduate pilot training for the U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies in the Euro NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training program (ENJJPT). The program, established in 1981, is the world’s only multi-nationally-manned and managed flying training program. Graduates of this prestigious program are assigned to fighter pilot positions in their respective air forces.

Team members manage scheduled maintenance, ground handling, servicing, launch and recovery, on-and off-equipment back shop support and transient maintenance, including crash damaged or disabled aircraft recovery. During a recent Consolidated Unit Inspection (CUI) by the AETC Inspector General, the 80th Flying Training Wing received an overall “Excellent” rating and DI’s contractor maintenance team received the highest possible score from the inspectors. “We are proud to not only support the U.S. Air Force in this essential program, but are also proud of the DI team’s commitment to excellence and the professionalism they exhibit at Sheppard,” said Jim Myles, vice president of DynCorp International’s Aviation Group. This CUI was the first of its kind for AETC, combining the Inspector General Compliance Inspection, the Logistics Capability Assessment Program, the Airfield Operations Compliance Inspection and the Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Visit. Consolidated Unit Inspections (CUIs) combine numerous evaluations and assessments from multiple agencies to obtain a comprehensive view of a wing’s compliance with mission directives. Oscar J. Padeway, the Deputy Director of Inspections for the Air Force Inspector General, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force, believes the CUI initiative could possibly reduce the current number of inspection days from approximately 350 days in a five-year period to as few as two weeks in a two-year period. “The overall goal of the Consolidated Unit Inspection is to reduce the number of functional inspections, assessments and evaluations imposed on a Wing by integrating or synchronizing them with IG inspections; this will give units more time to train and sustain a constant state of readiness,” said Padeway.",Public

" Wounded in Iraq, Clinton Barkley returned home wondering, “Now what?” He found the ideal next step, and a warm welcome, at DynCorp International. Barkley represents the thousands of men and women who, having served their country in Iraq or Afghanistan, return home wondering how they will fit in and where they will find meaningful work – not just a job, a purpose. Barkley knew from childhood that he wanted to join the U.S. Marine Corps and he joined immediately after graduating from high school. He was drawn to the travel and adventure and of course, to serve his country. A week before boot camp graduation, the unexpected happened – the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred. He was immediately compelled to do whatever he could to serve his country, eventually serving two tours in Iraq; he was wounded during the second. Today, as senior operations coordinator supporting the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) in Afghanistan, he is a valued member of the DI team. His skills and experience are a perfect fit for the program’s requirements and DI is a company where he can build a career. More than 65 percent of DI employees have served for some period of time in our country’s armed forces and the Company’s global recruiting team actively seeks veterans who enhance the quality of service we bring our customers. Veterans bring technical skills, experience, and an appreciation for a values-based culture, dedication and leadership that help secure a better tomorrow. Most importantly, their values are consistent with DI’s – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform, We Do the Right Thing. Barkley’s personal journey is compelling. In a brief video interview, he discusses his service as a Marine Corporal, his passion to continue to support the U.S. mission and the dedicated employees at DynCorp International who are engaged worldwide in important and meaningful work, and how they are united with a higher purpose of serving today for a better tomorrow.",Public
" For the sixth consecutive year, DynCorp International has been recognized by the National Veteran-Owned Business Association (NaVOBA) as one of the 10 best corporations to support and partner with veteran-owned businesses. This prestigious award, which will be the cover story for the April 2012 issue of Vetrepreneur magazine, honors corporations that most successfully employ the country’s three million-plus veteran-owned businesses as suppliers. NaVOBA President Chris Hale describes the significance of this recognition by saying, “The Top 10 corporations that earn a spot on this exclusive list are the best in the U.S. at recognizing how well the military prepares business leaders through teaching leadership, teamwork, resolve, integrity and ingenuity.” DI knows both the importance and the value of working with veteran-owned businesses. As DynCorp International chairman and CEO Steve Gaffney stated, “Sixty-five percent of our workforce is made up of veterans and our ties with the veteran community are incredibly strong.” Gaffney believes that the dedication and experience of veterans as employees, partners and suppliers helps provide top-level support to the company’s global initiatives of defense, diplomacy and development. Their solid experience and knowledge are invaluable assets in today’s economy. NaVOBA is proud to support and encourage veteran business owners. Since 2007, NaVOBA has worked to unite the more than 3 million veteran-owned businesses in the U.S. by advocating for the important issues that affect these companies. Because of NaVOBA’s efforts, the number of FORTUNE 1000 companies seeking veteran-owned suppliers has increased by over 60 percent. At present, one of every seven veterans in the country is a business owner, which is about twice the national average, and over 160 of the world’s largest corporations use veteran-owned businesses as preferred vendors. As a global government services provider delivering solutions for defense, diplomacy and international development, DynCorp International knows that good suppliers are essential to the success of its varied operations throughout the world.

" DynCorp International employees participated in the last Welcome Home a Hero Day event at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) in Dallas, Texas on Sunday, March 11. The program comes to an end as the U.S. Army is consolidating troop arrivals through Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Ga. “The overwhelming amount of support delivered to our troops at DFW over the past eight years will be forever remembered, and our mission to support the troops that continue to transit through DFW will continue indefinitely,” commented Jeff Fegan, CEO of DFW Airport. The Welcome Home a Hero Program was established in 2004 to encourage and support deployed military members. Approximately 150 to 275 troops come through DFW airport every day on their way home for two weeks of rest and recuperation (R&R). A small portion of these troops meet their families at the airport in Texas, while the majority will catch connecting flights home. Volunteers gather each day to be there to welcome these troops off their flight, thanking and encouraging them for their service to the U.S. The majority of those arriving are coming from Afghanistan and Iraq. Volunteers typically arrive dressed in red, white and blue with signs of encouragement, balloons and American flags. The USO facility at DFW Airport will continue to serve troops, even after the end of scheduled R&R charter flights. Troops will continue transiting through DFW individually or in groups on their travels between the United States and the theater of operations in the Middle East, and will continue to receive support at DFW. The “Welcome Home a Hero” program has been nationally recognized as a model for civic participation and grew into one of the largest public service projects in the Dallas/Fort Worth area.

" When Phil Bossert, who was working as an advisor to the Afghan Ministry of Defense as part of DynCorp International’s support of the Combined Security Transition Command – Afghanistan (CSTC-A), was diagnosed with a cold and sinus issues, his fellow team members weren’t convinced that was the root of his sickness. “My team at DI as well as the military team in the NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan basically ordered me to stop gutting it out and seek a second opinion at the clinic. In the end, these team members actually helped saved my life,” said Bossert. DynCorp International personnel quickly coordinated for transportation from Kabul, Afghanistan, to Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where it was found that Bossert’s “cold” was actually a brain tumor. After early detection, the tumor was successfully removed and Bossert recovered fully. Bossert credits his successful diagnosis and recovery to the DI teams working Kabul and in the U.S. “My team lead was an exceptional leader whose special operations background was obvious in his people-oriented and mission-focused leadership style. When I was transported to Walter Reed, he immediately shipped all my personal and professional gear to my home in Texas, kept my wife informed, and took over my advising duties without skipping a beat. A fellow advisor loaded my backpack with items that carried me through to Walter Reed. Another colleague escorted me to the clinic and shouted over the roar of the Medevac helicopter rotor blades, ‘Hang in there, Phil; everything is going to be all right,’ which meant a great deal,” said Bossert. Bossert’s program manager supported him by following-up with phone calls to the clinic and then later on during recovery. Bossert also received one-on-one support from the DI Care Employee Assistance Program (EAP). EAP ambassador, Donald Tate, contacted Bossert’s wife and provided constant updates on his condition, while April Spence, human resources, remained in close contact with his family for all their needs.  Michael Warren, VP, Human Resources – Employee Assistance Programs, visited Bossert at home during recovery and answered any questions he and his family had. “DI’s professionalism and its commitment to its values deeply impressed us and made this ordeal bearable. I want to express the deepest appreciation to all those at DynCorp International who helped save my life.  I want to assure DI employees worldwide, especially those in harm’s way, that DI will spare no effort to help them anytime, anywhere, especially if they get hurt or sick,” said Bossert.",Public
" DynCorp International this year showed it support for the families of our soldiers with a $5,000 donation to The Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC). For more than ten years, this global, non-profit organization has focused on its goal to ensure “quality educational opportunities for all military children affected by mobility, family separation, and transition.” Military children face unique challenges. Many move an average of six to nine times while in grade school and some may face being separated from a deployed parent. MCEC’s mission is “to ensure inclusive, quality educational experiences for all military children affected by mobility, family separation, and transition.” MCEC supports military children by performing research, developing resources, conducting professional conferences and developing and publishing resources for the children of servicemen and women, including extended family members.

The bike ride was organized 11 years ago by a small group of Chesterfield County Police Officers. The ride originally included a small contingent of volunteer riders and has grown into a large annual gathering of officers from Chesterfield County Police Department, Richmond Police Dept., Virginia Tech University Police Dept., Virginia Commonwealth University Police Department, and the Richmond Capitol Police. The ride begins at the Richmond Capitol each year during the morning of May 13.

" A recent article from Stars and Stripes credits DynCorp International’s heath care provider, Onsite OHS, for saving the life of an Afghan man. Onsite OHS works as a subcontractor with DI to provide health care to team members in Afghanistan. Abdul Aman Hirjartullah, a 26-year-old Afghan trash hauler and father of two, was bitten in the leg by one of the many dogs roaming the country. Fearing that the dog was rabid, Hirjartullah went first to the local bazaar for treatment but none was available. His next stop was Forward Operating Base (FOB) Apache where he encountered OHS Medic Cory Kraus who knew immediately that rabies treatment was needed. Typical rabies treatment involves a tetanus shot, an antibiotic, and a series of Rabivert rabies vaccine, all of which were available and administered. What was not easily obtainable says the article was HRIG, or human rabies immune globulin. The medicine is only available at a few medical facilities in Afghanistan, needs to be handled properly and can cost up to $1,200 per dose. However, Kraus knew that HRIG would be essential in saving Hirjartullah’s life because he had never received an anti-rabies vaccine. Kraus’ supervisor, physician assistant, Bill Weiss of FOB Tarin-Kowt, coordinated with the hospital on Kandahar Air Field that had the medicine. Weiss worked with a colleague at OHS, Mark Caplin, who manages all the OHS medics in the Kandahar region. In about half a day, Caplin had the HRIG delivered to Kraus who administered it to his patient. Weiss commented on the coordination efforts saying it was “truly an impressive example of civilian-military cooperation” that very likely saved the Afghan’s life. DynCorp International teams take great pride in going the extra mile to continually meet the company’s core values: We serve, We care, We empower, We perform, and We do the right thing, always.",Public
" As a police advisor supporting the U.S. Civilian Police (CIVPOL) contract with the U.S. State Department’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) in South Sudan, Michael Taylor is not only mentoring officers in the South Sudan Police Force, he is also making an impact in the local community. In working closely with South Sudan police officers, he was told about a young orphan girl, Jackoline, who lived in poor conditions in a local village. Jackoline was well-known in the community as the “running girl,” for her ability to run long distances. Touched by her story and wanting to help the local community, Taylor coordinated with various aid agencies in South Sudan to get Jackoline accepted into school and placed in a better living environment. “Michael is a dedicated police advisor always looking for ways to improve the living and working conditions of the South Sudanese people, so it comes as no surprise that he would be compelled to help Jackoline,” commented James Morrill, DynCorp International manager, CIVPOL – Haiti, Sudan & Palestine. Taylor supports the U.S. State Department’s Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) CIVPOL contract as part of the Sudan U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). In his current role, he mentors the South Sudanese police force on the importance of respecting human rights.

"  At a Wharton Aerospace Conference, DynCorp International Chairman and CEO Steve Gaffney discussed the company’s strengths and plans for the future. DynCorp International has more than 25,000 personnel working in 35 countries and 150 locations. The company’s history is in aviation but today it offers a wide array of services including training and mentoring, international development, and intelligence training solutions. DI’s primary objective is to provide the U.S. and its allies with defense, diplomacy and international development solutions to reinforce national security and foreign policy objectives around the world. Gaffney feels that leadership attributes define an intentional culture of a company, and it will be the people, leadership, and culture that will be the discriminator for DI going forward. Creating a positive culture is a priority at DI; this creates loyal employees who work harder and develop loyal customers creating profitable growth. DynCorp International encourages a culture based on shared core values that include we serve, we care, we empower, we perform and we do the right thing. Strong leadership attributes build strong teams, inspire commitment and deliver results. This is why DI reviews and assesses its employees on the basis of results and behaviors and has defined specific leadership attributes to teach managers and supervisors how to bring out the best in their teams. In addition, the company has created a social contract for team managers and members which includes respecting the opinions of others and utilizing open, honest communication. As Gaffney stated, “team members who feel good about their teams will outperform competitor’s teams who don’t focus on these important attributes.” Gaffney believes that in a service company your people are your products. The “artifacts” left behind are not tangible items but rather the stories about the people who delivered the mission. He wants the DI stories to be that all employees were committed to the mission, leaned forward, and treated others with respect. As combat missions decline and diplomatic missions increase, Gaffney believes that the company has a good mix of services that cover combat, non-combat and reconstruction operations. And as Gaffney stated, it’s the best team that generally wins at the end of the day. To find out more about DynCorp International’s services, strengths, and culture, follow DI on Twitter.",Public

It shows that, even in a difficult economy, we can achieve amazing results and positive job growth.” CSTI is based in McLean, VA. and provides customer service solutions in engineering and acquisition, knowledge management, international support and logistics and base operations. As part of its mentoring role, DynCorp International provided CSTI with coaching and training in areas such as new market development, international operations and global logistics.  DI also provided CSTI with expertise and guidance to expand their business internationally – resulting in a revenue increase from $5 to $32 million in just 18 months and created more than 100 jobs by helping them to expand the overall base of their marketplace participation. “The mentoring assistance the DI team has offered has been core to our success over the past year and a half,” said Eric Adolphe, President, CSTI. “In a period of months, we have grown into a prosperous global operation, and matured the organization into one able to responsibly manage that exponential growth.” The awards will be presented at the 16th annual Nunn-Perry Awards Ceremony at the 2012 Mentor-Protégé Conference, Wednesday, March 7, 2012 at 7:30 p.m., at the Virginia Beach Convention Center in Virginia Beach, VA. The prestigious Nunn-Perry Award, named in honor of former Senator Sam Nunn and former Secretary of Defense William Perry, was first awarded in 1995 to recognize outstanding Mentor-Protégé teams formed under the auspices of the DoD Mentor-Protégé program. Since 1991, the Department of Defense (DoD) Mentor-Protégé Program (MPP) has offered substantial assistance to small disadvantaged businesses. By helping them to expand the overall base of their marketplace participation, more jobs and increased national income can be produced. The DoD Mentor-Protégé Program assists small businesses (protégés) successfully compete for prime contract and subcontract awards by partnering with large companies (mentors) under individual, project-based agreements.

" DynCorp International staff working on the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) in Afghanistan went the extra yard and helped U.S. troops at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Spin Boldak celebrate Super Bowl Sunday. DI’s food service staff provided a full Super Bowl XLVI party complete with a big screen television, refreshments, finger foods and desserts. “DynCorp International’s Dining Facilities (DFACs) staff wants to make sure that the warfighters get a taste of home by bringing special events – like the Super Bowl, holidays, and other occasions – to Afghanistan,” said Allen Penrose, Project Food Service Manager at DynCorp International. Spin Boldak’s DFAC Manager, Barbara Wilson, and her dedicated team worked together help the troops celebrate. “Event planning always starts at least two months beforehand with the planning of the meal and decorations that would accommodate the function.  Once the meal is ordered, the DFAC managers start brainstorming ways to make the occasion unique for the personnel on base.  For this event, the warfighters were treated to pizza, wings, meatballs and onion rings – everything you would find at a typical Super Bowl party in the U.S.,” explained Wilson. As part of the LOGCAP IV program in Afghanistan, nearly 1200 DI team members work on the food service team which operates 37 full-service dining facilities. “The DI personnel that serve on the Food Service team bring a lot of experience, skills and specialized talents. They collectively used their creativity and expertise to put together a meal that the warfighters truly enjoyed,” said Allen Penrose, Project Food Service Manager for LOGCAP IV. DynCorp International serves as one of the three contractors that supports the U.S. and Coalition troops overseas under the LOGCAP IV contract. Among task orders awarded to DynCorp International on LOGCAP IV, the company supports the U.S. Army in Southern Afghanistan. Under this task order, DI “is providing existing bases with operations and maintenance support, including facilities management, electrical power, water, sewage and waste management, laundry operations, food services, and transportation motor pool operations,” as well as construction services for other sites.",Public
" Dozens of DynCorp International team members in Fort Worth, Texas, joined together to help the north Texas area by holding a winter blood drive on January 27, 2012. One pint of blood can save up to three lives, so donations from the drive will benefit more than 120 people! DI sponsored the event with Hillwood and Tarrant County Community Colleges in accordance with National Blood Donor Month. All donations directly benefit North Texas residents, collected through Carter BloodCare. “We are proud to work with Carter BloodCare and have the chance to directly benefit the community here in Texas. It’s always refreshing to see how many people come out to the drives we hold each year and participate,” said Amy Jones, administrative specialist and Employee Assistance Program (EAP) ambassador at DynCorp International. Carter BloodCare was founded in 1998 by the merger of two local blood centers, making Carter BloodCare Texas’ largest blood center. In April 2007, Carter BloodCare also merged with Tyler, Texas-based Stewart Regional Blood Center. Together, they provide more than 330,000 units of lifesaving blood to North Central and East Texas each year. Carter BloodCare is a not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) organization that operates on behalf of patients and their loved ones in 54 Texas counties. Since 1970, January has been known as National Blood Donor Month. January is a challenging time for blood donation because winter weather and busy post-holiday schedules can make it difficult for blood donors to keep appointments. Regardless of the time of year, hospital patients nationwide need about 44,000 blood donations daily for cancer care, surgeries, and the treatment of serious diseases and trauma. Just one pint of blood can help save up to three lives. Blood donation organizations encourage donors to make and keep appointments during National Blood Donor month and hold events such as winter blood drives to support donation efforts. Last August, DynCorp International participated in a similar event in Falls Church, Va., the “Give the Gift of Life” blood drive, operated by Inova Blood Donor Services. A blood mobile was on site as DI employees contributed to the largest hospital-based blood-collection operation in the country. The DynCorp International values that are applied daily to job performance – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform, We Do the Right Thing – are also values that are carried into the communities where DI lives and works. Employing tens of thousands of people around the world provides DI with unique opportunities to give back through philanthropic donations, local training programs and hands-on volunteer work.

" “From the moment I received notification of my husband’s injuries in Afghanistan while he was employed with DynCorp, I was given the best possible treatment and information from DynCorp’s EAP staff,” said Julieann Robertson. The DI Care Employee Assistance Program (EAP), is a program designed to support DI employees and their families – providing special assistance in a range of circumstances, from an employee injury or in the tragic event of a fatality. This program supports the DI core value “We Care.”  The initiative highlights how DI values the safety, security, development and well-being of all of its personnel. Robertson’s husband, Thomas Robertson, a Field Mentor who had been working in Afghanistan, was injured outside Kandahar. “I was told that the EAP support staff was there for me day or night at any hour and they meant it,” said Robertson. “No matter when I called, the staff showed the utmost care, diligence, and respect for my concerns. I was given daily updates on my husband’s medical status and transportation plans, which helped alleviate much of the stress on me.” DynCorp International’s DI Care EAP is an employee-focused solutions program for employees and families providing problem solving for complex issues related to the myriad challenges employees can face related to medical benefits, post injury recovery and reintegration back into the workforce. DI Care EAP also acts as an advocate for surviving family members of employees who have been killed in action, explaining different benefits, assisting with funeral arrangements and assisting with commemoration efforts. Soon after Thomas was injured, Michael Warren, vice president of Human Resources – Employee Assistance Programs and Stephanie Gaffney, manager, Employee Assistance Programs, contacted Julieann to assist. “No matter what the question was, both Mike and Stephanie were willing to help find the answer and worked diligently to make sure everything was taken care of and in order,” Robertson said. “Having all of the transportation, hospitalization, doctors, and nurse manager care lined up before my husband arrived back in the United States was a major help and allowed me to focus on our family instead of the red tape and paperwork.” When Nelson Stacy Croft, also a Field Mentor who was working in Afghanistan, was injured, Donald Tate, Civilian Police Advisor (CIVPOL) program EAP Officer, was there to support Croft’s family. Tate stayed in constant communication with Karen Croft, Nelson’s wife, keeping her updated on her husband’s condition. With the help of the DI Care EAP, Croft underwent complete rehabilitation and was even able to redeploy to Afghanistan. The best part, said Karen Croft, “he’s working without disabilities. “One cannot imagine going through an ordeal like this without someone to keep one grounded. I would like to thank DynCorp International for having such a great program in place to be sure their wounded are taken care of properly.”",Public
" In October 2009, DynCorp International launched the DI Care Employee Assistance Program (EAP), an advocacy program providing special assistance should an employee be wounded, or to help families in the tragic event of a fatality. This program supports the DI core value – We Care.  The initiative highlights how DI values the safety, security, development and well-being of employees. Michael Warren, VP, Human Resources – Employee Assistance Programs, said, “The DI Care Employee Assistance Program (EAP) provides a central point of contact and dedicated staff for employees and families. This program represents our company values in action.” DI Care EAP is an employee-focused solutions program for employees and families providing problem solving for complex issues related to the myriad challenges employees can face related to medical benefits, post injury recovery and reintegration back into the workforce. DI Care EAP also acts as an advocate for surviving family members of employees who have been killed in action, explaining different benefits, assisting with funeral arrangements and assisting with commemoration efforts. The program is divided into an acute (1 to 4 weeks), intermediate (up to 24 weeks) and long-term (several months to several years) support system. It includes: We have graduated a network of Human Resource DI Care EAP Ambassadors through professional training at the National Victims Assistance Academy. These EAP Ambassadors are standing by, ready to help employees and families. These Ambassadors are also assigned as Family Liaison Representatives (FLR) to provide employee/families with personal assistance. Because DI team members work in challenging and austere environments, DI Care EAP also provides support in unique areas such as for post-traumatic stress disorder, insurance claim assistance, vocational rehabilitation and education/awareness programs. Emergency Communication System – DI Care EAP utilizes the American Red Cross Emergency Communication Messages system which relays objective, timely, confidential and verified information by authorized third parties about emergency situations involving employees their immediate families. 24/7 Access to Solutions –  Through INOVA Employee Assistance, DI Care EAP provides a 24 hour, 365 day-a-year helpline.

" For the fifth year in a row, DynCorp International (DI) has been selected by G.I. Jobs magazine as one of the of the nation’s Top 100 Military-Friendly Employers®. This year DI ranked number 14 on the list. CEO Steven F. Gaffney says, “Veterans are an essential part of the DI team. They understand our customers’ challenges, have the right skills and work ethic, and share our values. We are honored that so many who have already served our country choose to join the DI family to continue their careers.” Companies on the G.I. Jobs annual list are drawn from a sample of an estimated 5,000 companies (those with more than $500 million annual revenues). The ranking is based on company criteria including the strength of company military recruiting efforts, the percentage of new hires with prior military service, and company policies toward National Guard and reserve service. In its ninth year, the G.I. Jobs Military Friendly Employers® list serves as the primary benchmark of corporate recruiting programs aimed at veterans. The annual survey conducted by G.I. Jobs magazine is a key tool used to determine the nation’s most Military Friendly Employers®. “Appearing on the G.I. Jobs Top 100 Military Friendly Employers® list is recognition of these companies’ hard work and their allocation of resources to recruiting from this invaluable employee base,” said Sean Collins, Senior Brand Manager for G.I. Jobs. DynCorp International recognizes the experience and dedication that veterans contribute to DI’s business, as employees, business partners, and suppliers. DynCorp International currently has numerous job openings in varying job skill categories, including management, government and information technology. DynCorp International hires specialists from all types of military backgrounds and offers support staff positions in many areas, including human resources, contracts, procurement, compliance, finance, accounting and administration.

The 2011 honor is the fifth year in a row DynCorp International has made NaVOBA’s list. The reputable list acknowledges “large corporations that most successfully engage the nation’s three million veteran-owned businesses (VOBs) as suppliers,” NaVOBA stated in an online news release. NaVOBA is a nonprofit organization of return vets that fosters career and network opportunities for VOBs. “DynCorp International takes creating contracting opportunities for veteran-owned business seriously with the ‘vetrepreneur-friendly’ philosophy coming directly from the highest levels of the company,” said NaVOBA in the April 2011 cover story of its magazine, Vetrepreneur.",Public
" DynCorp International LLC, staff in Kandahar, Afghanistan, celebrated Halloween by donating their time and treats to U.S. military personnel. At Kandahar Air Field (KAF), employees spent an evening after their shifts assembling goody bags of assorted candy, letters and small toys sent from stateside family and friends, and handing them out to the men and women who serve our country. The bags – along with a smile – were distributed to U.S. military personnel at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Baylough.  Sherry Prine, Logistics Civil Augmentation Program IV (LOGCAP IV) Contracts Compliance Manager, organized the effort and is also responsible for organizing several events on the base throughout the year. Much of the goody bags’ contents were sent to Kandahar from students and faculty at J.E. Turner Elementary in Wilmer, Ala. and Jim Thorpe Elementary in Henderson, Nev., who donated assorted candy, handwritten letters and cards. Families and friends of DynCorp International staff who ship care packages during the holidays to pass out to the troops also contributed to the goody bags’ contents. “Thanks to the generosity of  those at J.E. Turner Elementary and Jim Thorpe Elementary as well as DI team members from all over the world, we were  able to provide enough candies, cards, and a hand written letters to each of the warfighters stationed at FOB Baylough,” said Prine. The Halloween event was organized to help brighten the holiday for U.S. service men and women. As with any good idea, it started with one person who wanted to do something good and evolved into something bigger. Others joined the plan, asking stateside contacts to send baked goods. Boxes and bags were collected until a few days before Halloween and photos were taken throughout the day. Prine and a team of volunteers from the LOGCAP IV program visited the Role 3 Multinational Medical Unit, KAF’s military hospital, badging offices, Army Post Office, and boardwalk areas to distribute goody bags until everything was handed out. With each contact with a troop member, DynCorp International staff would say, “Thank you for your service.” Said Prine, “The gifts were given away fast, but the memories the volunteers collected during that brief time will last.” Beyond the DI Core Values of: We Care, We Serve, We Empower, We Perform and We Do the Right Thing, DynCorp International team members aim to support those serving in the Armed Forces in any way possible.

" DynCorp International team members located at the Falls Church, Va. headquarters and Alexandria, Va. offices will be participating in this year’s Food for Others Thanksgiving Food Drive. Food for Others collects items necessary for a complete Thanksgiving meal and puts together baskets that will provide a full holiday meal for families in the Northern Virginia area. DynCorp International team members will be donating canned potatoes, canned fruit, gravy, stuffing mix and other non-perishable items to complete the Thanksgiving meal baskets. Last year, DI donated more than 215 lbs. of food and $220 in gift cards for turkeys to Food for Others. Established in 1995, Food for Others serves families in the Northern Virginia area that may need food donations when an emergency strikes, and for the growing number of working poor who are unable to make ends meet and need to supplement their inadequate food supplies. Food for Others obtains much of its food through food rescue operations and food drives. Through food rescue operations, staff and volunteers pick up non-expired food items that would be otherwise thrown away from local grocery stores and other retail food establishments. The food is brought to the warehouse for temporary storage, including refrigeration as appropriate. Food drives contribute to most of the non-perishable food supply. Food for Others’ mission is to obtain and distribute free food to those in need in the Northern Virginia area and to support food programs of other community-based organizations. Food for Others also provides a channel for people to volunteer their services and help their neighbors in need. Local merchants, the USDA, food drives, and crop harvests provide the food; volunteers and staff provide the hands; and charitable contributions and fundraising events provide the funds. Charitable contributions provide a major part of Food for Others’ budget. About 96 cents out of every revenue dollar is used for program expenses. The DynCorp International values that we apply to our job performance – We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform, We Do the Right Thing – are also values that we carry into the communities where we live and work, especially around the holidays. It is a priority to DI team members in Falls Church, Va. and Alexandria, Va. to support our neighbors in the Northern Virginia area by participating in activities like local food drives.

DI team members from the PSD program have participated in the 5K walk, which raises awareness for the fight against breast cancer, for five years in a row. Those who participated also raised more than $5,000 for the cause and earned a Silver Team ranking. This year’s participating team also sold t-shirts representing the American Cancer Society-Florida’s theme, “Put on Your Pink Bra,” and a portion of t-shirt sales were also donated to ACS.  DI team members walked for friends, family members and survivors who have battled breast cancer. The actions demonstrated by DI team members at PSD, which fall under DynCorp International’s Air Operations business area team, work to embrace DI’s core values, “We Serve, We Care, We Empower, We Perform and We Do the Right Thing.” Since 1993, nearly five million walkers across the country have raised more than $340 million through Making Strides events to help funding groundbreaking discoveries into cancer’s causes and cures. American Cancer Society donations to this cause have helped fund major breast cancer research breakthroughs, including: In 2011, the American Cancer Society launched the “Put On Your Pink Bra” campaign, empowering women across Florida to wear pink bras in support of the fight against breast cancer and as a personal symbol of their breast cancer journey.

" Representatives from DynCorp International (DI), the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) and Hargrave Military Academy gathered on October 15, 2011 at the Hargrave Military Academy’s Parent’s Day Parade, in Chatham, Va., to honor Darrell L. Wetherbee, who was killed while serving as a police advisor for DynCorp International in Iraq in 2006. Cadet Dakota Wetherbee, Darrell L. Wetherbee’s son, accepted the DI Chairman’s Valor award on his behalf. Cadet Wetherbee was joined by his mother, Sheila Wetherbee, sister Stephanie Mahone, brother Clay Mahone, grandmother Brenda Mahon and grandfather Eddie Mahon at the ceremony. Darrell L. Wetherbee, 46, was killed on September 17, 2006 while on duty as a police advisor. Wetherbee, a former police officer from New Gloucester, Maine had been deployed in Iraq working for DynCorp International under the U.S. Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement’s (INL) civilian police contract (CivPol). He had participated in two previous civilian police missions, serving with the International Police Mission in Kosovo from 1999 – 2000 and 2001 – 2003. Before his deployment to Iraq, Wetherbee was also employed by the Freeport, Maine, Police Department and the State of Maine Judicial Branch. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1978 to 1986. David Dobrotka, DI VP CIVPOL Iraq Program Manager, presented the family with DI’s President’s Valor Award.  In presenting the award, Dobrotka cited an excerpt from the poem, “For the Fallen,” by Laurence Binyon: They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:  Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.  At the going down of the sun and in the morning,  We will remember them. Dobrotka also stated that the U.S. Government brings law enforcement officers like Wetherbee to the battle field and post-conflict regions because they represent all that is good and righteous about democratic policing in the U.S. The State Department’s Walter Redman, Chief Police Advisor, INL- Office of Criminal Justice Assistance and Partnerships, noted that, “While we pay tribute to the memory of our fallen friend and colleague – Darrell Wetherbee, who lost his life in service to his country – we also honor the service of all US law enforcement officers who are currently in missions around the world and those who have served in the past. INL addresses the issue of  transnational crime by assisting to strengthen governments and their criminal justice systems around the world to help keep us all safer at home.” Stephanie Gaffney, DI Manager of Employee Assistance Programs presented red roses to Sheila Wetherbee and Brenda Mahon, saying “the red roses represent respect and courage, we honor his memory and we know he is with us in spirit.” BG Don Broome, USA (Ret.), Hargrave president, stated, “The Parent’s Weekend parades feature an opportunity for families, especially the mothers, to pin academic stars on their son’s military blouse. To have the DI valor award posthumously presented to Cadet Wetherbee was fitting as it represents the highest calling of service. At Hargrave Military Academy, education is not limited to the classroom, but extends deeply into the areas of character development, leadership and spiritual growth.” DynCorp International’s Chairman’s Valor Award is the highest honor DI can bestow upon an employee.  It is presented to those who have exemplified bravery and heroism in the execution of their responsibilities in austere environments and in performing dangerous work.  This medal reflects the core values of our company: we serve, we care, we empower, we perform, and we do the right thing.",Public
" DynCorp International, through the Army Aviation Association of America (AAAA), provides scholarships to college-level students ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 annually. The awards are technically administered by the AAAA Scholarship Foundation, Inc., which began providing financial assistance for AAAA members in 1963. According to their website, the AAAA Scholarship Foundation recognizes “that one of the nation’s most precious resources is its children.” For this reason, the scholarships are provided to family members of current and deceased AAAA members, including spouses, unmarried siblings, unmarried children and unmarried grandchildren. The scholarships, which can be either a grant or a loan, are awarded on the basis of academic merit and personal achievement. Since 1963, the Foundation has provided more than $4 million to about 2,500 people, including $279,500 to 187 applicants in 2010. The individual awards of up to $10,000 each year are given out as one-, two- or four-year scholarships. Interest-free loans of up to $4,000 ($1,000 a year) are also available. Naomi Marie Perez, a valedictorian in her 2011 high school class in Enterprise, Alabama, was awarded a DynCorp International Scholarship in the amount of $1,000. The award, Perez’s 5th scholarship in 2011, was a matching grant after Perez increased her ACT score to 31. Perez’s parents said, “Naomi achieved the highest G.P.A. possible through the years, attended an exceptional school system and graduated ranked number 1 (together with 14 other valedictorians) out of almost 450 Enterprise High School seniors.” You or someone you know may qualify for an AAAA Scholarship if: The Army Aviation Association of America (AAAA) was formed in early 1957 by a small group of senior aviation officers in the active Army, the Reserve Forces of the U.S. Army, and Industry.

" October is Breast Cancer Awareness month and one way DynCorp International is showing that “DI Cares” is through a “Blue Jeans for Breast Cancer” week, Oct. 17-21. DI team members who wish to participate may donate $5 for each day or $20 to wear jeans for the entire week.  The money raised by DynCorp International offices in Ft. Worth, Texas and Falls Church, Va. will directly benefit the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation. Donations will help fund breast cancer research, education, screening and treatment programs. Earlier this year, DynCorp International employees participated in another breast cancer-related fundraiser, the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure. Similar events are taking place throughout October in offices all over the United States. Sparked by the success of Lee National Denim Day, linking jeans with breast cancer awareness has been an easy way to support this great cause. Lee National Denim Day first took place in 1996, when several Lee Jeans employees realized that each of them, in one form or another, had been touched by breast cancer. An idea was sparked and led to the creation of Lee National Denim Day, which has become one of the largest single-day fundraisers nationwide for breast cancer. In its first year, Lee Jeans set a goal of raising $1 million on Lee National Denim Day. To do this, Lee Jeans invited companies to go casual for a cause, inviting employees to wear their jeans to work on Denim Day in exchange for a $5 contribution to the fight against breast cancer. Lee National Denim Day has raised more than $83 million for the fight against breast cancer. The Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation was founded in 1982 by Nancy G. Brinker, Susan G. Komen’s sister. Brinker was inspired by her sister, who throughout her battle with breast cancer, spent her time thinking of ways to make life better for other women in similar situations. Since Komen’s passing, Brinker has developed the Susan G. Komen for the Cure® foundation into a global leader for the breast cancer movement, investing more than $1.9 billion to breast cancer research. Today, the Komen foundation is the world’s largest grassroots network of breast cancer survivors and activists, working together to save lives, empower people, ensure quality care for all and energize science to find the cures. Events like the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure® and the Susan G. Komen 3-Day for the Cure®, and generous contributions from partners, sponsors and supporters have contributed to the foundation’s success. A global government services provider that supports U.S. national security and foreign policy objectives, DynCorp International participates in many community and global efforts to support nonprofit organizations that seek to improve health and offer assistance to U.S. military, veterans, and their families.",Public
" Through a five year commitment, DynCorp International has donated $500,000 in support of the National Museum of the United States Army to the Army Historical Foundation. As a proud supporter of the U.S. Military, DI continues its support of the United States Army through this foundation. The Army Historical Foundation was established in 1983 as a member-based, publicly supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving the history and heritage of the American Soldier. The foundation’s motto is “Preserve the heritage…educate the future,” and also describes its mission. The Foundation seeks to educate Americans to fully appreciate the sacrifices that generations of American soldiers have made to safeguard the freedoms of the United States. The foundation operates on donations and funds from memberships and grants. Supporting the National Museum of the United States Army is the foundation’s main initiative. In 2000, the Secretary of the Army designated the Foundation as its primary partner in the building of the National Museum. Foundation funding also helps to refurbish historical Army buildings, acquire and conserve Army historical art and artifacts, support Army history educational programs, research, and publication of historical materials on the American soldier, and provide support and counsel to private and governmental organizations committed to the same goals as the Foundation. The purpose of building the National Museum of the U.S. Army is to provide a place to the story of the U.S. Army comprehensively and pay tribute to the personal and professional sacrifices of its soldiers. The Army’s historical artifacts, artwork, and documents will be showcased properly for the benefit of the American public. The Museum will preserve, study, and exhibit Army history, including an estimated 750,000 artifacts and works of art. A series of chronological galleries and thematic galleries will convey the everyday lives of soldiers during times of peace and war. “Service and Sacrifice” will be the dominant theme throughout the Museum. Galleries will show the Army’s strength as an agent of peace and nation-building. Soldiers have conducted countless missions in the areas of exploration and discovery, science and technology, communications and cooperation, and recovery and disaster relief. The main building will be approximately 175,000 square feet. Outside this facility will be a park with a memorial garden and parade ground. Space is being planned to accommodate ceremonies, reenactments, lectures and educational programs. Additionally, space in the Museum will be available to veterans for conferences and reunions.

" DynCorp International sponsors Veterans Moving Forward (VMF), a non-profit foundation providing trained service dogs to veterans with physical and mental health challenges. VFW trains comfort, therapy or assistance dogs to meet veterans’ needs, and DI is proud to sponsor “Josh,” the foundation’s first assistance dog in training. Josh, now just over one year old, is named after Lance Corporal Joshua Michael Davis, U.S. Marine Corps, who was killed in Afghanistan in May of 2010. VMF names all of its assistance dogs in training (ADITs) after a fallen sailor, soldier, airmen, Marines or Coast Guardsmen. Josh is an AKC Labrador Retriever, bred by a Vietnam era veteran.  Michael C. Turner, Josh’s handler, is also a Vietnam era veteran. When not with his handler, Josh works as a VMF “demonstration dog” for the program, educating veterans, military personnel, families and health care teams about the benefits of service dogs.  He also participates in therapy work and “animal assisted activities” and “animal assisted therapy” at Walter Reed Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. “We are extremely thankful for DynCorp International’s recognition of our vision to be the most effective and trusted resource for canine therapy for veterans,” said Karen Jeffries, executive director of Veterans Moving Forward. Veterans Moving Forward was founded by Karen Jeffries and Bob Larson. Jeffries, a service-disabled veteran with 24-years of experience in the U.S. Navy, spent 18 months raising and training an assistance dog with the hope that he would be placed with a veteran. Larson, an entrepreneur, managed the construction of an outpatient clinic for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Both wanted and needed to further serve veterans and together, they created Veterans Moving Forward. VMF’s unique canine program addresses the dramatic, unfulfilled needs of our veterans and service members. VMF’s dogs have visited wounded military service members at area hospitals, in addition to participating in therapy sessions with veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and educating veterans’ service organizations about the need for more fully-trained service dogs. “Our veterans put themselves in harm’s way for this country, and we want to do what we can to assist them when they return home. DI is proud to support Veterans Moving Forward’s important work to train and provide therapy and service dogs to veterans with PTSD, traumatic brain injury and other injuries incurred in the line of duty,” said Steve Gaffney, DynCorp International CEO.",Public

Volunteers typically arrive dressed in red, white and blue with signs of encouragement, balloons and American flags. Visit the Welcome Home a Hero Program’s Facebook page for updates and more information. DFW has assisted thousands of men and women since the first R&R flight arrived in November of 2004. Members of the community are invited to greet the arriving troops at the Airport and to continue this proud tradition of supporting the U.S. Armed Forces. Past participants include corporations, youth groups, schools, civic organizations, religious groups and individuals.

" ABC News crew members were on hand four years ago as current DynCorp International employee Mark Little suffered what he calls the worst day of his life. Then a 2nd Lt. in the Army, Little was serving in Iraq when he was injured by a roadside bomb – eventually causing him to lose both his legs. The bomb detonated as he was making his way to deliver supplies. While his injury may have devastated most, ABC News captured a then 24-year-old who hadn’t lost his sense of humor, even during an incredibly difficult moment. Even while suffering, he joked about what his mother’s initial reaction would be. “I had been underplaying what I was actually doing in the deployment, ‘oh I am sitting around in a secure area, I am working in a warehouse,’ not to worry her, I thought this going to be trouble, she is going to know I wasn’t sitting in a warehouse,” Little recalls. In his recent interview with ABC News, Little was just as positive and light hearted as he was the day of the incident, but this time standing proudly on prosthetic legs. “It’s just the way I am,” Little says. “It’s easier to smile than cry and you don’t accomplish anything by complaining.” Beyond his personal accomplishments of not only getting back to an active lifestyle running, walking and even playing hockey, Little participates in the 46th Special Forces Company (ABN) Association and USA Warriors Ice Hockey team. The 46th Special Forces Company (ABN) Association, which operates out of Thailand, raises money for Wounded Warriors to travel on R&R with their families. The association sells Purple Heart shirts and hats through their online store and is able to send families on cruises and other vacation destinations. Little also participates in the USA Warriors Ice Hockey Program, which operates exclusively for charitable and educational purposes, for wounded United States Military personnel in conjunction with the USA Disabled Hockey Program. The non-profit program provides a recreational, therapeutic and motivating experience for participants while educating the general public about disability sports and sacrifices made by the U.S. military. “There is a reason for everything that happened that way,” Little says. “And during that process of forming who I am right now, as I sit here to talk to you, I got more of the traits that my wife fell in love with, so imagine had that not happened, we’d be sitting here on very different terms, decidedly single and unhappy, versus what I am right now, which is the happiest I could imagine, nothing could be better.” Today, Little works with DynCorp International in the Intelligence Training & Solutions business area. Darin Powers, VP, Intelligence Training & Solutions, said of Little, “He is an amazing individual and we are honored to have him as part of our staff.”",Public
" DynCorp International firefighters from the Camp Leatherneck Fire Department joined troops from across Regional Command Southwest to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and honor those lost while assisting victims. Their 9/11 cookout was featured in Defense Video & Imagery Distribution Systems News. “We try to do cookouts periodically to give back to the military members … to say thank you,” said Jaime J. Jimenez, Camp Leatherneck Fire Department chief and DynCorp International employee. “When the firefighters came to me and said that they wanted to do one on the 9/11 anniversary, I said we should do it … and the support we’ve had from all units around the camp has been incredible.” “It is an honor for me to serve alongside troops out here in Afghanistan because I know what it’s like to wear the uniform,” explained Jimenez, who retired after twenty years as a firefighter in the U.S. Air Force. “I thank God every day for having the opportunity to be out here protecting them and helping them, just because they protect us every day.” Keeping the memories alive can be very emotional for some, but for the troops and firefighters at the event, it was a moment to feel proud and focus on the mission and duty, Jimenez affirmed. Michael J. Gaul, also a DI employee and Camp Leatherneck Fire Department captain, shared his thoughts. “September 11th is a very emotional day for all the firefighters, to remember the 343 firefighters who gave their lives during 9/11 … they are in our memories,” explained Gaul. “But events like this cookout will help us keep all the people who passed away during the attack in our minds.” “The idea is to share in commemoration of the 10 years and enjoy time together to think back and remember why we are here,” Gaul said. The Camp Leatherneck Fire Department serves as first responders to various crises on the 1,600-acre base located in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. The fire department works closely with the Combined Aid Station and Provost Marshall’s Office to serves the military and civilian contractor outfits on base. Jaime J. Jimenez and Michael J. Gaul work at Camp Leatherneck under the LOGCAP IV program, implemented by the DynCorp International Contingency Operations business area.

" DynCorp International (DI) today announced that it has been awarded a contract with the United States Navy for the operation and maintenance of Communication Suites aboard Military Sealift Command vessels. “We are honored that the U.S. Navy has chosen us for this important contract, expanding our relationship with the Navy and highlighting our experience in the communications space,” said George Krivo, vice president of DI’s Operations and Maintenance Business area. The competitively-awarded, fixed-price contract has one base year and four option years with a total contract value of $20.9 million if all options are exercised. This is the third consecutive award of this program to the company; the first award of this contract to the company was in July 2001, for five years, with a second follow-on award in Oct 2006, again for five years. Under the new contract, DI will provide operations and maintenance services on three maritime prepositioning squadrons and up to nine Joint High Speed Vessels (JHSV), with the first JHSV beginning October 1, 2011 out of Mobile, Ala. The U.S. Navy’s Military Sealift Command (MSC) is the premier provider of ocean transportation to the Department of Defense. The command operates approximately 110 noncombatant, civilian-crewed ships that replenish U.S. Navy ships, conduct specialized missions, strategically preposition combat cargo at sea around the world and move military cargo and supplies used by deployed U.S. forces and coalition partners. MSC is organized around four mission areas representing their primary operations: MSC’s mission is to support the U.S. by delivering supplies and conducting specialized missions across the world’s oceans. A Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) is capable of transporting personnel, equipment and supplies in support of maneuver and sustainment operations. The JHSV would be able to transport Army and Marine Corps company-sized units with their vehicles, or reconfigure to become a troop transport for an infantry battalion. The JHSV would include a flight deck for helicopter operations and an off-load ramp that would allow vehicles to quickly drive off the ship. The Joint High Speed Vessel (JHSV) would operate at speeds up to four times greater than the current fleet. This would provide the Army with the capability to support operational maneuver from standoff distance, bypass land-based choke-points, and reduce the logistics footprint in the Area of Responsibility. This ability to transport both troops and their equipment, and to provide an En route Mission Planning and Rehearsal System, did not previously exist.",Public

Despite challenges in the government contracting industry, the company earned a spot in the top 20 with $3 billion in prime contracts, a renewed focus on partnerships, and a jump in work from the federal government agencies. Highlighting the fact that the company’s services have diversified, now meeting key needs of all U.S. global engagement across defense, development and diplomacy, DynCorp International president Steven Schorer commented, “We’ve positioned ourselves for transition.” Dyncorp International recently acquired Casals and Associates, now DI Development, to increase the company’s reach in international development; and Phoenix Consulting Group, now its Intelligence Training and Solutions business area, which brings the company into the intel space.

" Major General Jeffrey Buchanan, Director of Strategic Effects, J9, was at the Center for a New American Security headquarters in Washington, D.C. last week to discuss “Operation New Dawn: Bridge to an Enduring Partnership.” In his discussion, he described his experience in training police forces in Iraq, the improvements in the Iraqi police force and implications for the future. “Month to month, year to year, it is very rewarding because you see the changes from a long term perspective. The light bulbs do, in fact, go off. So the Iraqi military and security forces we have now are very different than the ones we saw in the past. This is one of the things that causes me to be hopeful for the future,” said Buchanan of his experience working with Iraqi police officers. Buchanan also made remarks on specific examples of how Iraqi police has improved, citing, “they recognize and they regularly take on what their weaknesses are, what their needs are. They look at their performance very closely when they conduct operations and maybe even more importantly, when it doesn’t go well,” said Buchanan. “What they do now is a pretty thorough critique of themselves and apply what they learn.” Buchanan attributes the developments in Iraq to having the right personnel on site, proper preparation and the importance of training during this transition. Buchanan previously served as the Senior Light Infantry Trainer for the National Training Center, the Director of Combat Development at the U.S. Army Infantry Center where he deployed as the Director of Operations, Coalition Military Assistance Training Team, an organization charged with manning, training, and equipping the Iraqi Armed Forces.

The service will be conducted at the Purple Heart Monument in Sparkman Park in Hartselle, Alabama on Saturday, August 6th at 10:00 a.m. Each fallen warrior’s name is read, accompanied by a bell ringing. In addition, a Purple Heart flag is given to a relative or friend if present. A Veteran’s Walk is also held, open to all veterans.

" For the fifth year running, DynCorp International LLC (DI) was again in 2011 recognized as one of the United States’ 10 best corporations for veteran-owned businesses. In 1946, DynCorp International was founded by World War II veterans. The company continuously recognizes the experience and dedication that veterans contribute to their business as employees, business partners and suppliers. “Veteran-owned businesses bring key expertise to our missions supporting defense, diplomacy, and development initiatives around the world,” said chairman and CEO Steve Gaffney. “The dedication and discipline they showed in their service to our country is also evident in their business practices making veteran-owned businesses reliable, first-rate partners and suppliers.” Each year, the list compiled by the National Veteran-Owned Business Association (NaVOBA) recognizes the corporations that most successfully engage the nation’s three million veteran-owned businesses as suppliers. DynCorp International LLC continually comes out on top. To learn more about our proud veteran-owned American business that supports progress and development, visit DynCorp International LLC.",Public
" While DynCorp International (DI) is gaining important government contracts, its employees are also gaining prestige among the top government committees. In February 2011, DynCorp International’s Darrell Coleman, director of trade compliance, was appointed to the President’s Export Council Subcommittee on Export Administration (PECSEA). “Darrell’s leadership and expertise on compliance issues are great assets to DI and we are thrilled that his valuable experience will now be shared through the PECSEA,” said DI chief compliance officer Joe Kale. The President’s Export Council is the principal U.S. national advisory committee on international trade. Its subcommittee, PECSEA, is composed primarily of representatives from the private sector and appointed by the Secretary of Commerce to provide advice and counsel on issues involving U.S. export control policy and matters related to security and global competitiveness. Mr. Coleman’s participation and expertise will no doubt strengthen the voice of service providers as manufacturers are traditionally well-represented on the PECSEA. Mr. Coleman is very excited for the opportunity saying, “Export control is equally important to service companies and I look forward to presenting a service-provider’s point of view on issues related to our country’s export of goods, technology and services.” The PECSEA advises the U.S. government on matters and issues pertinent to implementation of the provisions of the Export Administration Act and the Export Administration Regulations, and related statutes and regulations. These issues relate to U.S. export controls as mandated by law for national security, foreign policy, non-proliferation, and short supply reasons. The expertise and direct input of PECSEA’s members are vital to provide advice and recommendations on possible ways to minimize any adverse export controls imposed on U.S. industry; especially with the fact that PECSEA’s representatives are from the broad range of industries that are directly affected by export controls. DI supports the improvement and development of matters related to security and global competitiveness. For more information, visit DynCorp International.",Public
" In January 2011, DynCorp International (DI) was one of the first companies in the government services sector to receive the Capability Maturity Model® Integration for Services (CMMI-SVC) Capability Level 3 for not only its program management system, but also for the support and organizational processes across the company’s two major operating segments, Global Stabilization and Development Solutions, and Global Platform Support Solutions. Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute (SEI), in partnership with the Department of Defense, developed the CMMI as a process improvement model to provide a blueprint for companies to develop and improve their project management processes. Under the best circumstances, the practices in the model itself focus on ways to provide quality services to a company’s customers and end users. “This is a huge achievement for our company, providing tremendous value to our customers,” said Steve Gaffney, DynCorp International LLC chairman and CEO. “As one of the few government services providers to achieve this rating across our business, it is a testament to our commitment to excellence and reinforces our competitive position.” If you are interested in learning more about DI in the government services sector contact DynCorp International today.",Public
" In November 2010, G.I. Jobs magazine ranked DynCorp International (DI) number 11 on their list as one of the nation’s Top 100 Military-Friendly Employers® up from number 22 on last year’s list. Chosen from about 5,000 companies with more than $500 million annual revenues, the ranking is based on company criteria including the strength of company military recruiting efforts, the percentage of new hires with prior military service, and company policies toward National Guard and reserve service.

The annual survey conducted by G.I. Jobs magazine is a key tool used to determine the nation’s most Military Friendly Employers®. In announcing the list Rich McCormack, who heads G.I. Jobs’ list research, said, “This isn’t about charity or patriotism. It’s about good business. The companies on our list understand that.” “We are proud to make this list for the fourth year in a row and are extremely fortunate to have so many brave Americans who served their country now working at DI,” said Bob Lehman Jr., DI’s senior vice president for Human Resources. “The leadership qualities that these individuals bring to our company are invaluable and it is an honor to have them as colleagues.” Founded by World War II veterans, DynCorp International LLC provides services for governments and industry worldwide.

" In the Fall of 2010, the Washington Business Journal recognized DynCorp International (DI) as one of 2010’s 50 Fastest Growing Companies in the Washington, D.C. Region. The ranking was based on an evaluation of continued growth over the three-year period between 2007 and 2009 by determining the companies that had the highest percentage of revenue growth; DI was ranked number 46 out of 50 and was the largest company on the list. In announcing the list, Washington Business Journal publisher Alex Orfinger said, “The companies that make this list are, by definition, among the most dynamic in our region. In 2010, they beat the odds imposed by the Great Recession, making membership on this elite list all the more impressive. These companies show all of us what qualities it takes to grow in challenging times.” CEO Steve Gaffney highlighted the importance of teamwork in continuing to grow DynCorp International after 60 years of supporting the U.S. government. “This rank was the direct result of a great deal of hard work by the entire DI team,” said Mr. Gaffney. “Growth, especially in such tough economic times, comes from high-performing people who are committed to delivering for our customers. I am proud to be part of such a dedicated team.” DI continues to grow through a culture of teamwork and by honoring their commitment and values to always demonstrate the highest standards of integrity whether dealing with their customers or co-workers.

The projectiles and explosive components turned in were serviceable and could have been used in a future attack. This discovery may correspond to recent propaganda that has been found in Bayji citing that the '%%% Revolutionary Brigade planned to increase attacks on Coalition Forces throughout %%%. Though it is possible that these %%% are linked to a planned surge by the '%%% REV Brigade, it is highly unlikely. The story provided by the Local National responsible for their discovery seems to be flawed and exaggerated.

BEFORE DEPARTING THE JSS, THE TEAM WAS INFORMED THAT AN Improvised Explosive Device HAD DETONATED IN FRONT OF THE FIRST VEHICLE OF A ROUTE %%% PATROL THAT WAS HEADED SOUTHEAST ON Route %%%. THE Explosive Ordnance Disposal TEAM ARRIVED ON SCENE AND SET UP A SAFE AREA AT %%%. THE LEAD VEHICLE IN THE PATROL WAS AN UNMANNED High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle Humvee WITH THE %%% IN THE SECOND VEHICLE. THE %%% STATED THAT THE Improvised Explosive Device DETONATED -%%% METERS AHEAD OF THE UNMANNED High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle Humvee ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE ROAD BETWEEN A LARGE OPENING IN THE BARRIERS. THE TEAM REMOTELY CLEARED THE AREA OF SECONDARY DEVICES AND PROCEEDED TO CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF THE SITE. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE, A DETERMINATION OF WHAT THE Improvised Explosive Device CONSISTED OF COULD NOT BE MADE. THERE WAS NO FRAGMENTATION OR LEFT OVER RESIDUE TO INDICATE WHAT TYPE OF INITIATION SYSTEM THE DEVICE CONTAINED. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE BLAST SEAT CRATER, THE Explosive Ordnance Disposal TEAM LEADER ASSESSED THAT THE DEVICE CONTAINED APPROXIMATELY -%%% Pounds OF Unknown Bulk Explosives. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO PREVIOUS ATTACKS AT THE SAME SITE. THE FIRST ATTACK HAPPENED ON 15april09 AND THE SECOND HAPPENED ON 28april09. BOTH Improvised Explosive DeviceS CONSISTED OF %%% THAT WERE COMMAND WIRE INITIATED. THE FACT THAT THE Improvised Explosive Device WENT OFF IN FRONT OF THE FIRST VEHICLE INDICATES THAT THE Improvised Explosive Device MAY HAVE BEEN EITHER Reserve Component OR Passive Infrared INITIATED. ALTHOUGH THIS AREA IS HIGHLY KNOWN FOR COMMAND WIRE INITIATING SYSTEMS, ANOTHER ATTACK ON 19MAY09 ON Route %%% AT GRID %%% WITH AN Improvised Explosive Device THAT DETONATED AFTER THE LAST VEHICLE PASSED IT PRODUCING A SIMILAR RESULT OF NO Battle Damage Assessment AND LITTLE TO NO EVIDENCE, INDICATES THAT A NEW Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures IN THIS AREA COULD POSSIBLY BE BEING TESTED. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO ANY VEHICLES, BARRIERS, OR BUILDINGS. BECAUSE THIS SITE IS NOW FREQUENTLY BEING USED TO %%% Improvised Explosive DeviceS, COMPLETELY BLOCKING OFF THE OPENING WITH ADDITIONAL BARRIERS WOULD BE ADVISABLE TO PREVENT FURTHER ATTACKS FROM THE SAME PLACE.

This is one more weapon which would have been used to kill the Iraqi people that is now off the streets thanks to your local police.\012\012S2 Assessment: The details, motivations, and informants involved with the discovery of the suicide vest are extremely questionable. Though the vest was indeed operational and capable of detonating if a %%% was added, the discovery of it in a field outside of %%% village raises significant concerns that the informants could not speak to, including how it was discovered, who discovered it, and how they knew it was there at %%% at night. Additionally, the informants claimed that there are two more %%% in the %%% area that %%% in the future against Coalition Forces or the informants themselves. What they failed to explain, however, is the discrepancy between the opportune discovery of one SVEST in an isolated field and their knowledge of more vests and their future use in the area. To add to the lack of clarity, this is at least the fourth suicide vest that has been discovered in this area in the past two months, the other three were turned in through the Kirkuk ISF to an %%%. In all of these instances, there has been a lack of details sufficient to explain the discoveries and the suspected involvement of the same sources and informants.
