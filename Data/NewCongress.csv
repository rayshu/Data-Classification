On August 5 2007 P.L. 110-55 the Protect America Act of 2007 was signed into law by President Bush after having been passed by the Senate on August 3 and the House of Representatives on August 4. The measure introduced by Senator McConnell as S. 1927 on August 1 makes a number of additions and modifications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) as amended 50 U.S.C. �� 1801 et seq. and adds additional reporting requirements. As originally passed the law was to sunset in 180 days on February 1 2008. On January 29 2008 both the House and the Senate passed H.R. 5104 a 15-day extension to the sunset for the Protect America Act to allow further time to consider pass and go to conference on proposed legislation to amend FISA while ensuring that the intelligence community would have the authority it needed in the intervening period. Signed into law on January 31 it became P.L. 110-182. On February 13 2008 the House rejected H.R. 5349 which would have extended the sunset provision an additional 21 days. Bills have been introduced in the Senate to extend the sunset from 180 to 210 days (S. 2541 S. 2556 and S. 2615) or to extend it to July 1 2009 (S. 2557).,Private
assesses recent international developments as the leaders from a number of nations work to reach a consensus on an informal set of best practices regarding national restrictions on foreign investment for national security purposes. also provides one possible approach for assessing the costs and benefits involved in using national policies to direct or to restrict foreign direct investment for national security reasons. Within the United States there is no consensus yet among Members of Congress or between the Congress and the Administration over a working set of parameters that establishes a functional definition of the national economic security implications of foreign direct investment. In part this issue reflects differing assessments of the economic impact of foreign investment on the U.S. economy and differing political and philosophical convictions among Members and between the Congress and the Administration.,Private
H.R. 3773 S. 2248 and the Senate Judiciary Committee's amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2248 each includes amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. provides a side by side comparison of the provisions of these three measures. A glossary of FISA terms from section 101 of FISA 50 U.S.C. � 1801 is attached. Other FISA bills have also been introduced such as S. 2440 S. 2441 and S. 2402.

"Section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 P.L. 108-458 amended the definition of ""agent of a foreign power"" in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) 50 U.S.C. � 1801(b)(1) to add a new category of covered individuals. Under this ""lone wolf"" provision a non-United States person who engages in international terrorism or activities in preparation for international terrorism is deemed to be an ""agent of a foreign power"" under FISA. This provision does not change the procedures to be used to apply for a court order authorizing electronic surveillance or a physical search under FISA. If an order is sought under this definition of an ""agent of a foreign power"" however the applicant is not required to demonstrate a connection between the target of the electronic surveillance or the physical search and a foreign nation foreign group or international terrorist group. Nor does the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) in approving such an order have to find probable cause to believe that such a connection existed. Rather if the court authorizes such a surveillance or physical search using this definition of ""agent of a foreign power"" the FISC judge has to find in pertinent part that based upon the information provided by the applicant for the order the target had engaged in or was engaging in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor. By operation of the sunset provision in Section 103 of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act P.L. 109-177 the amendment to the definition of ""agent of a foreign power"" in FISA will cease to have effect on December 31 2009.",Private
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 was enacted principally to prevent corporate bribery of foreign officials. This act had three major parts: 1. It required the keeping by corporations of accurate books records and accounts; 2. It required issuers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to maintain a responsible internal accounting control system; and 3. It prohibited bribery by American corporations of foreign officials. For a number of years after passage of the act Congress debated amending it in response to numerous criticisms. On August 23 1988 the President signed into law the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 of which Title V is known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Amendments of 1988. The Amendments maintained the three major parts of the 1977 Act but significant changes were made. One of these changes enacted a knowing standard in order to find violations of the act. This standard was intended to encompass conscious disregard and willful blindness. The amendments provided certain defenses against finding violations of the act such as that the gift is lawful under the laws of the foreign country and that the gift is a bona fide and reasonable expenditure or for the performance or execution of a contract with the foreign government. In 1998 the act was further amended in order to implement the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. These amendments expanded the scope of coverage to include some foreign persons and extended jurisdiction beyond the borders of the United States.,Private
"The President is generally seen as exercising broad discretionary authority over developing and implementing U.S. direct investment policy including the authority to suspend or block investments that ""threaten to impair the national security."" Congress is also directly involved in formulating the scope and direction of U.S. foreign investment policy and some Members are urging the President to be more aggressive in blocking certain types of foreign investments. Such confrontations reflect vastly different philosophical and political views between members of Congress and between Congress and the Administration over the role foreign investment plays in the economy and the role that economic activities should play in the context of U.S. national security policy. In July 2007 Congress asserted its own role in making and conducting foreign investment policy when it adopted and the President signed P.L. 110-49 the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. This law broadens Congress' oversight role and it explicitly includes the areas of homeland security and critical infrastructure as separately identifiable components of national security that the President must consider when evaluating the national security implications of a foreign investment transaction. The act may well draw Congress into a greater dialogue and possibly greater conflict with the Administration over efforts to define the limits of the broad rubric of national economic security.",Private
"The Constitution of the United States makes no specific allowance for any one of the co-equal branches to have access to information held by the others and contains no provision expressly establishing a procedure for or a right of public access to government information. Nonetheless Congress has legislated various public access laws. These include two records access statutes - the Freedom of Information Act (FOI Act or FOIA; 5 U.S.C. � 552) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. � 552a) - and two meetings access statutes - the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA; 5 U.S.C. App.) and the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. � 552b). Moreover due to the American separation of powers model of government interbranch conflicts over the accessibility of information are neither unexpected nor necessarily destructive. The federal courts historically have been reluctant to review and resolve ""political questions"" involving information disputes between Congress and the executive branch. Although there is considerable interbranch cooperation such conflicts probably will continue to occur on occasion.",Private
The USA PATRIOT Act sections were originally set to sunset on December 31 2005. By then both Houses had passed legislation that amended and extended the expiring sections (H.R. 3199) and a conference report resolving their differences had been issued H.Rept. 109-433 (2005). In order to provider further time for consideration the expiration date has been extended twice first until February 3 2006 P.L. 109-160 (2006) and more recently until March 10 2006 H.R. 4659 P.L. 109- (2006).,Private
As part of the war on terrorism it is widely recognized that the U.S. government has a substantial and growing need for personnel with knowledge of foreign languages and especially languages that may be spoken in limited and remote areas of the world. In 2002 the federal government employed about a thousand translators and interpreters in four agencies responsible for security-related functions. In addition these agencies employ nearly 20000 staff in positions that require some foreign language proficiency. Yet there is a widespread consensus that requirements for foreign language qualified personnel are not currently being met. The report issued by the 9/11 Commission in July of 2004 makes several references to this deficiency and suggests corrective action to address it.,Private

The Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act H.R. 5825 109th Congress was one of a number of bills introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives addressing various aspects of the TSP and a variety of approaches to electronic surveillance of terrorists and those affiliated with them. This bill was designed to enhance flexibility in electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information while requiring increased reporting and congressional oversight of these activities. The measure was introduced on July 18 2006 and passed the House on September 28 2006. summarizes the bill as passed by the House and analyzes the potential impact of its provisions were they to become law. The 110th Congress may wish to contemplate similar or different approaches to these issues or may choose to forego legislation in light of the new FISC orders and the anticipated termination of the TSP while continuing congressional oversight.,Private
The destructive aspects of foreign outsourcing are costly and distressing to those whose jobs are lost to increased imports. Therefore matters of efficiency and equity are intertwined and one of the principal challenges for policymakers in the face of foreign outsourcing (and trade in general) is to find ways to ameliorate the associated harm without sacrificing the economy-wide gains that such trade generates. Compensation for loss and adjustment assistance is thought by economists to offer the best chance for securing higher economic efficiency along with distributional equity.,Private
"The continued rise in China's trade surplus with the United States and the world and complaints from U.S. manufacturing firms and workers over the competitive challenges posed by Chinese imports have led several Members to call for a more aggressive U.S. stance against certain Chinese trade policies they deem to be unfair. Among these is the value of the China's currency (the renminbi or yuan) relative to the dollar. From 1994 to July 2005 China pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar. On July 21 2005 China announced it would let its currency immediately appreciate by 2.1% and link its currency to a basket of currencies (rather than just to the dollar). Although the yuan has appreciated 16% since 2005 many Members complain that China continues to ""manipulate"" its currency in order to gain an unfair trade advantage resulting in U.S. job loss. Numerous bills have been introduced to induce China to adopt a more flexible currency policy.",Private
The current legislative and oversight activity with respect to electronic surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) has drawn national attention to several overarching issues. briefly outlines three such issues and touches upon some of the perspectives reflected in the ongoing debate. These issues include the inherent and often dynamic tension between national security and civil liberties particularly rights of privacy and free speech; the need for the intelligence community to be able to efficiently and effectively collect foreign intelligence information from the communications of foreign persons located outside the United States in a changing fast-paced and technologically sophisticated international environment or from United States persons abroad and the differing approaches suggested to meet this need; and limitations of liability for those electronic communication service providers who furnish aid to the federal government in its foreign intelligence collection. Two constitutional provisions in particular are implicated in this debate - the Fourth and First Amendments. briefly examines these issues and sets them in context.,Private

The international investment position of the United States is an annual measure of the assets Americans own abroad and the assets foreigners own in the United States. The net position or the difference between the two sometimes is referred to as a measure of U.S. international indebtedness. Although this designation is not strictly correct the net international investment position does reveal the difference between the total assets Americans own abroad and total amount of assets foreigners own in the United States. These assets generate flows of capital into and out of the economy that have important implications for the value of the dollar in international exchange markets. Some Members of Congress and some in the public have expressed concerns about the U.S. net international investment position because of the role foreign investors are playing in U.S. capital markets and the potential for large outflows of income and services payments. Some observers also argue that the U.S. reliance on foreign capital inflows leaves the economy vulnerable to financial crises.,Private

The federal budget's return to persistent deficits after fiscal year 2001 increased and continues to increase the amount of federal government debt sold to the public. The sale of U.S. Treasury-issued debt to the public provides the government with the cash it needs to cover the gap between its income and its spending. The Treasury Bulletin (published quarterly) provides data on the amount of federal debt held by different categories of holders. The categories of holders include among others depository institutions individuals pension funds insurance companies state and local governments and foreign governments and international institutions. For this report the holdings of federal debt by the public are divided into just two categories domestic private holdings and foreign and international holdings (hereafter referred to as foreign holdings).

Federal statutes of limitation are as old as federal crimes. When the Founders assembled in the First Congress they passed not only the first federal criminal laws but made prosecution under those laws subject to specific statutes of limitation. Similar provisions continue to this day. Federal capital offenses may be prosecuted at any time but unless some more specific arrangement has been made a general five year statute of limitations covers all other federal crimes. Some of the exceptions to the general rule like those of the USA PATRIOT Act identify longer periods for particular crimes. Others suspend or extend the applicable period under certain circumstances such as the flight of the accused or during time of war.,Private

"The 109th Congress considered H.R. 5068 and S. 3938 both titled the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2006 which would reauthorize the Bank's charter for five years through September 30 2011. The House measure was introduced by Representative Pryce on March 30 2006 and was sent to the House Financial Services Committee which has jurisdiction in the House of Representatives over the Bank. The measure was approved with four amendments by the Committee on June 14 2006 and passed the full House unanimously without amendment on July 26 2006. In the Senate S. 3938 was introduced September 26 2006 by Senator Crapo and sent to the Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs which has jurisdiction.

China officials assert that they have been moving aggressively to improve their food safety system and to close unsafe plants. China in late 2007 concluded a memorandum of agreement with the United States aimed at improving the safety of traded food and feed products. Nonetheless some Members of Congress continue to express sharp criticism of both China's food safety record and U.S. efforts to insure import safety. In the 110th Congress committees on both sides of Capitol Hill held hearings on food safety concerns generally and on the China situation.

U.S. aid to the Palestinians has fluctuated considerably over the past three years largely due to Hamas's changing role within the Palestinian Authority (PA). After Hamas led the PA government for over a year its forcible takeover of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 led to the creation of a non-Hamas government in the West Bank. Since then the U.S. has dramatically boosted aid levels to bolster the PA and President Mahmoud Abbas vis-�-vis Hamas. In FY2008 Congress appropriated a total of $414.5 million in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians the largest single year appropriation ever for the Palestinians. Because of congressional concerns that among other things U.S. funds might be diverted to Palestinian terrorist groups much of this assistance is subject to legislative restrictions. For FY2009 an additional $200 million have already been appropriated for the Palestinians (with another $100 million requested by the Bush Administration). Experts advise that PA stability hinges on now more than ever improved security economic development Israeli cooperation and the continuation of high levels of foreign assistance.,Private
The The House-passed farm bill would have replaced (rather than supplemented) the current federal-state cooperative inspection programs with a new program to enable meat and poultry that is not federally inspected to be shipped across state lines so long as the state programs adopted standards identical to those of USDA along with any additional changes USDA required. The House bill also would have enabled many plants currently under federal inspection to apply for state inspection and continue to ship interstate. Opponents of this change feared that many would seek to opt out of the federal system if they believed that could receive more lenient oversight by the states - an assertion that state proponents dismissed. If the conference farm bill becomes law as many anticipate stakeholders will next turn their attention to USDA where implementation details will be determined through the rulemaking process.,Private
The Interim Cooperative Framework addresses many congressional concerns regarding development in Haiti: promotion of democratic governance and political stability; effective and transparent use of domestic and international funds; and economic development and reduction of poverty.

The nation's trade deficit is equal to the imbalance between national investment and national saving. National saving is the sum of household saving business saving and public sector saving (a budget deficit equals public sector borrowing). In the 2000s the gap between national saving and investment widened largely because of a fall in private and public saving causing the trade deficit to widen. (It fell somewhat in 2007 relative to GDP.) To finance the trade deficit foreign capital must flow into the United States. Net private capital inflows have not grown over this period however to match the widening gap between saving and investment. To finance the growing trade deficit from 2002 through 2007 official capital inflows became increasingly important as central banks in a few Asian and oil-producing countries purchased U.S. assets to moderate or prevent their currencies from appreciating against the dollar. Net official capital inflows were close to $400 billion in 2006 and 2007. If total net capital inflows should decline the dollar and trade deficit would decline U.S. interest rates would rise and U.S. spending on capital goods and consumer durables would fall all else equal.,Private

There are three main avenues for students from other countries to temporarily come to the United States to study and each involves admission as a nonimmigrant. The three visa categories used by foreign students are: F visas for academic study; M visas for vocational study; and J visas for cultural exchange. While most non-immigrants are admitted with visas that have a precise expiration date foreign postsecondary students are admitted for duration of status which lasts as long as they are full-time students or participating according to the terms of their exchange programs.,Private
Several temporary provisions affecting the taxation of capital income were adopted in the 2001-2003 period and further changes may be considered. The 2001 tax cuts provides a phased-in reduction of individual tax rates (typically around three percentage points) which are scheduled to sunset in 2010. The 2002 tax provides bonus depreciation for equipment allowing 30% of investment to be deducted immediately (with the remainder depreciated under standard rules). This bonus depreciation provision was enacted as a temporary stimulus applicable only to acquisitions before 2005. The bonus depreciation share was increased to 50% by the 2003 tax cut. This provision has now expired but it might be considered for reinstatement if fundamental tax reform is considered. Temporary tax reductions on dividends and capital gains received by individuals were also adopted in 2003. The top capital gains tax rate was reduced from 20% to 15% and dividends were also made eligible for these lower tax rates. The 2003 tax cut also accelerated some of the planned individual rate reductions in the 2001 tax cut.,Private
Trade liberalization ultimately results in gains to all economies; however there are winners and losers (both industries and workers) along the way. Worker rights provisions could mitigate the effects of trade liberalization on both groups somewhat by increasing labor costs in developing countries. However the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) as worker a worker rights promotion vehicle with a developing country has mitigated the effects of trade expansion from NAFTA very little so far because most compliance is voluntary.,Private
The reason for the pending legislation that would alter the current tax code's FSC provisions is FSC's difficulties with the WTO. U.S. trading partners in the EU have argued that FSC is an export subsidy in violation of the WTO agreements and in 1999 a WTO panel supported those claims. looks a U.S. tax laws and how they relate to the WTO agreements.

"provides a current summary of ballistic and cruise missile activity in selected countries and discusses implications for U.S. national security policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Weapons of Mass Destruction Terms of Reference Handbook defines a ballistic missile as ""a missile that is guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight when the trajectory that it follows is subject only to the external influences of gravity and atmospheric drag"" and a cruise missile as ""a long-range low-flying guided missile that can be launched from air sea and land."" Ballistic and cruise missile development and proliferation continue to pose a threat to U.S. national security interests both at home and abroad. Approximately 35 countries currently possess operational ballistic missiles of various ranges and approximately 25 countries have operational cruise missiles with a range greater than 150 km (90 miles). Some analysts consider cruise missile proliferation to be of more concern than that of ballistic missile proliferation primarily due to their low threshold of use availability affordability and accuracy.",Private

Following amendment an appellate court dismissed one of the earlier cases as moot and remanded the second for reconsideration in light of the amendments. On remand the lower federal court again held the NSLs constitutionally suspect. The decision is on appeal. A report of the Department of Justice's Inspector General found that in its early use of its expanded USA PATRIOT Act authority the FBI had ""used NSLs in violation of applicable NSL statutes Attorney General Guidelines and internal FBI policies"" but that no criminal laws had been broken.

Broad comprehensive data on U.S. multinational companies generally lag behind current events by two years and were not developed to address the issue of jobs outsourcing. Many economists argue however that there is little evidence to date to support the notion that the overseas investment activities of U.S. multinational companies play a significant role in the rate at which jobs are created in the U.S. economy. Instead they argue that the source of job creation in the economy is rooted in the combination of macroeconomic policies the nation has chosen the rate of productivity growth and the availability of resources. addresses these issues by analyzing the extent of direct investment into and out of the economy the role such investment plays in U.S. trade jobs and production and the relationship between direct investment and the broader economic changes that are occurring in the U.S. economy.,Private
"Since 2002 the dollar has depreciated against a broad basket of currencies and against the euro. This depreciation has prompted some observers to question whether the ""cheap"" dollar is leading to a ""fire sale"" of U.S. firms especially of those firms that can be identified as part of the Nation's defense industrial base. Congress has displayed a long and continuing interest in foreign direct investment and its impact on the U.S. economy. Since September 11 2001 Congress has demonstrated a heightened level of concern about the impact of foreign direct investment in critical industries or in sectors that are vital to homeland security. On July 26 2007 the 110th Congress passed P.L. 110-49 (H.R. 556) the National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthened Transparency Act of 2007. The measure reflects a heightened level of concern about the presence of foreign investors in the economy by increasing Congressional oversight over federal reviews of foreign direct investment and by expanding the current areas of review to include homeland security and critical infrastructure. The continued weakness in the exchange value of the dollar and its potential effects on direct investment likely will continue to attract the attention of Members in the second session of the 110th Congress.",Private

A long-running dispute between the United States and the European Union (EU) over U.S. export tax benefits may have reached a conclusion. For more than 30 years U.S. tax law provided a tax benefit to exporters: first as the Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) provisions; then with the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) benefit; and finally with the Extraterritorial Income (ETI) provisions. The EU maintained for virtually the entire period that the U.S. export benefits violated international trade agreements' prohibitions of export subsidies arguing that DISC violated the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later complaining that FSC and the ETI provisions violated the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements that replaced GATT. Successive attempts by the United States to redesign its export tax benefits so as to achieve legality under GATT and the WTO were not successful; GATT and WTO panels without exception ruled against the U.S. provisions. WTO rulings against the U.S. export benefits culminated in 2002 with the approval of up to $4.03 billion in retaliatory tariffs by the EU. Congress began consideration of legislation to repeal ETI and initially the EU deferred application of its tariffs. By early 2004 however the United States had not enacted repeal legislation and the EU began to phase in its tariffs in March of that year.,Private

National reconciliation has been the primary goal of President Violeta Chamorro's administration since 1990.

"Some policymakers have called for a ""stimulus"" package to boost economic activity in response to the housing downturn. A fundamental difference between stimulus proposals is how much of the stimulus should be composed of government spending and how much should be composed of tax cuts. considers that issue in the context of conventional economic analysis. It first identifies any policy change that increases the budget deficit (or reduces a surplus) and is not entirely saved by the recipient as ""stimulative"" if the economy is operating below its full potential. It then separates the short-run effects of a budget deficit from the long-run effects. In this context certain spending proposals would be more stimulative than certain tax reductions in the short run because they result in a bigger boost in aggregate spending. This advantage may come at the cost of forgone growth in the long run however.",Private

Trends in U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America generally reflect the trends and rationales for U.S. foreign aid programs globally. U.S. assistance spiked in the 1960s during President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress reflecting an interest in preventing the spread of Soviet and Cuban influence in the region and recognizing poverty as one possible root cause of popular discord. In the 1980s the U.S. focus shifted to the Central American isthmus where leftist insurgencies were challenging friendly governments and where a leftist movement in Nicaragua had taken control of government through armed combat. Substantial amounts of U.S. assistance were provided to support Central American governments and the U.S.-backed Contras seeking to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. In the aftermath of the 1989 U.S. military intervention in Panama and the 1990 electoral defeat of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua U.S. assistance to these two countries increased substantially. Central America resolved many of its political problems since then although it is still one of the least developed areas in the hemisphere. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 U.S. concerns about spreading communist influence lessened and so too did levels of U.S. assistance. Since 2000 assistance has again increased largely in the Andean region for counternarcotics programs.,Private

This analysis looks at two questions that the policy debate addresses. First what is the impact of the U.S. tax system on the flow of investment abroad? Second what would be the impact of the principal legislative proposals on that flow? It concludes that under current law the tax system poses a patchwork of incentives and disincentives for overseas investment in some cases encouraging U.S. firms to shift operations abroad in some cases discouraging overseas investment. The overall net impact of the system on incentives defines generalization. The current legislative proposals likewise contain a mixture of tax incentives for domestic and foreign investment and whether they would on balance encourage overseas or domestic investment is not clear.,Private
"The foreign tax credit alleviates the double-taxation that would result if U.S. investors' overseas income were to be taxed by both the United States and a foreign country. U.S. taxpayers credit foreign taxes paid against U.S. taxes they would otherwise owe and in doing so concede that the country where income is earned has the primary right to tax that income. But the United States retains the primary right to tax U.S.-source income placing a limit on the foreign tax credit: foreign taxes can only offset the part of a U.S. taxpayer's U.S. tax that falls on foreign source income. It is this limit to which the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-357 Jobs Act) applied. To calculate the limit a firm separates its revenue and costs for tax purposes into those having a foreign source and those having a U.S. source. Foreign taxes can offset U.S. tax on revenue ""sourced"" abroad; in effect foreign-source income is exempt from U.S. tax for firms whose foreign tax credits exceed the limit (firms with ""excess credits""). But because deductions allocated abroad reduce U.S. tax the effect is the same as if deductions allocated to foreign sources can not be claimed for U.S. tax purposes.",Private

There are several reasons why Congress might address the estate tax sooner rather than later. The law governing the estate tax over the next four years is highly erratic. The applicable exclusion amount (popularly known as the exemption) under the estate tax is $2 million for people who die in 2008. The exclusion is scheduled to rise to $3.5 million in 2009. The estate tax is repealed for people who die in 2010 only. Then because the current law governing the estate tax is scheduled to sunset on December 31 2010 the estate tax is set to be reinstated in 2011 with an exclusion of $1 million per person for 2011 and beyond.,Private

"Title VI of the Higher Education Act (HEA P.L. 89-329 as amended) - International Education Programs - authorizes a variety of grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) and related institutions for the purpose of enhancing instruction in foreign language and area studies (FLAS). This is one of the oldest continuous programs of federal support to higher education having been initiated as Title VI of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (NDEA P.L. 85-864). It played a historical role of helping to establish along with non-governmental support from certain foundations multi-disciplinary ""area studies"" departments in many colleges and universities especially during the late 1950s and 1960s. Throughout its life the program has also supported courses and programs in less commonly taught languages or world regions.1 The long history of this program reflects the special priority placed by the federal government on FLAS especially with respect to diplomacy national security and trade competitiveness. Interest in HEA Title VI and other federal programs supporting FLAS has increased recently as a result of concerns regarding terrorism arising from foreign regions which are infrequently included in American postsecondary curricula and a related interest in greater expertise in those areas. As with the rest of the HEA Title VI may be considered for reauthorization by the 110th Congress. provides an overview of Title VI programs and an analysis of reauthorization issues.",Private

International trade continues to grow in importance for the world economy as well as the U.S. economy enhancing economic well-being generally but also imposing costs on trade sensitive sectors of national economies.

examines the importance to the U.S. economy of China's investment in U.S. securities as well as U.S. concerns over the possibility that China might unload a large share of those holdings the likelihood that this would occur and the potential implications such action could have for the U.S. economy. The report concludes that a large sell-off of Chinese Treasury securities holdings could negatively affect the U.S. economy at least in the short-run. As a result such a move could diminish U.S. demand for Chinese products and thus could lower China's economic growth as well. The issue of China's large holdings of U.S. securities is part of a broader question that has been raised by many economists: What are the implications of the heavy U.S. reliance on foreign investment to maintain healthy economic growth and to finance the budget deficit?,Private
"There are three basic approaches which are not mutually exclusive to assist greenhouse gasintensive trade-exposed industries: (1) directly supporting domestic industries; (2) penalizing foreign competitors; and (3) developing alternative sectoral approaches. Importantly these are presumably transitional actions pending some international agreement that ""levels the playing field.""",Private
With expanding trade with growing emerging economies that have changing resource endowments the U.S. economy's terms of trade may move as this growth causes changes in the worldwide demand for and supply of the goods and services that the United States exports and imports. Given its current and prospective size China's impact on these forces could be large. China's main impact on the U.S. terms of trade over the last decade has been through the falling price of U.S. imports from China transmitting a favorable impulse to the U.S. terms of trade. It also seems likely that the impact of the economic growth of China on the U.S. terms of trade over the near term will continue to be dominated by the favorable effects of a falling price for imports from China. Over the longer term conclusions are more tentative. Several factors point to a favorable outcome for the United States; however some deterioration of the U.S. terms of trade may be the unavoidable consequence of successful economic development in large emerging economies such as China (as well as India Russia and Brazil). The economic benefit to the world economy from large numbers of people accomplishing the very difficult transformation from poverty to a steadily rising standard of living is great.,Private
The United States has been free of a national debt for only two years 1834 and 1835. In its first year 1790 the country faced a debt of $75 million. From FY1998 to FY2001 the federal government ran budget surpluses. Since then the budget has returned to deficit and the debt had risen to $5 trillion by 2007. It rose to a high of 108.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of World War II; declined to a post-World War II low of 23.8% of GDP in 1974; and then rose to another high of 49.5% of GDP in 1993.,Private
Conventional economic analysis suggests that the cause of the current account deficit is insufficient national saving. Because the U.S. saving rate is too low to finance national demand for physical capital investment the United States must borrow from abroad to bridge the gap. The conventional policy prescription for reducing the current account deficit has been to boost the national saving rate by reducing the budget deficit and encouraging higher rates of private saving.,Private

Laws and regulations have changed significantly since September 2001 and an Information Sharing Executive (ISE) has been established within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to design and implement information sharing procedures. It is clear however that sustaining the exchange of law enforcement and intelligence information remains a challenge. In particular there is continued concern about sharing of information that might in some way jeopardize the rights of free speech or association of U.S. persons. This opposition has contributed to the difficulty Congress has had in addressing legislation in this area and can be expected to continue. Some argue that given the extent of legislation enacted in recent years extensive oversight of information sharing efforts may be an appropriate way to ensure that the balance between ensuring domestic security and protecting civil liberties can be maintained.,Private
"Renewed congressional efforts to codify English as the ""official"" or ""national"" language by statute largely replaced the constitutional amendment approach of earlier years. This trend culminated in 1996 when the House passed H.R. 123 to declare English the official language of the United States government and restricting other linguistic usage in the conduct of ""official"" governmental business. The measure died in the Senate. Contemporary versions of the earlier measure however have appeared in subsequent legislative sessions and similar legislation has been introduced in the 110th Congress. Both H.J.Res. 17 and H.J.Res. 19 would amend the Constitution to establish English as the official language of the United States while H.Con.Res. 11 would resolve that the federal government should pursue policies that not only encourage all residents to become fully proficient in English but also encourage all residents to learn or maintain skills in languages other than English. Meanwhile H.R. 768 would prohibit the enforcement of any executive order that creates an entitlement to services provided in languages other than English while H.R. 769 H.R. 997 S. 1335 and S. 1348 would among other things declare English to be the official language of the United States.",Private

A noticeable phenomenon of the 1980s was the growth in the U.S. trade deficit to record proportions. From a slight surplus in 1980 and 1981 the trade deficit grew to a record 2.5% of GDP in 1986. The trade deficit then declined to a low of about 0.2% of GDP in 1991. It then began to rise reaching a record high of 3.9% of GDP in 2000 the last full year of the 1991-2001 expansion. The growth of the deficit was especially rapid over 1998-2000. During 1998 the deficit was 2.2% of GDP whereas in 1997 it was only 1.1% of GDP. The advent of the recession in 2001 and the subsequent recovery and expansion did not produce a decline in the trade deficit. Rather it continued to rise reaching 5.6% of GDP during 2005 and 5.4% in 2006. (In all of the computations above exports imports the difference between the two and GDP are measured in 2000 dollars.

Most crime is territorial. It is proscribed investigated tried and punished under the law of the place where it occurs. As a general rule no nation's laws apply within the territory of another. Yet in a surprising number of instances federal criminal law does apply overseas whether the accused is an American or a foreign national. As long as there is some nexus to the United States federal law authorizes prosecution - practical diplomatic and procedural impediments notwithstanding.

It begins with a description of the U.S. Social Security policy debate along with a brief comparison of Chile and the United States. Next the report explains what Chile's individual retirement accounts system is and how it works. The pension reform bill sent to the Chilean Congress for debate in 2007 is also discussed. The report does not address other components of Chile's social security system such as maternity work injury and unemployment. The final section provides an assessment of Chile's now 26-year-old individual retirement accounts system. Pension reforms have contributed to the rapid growth in the Chilean economy over the past two decades and returns on pension fund investments have been greater than expected. Administrative costs however have been high and participation rates have been modest at best. There is concern that the system does not cover the entire labor force and provides inadequate benefits to low income workers.,Private

traces out the channels through which the tax cuts are thought to affect the economy and assesses the performance of those economic indicators including gross domestic product (GDP) employment interest rates inflation labor supply saving capital investment and the trade deficit. The report uses theory and data to evaluate the tax cuts' effects through 2004. (does not analyze economic developments since 2004. Presumably individuals had adjusted their behavior to the tax changes by then and economic developments since have not been significantly influenced by tax cuts enacted several years earlier.) The report also offers an overview of the forecasts of their effects made at the time the tax cuts were passed. Most estimates predicted that the tax cuts would increase economic growth in the short-term and reduce it in the long run. Despite the wide diversity of the models used all of the results are relatively small as would be expected of tax cuts that are relatively small in relation to GDP in the years considered.,Private

The path of the dollar is symptomatic of underlying economic forces that shape and propel U.S. international transactions. Of singular importance in this regard is the waxing and waning of the world's appetite for dollar denominated assets and the associated flow of funds on international capital markets. A closer look at the several forces that influence that appetite is revealing of not only the ups and downs of the dollar but also the forces behind the large current account imbalances in the world economy (deficits in the United States and surpluses in other major economies) large asset market imbalances in the world economy (a large stock of liabilities in the United States and a large stock of dollar assets in the investment portfolios of foreigners) and the prospects for an orderly or disorderly correction of those imbalances.,Private

"provides background information regarding the cases of two U.S. citizens deemed ""enemy combatants"" Yaser Esam Hamdi who has been returned to Saudi Arabia and Jose Padilla who remains in military custody. A brief introduction to the law of war pertinent to the detention of different categories of individuals is offered followed by brief analyses of the main legal precedents invoked to support the President's actions as well as Ex parte Milligan which some argue supports the opposite conclusion. A discussion of U.S. practice during wartime to detain persons deemed dangerous to the national security follows including legislative history that may help to shed light on Congress' intent in authorizing the use of force to fight terrorism. The report concludes that historically even during declared wars additional statutory authority has been seen as necessary to validate the detention of citizens not members of any armed forces casting in some doubt the argument that the power to detain persons arrested in a context other than actual hostilities is necessarily implied by an authorization to use force.",Private

A reduced flow of credit will likely dampen economic activity that is dependent on such borrowing as residential investment spending (purchasing new homes) by households business investment spending (purchasing new plant and equipment) and consumer spending (purchasing autos appliances and higher education) by households. Residential investment spending has fallen over 40% between the fourth quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2008 and has on average subtracted about 1.0 percentage point from real GDP growth in each of those six quarters. Non-residential investment spending continued to increase in 2007 and the first half of 2008 but the pace fell steadily and in the third quarter of 2008 it declined 0.1%. Consumption expenditures had been increasing but at a decelerating rate in 2007 and the first half of 2008. However in the third quarter of 2008 consumer spending fell 3.1%. A recent study estimates that the decrement to the U.S. economy's supply of credit is about $1 trillion leading to a potential drag on real GDP of about 1.8 percentage points for two years.,Private

examines a small slice of the federal policies influencing pharmaceutical innovation: the federal tax burden on the pharmaceutical industry. The federal tax code affects private investment in new drug discovery and development in a variety of ways and these linkages form the core of the report. More specifically it analyses the industry's federal tax burden from 1995 to 2001 - the most recent year for which federal corporate tax return data are available - focusing on the provisions in the federal tax code that appear to generate significant tax benefits or penalties for pharmaceutical firms that invest heavily in R&D. The size of the industry's tax burden influences its capacity to invest in innovation. The report begins with an examination of the distinguishing traits of the pharmaceutical industry directly related to its tax treatment and concludes with a description of legislative proposals to modify some aspect of this treatment in the 109th Congress.,Private

The rate of long-term economic growth is the salient measure of the nation's ability to steadily advance its material living standard. The pace of long-term economic growth is likely to be a center of attention in the decades just ahead as the U.S. economy confronts the need to undertake unprecedentedly large generational transfers of income to pay for the retirement of the huge baby-boom generation as well as large transfers to the rest of the world to meet the debt service costs of the United States' large and still growing foreign debt.,Private
Most capital offenses are state crimes. In 1994 however Congress revived the death penalty as a federal sentencing option. More than a few federal statutes now proscribe offenses punishable by death. A number of bills were offered during the 110th Congress to modify federal law in the area. None were enacted. One S. 447 (Senator Feingold)/H.R. 6875 (Representative Kucinich) would have abolished the federal death penalty. Another H.J.Res. 80 (Rep McCollum) would have amended the Constitution to abolish capital punishment as a sentencing alternative for either state or federal crimes. Other proposed amendments would have eased constitutional limitations on the death penalty as a sentencing option particularly in cases involving the rape of children H.J.Res. 83 (Representative Broun) H.J.Res. 96 (Representative Chabot).,Private

"Manufacturing seems to be a steadily diminishing presence in the American economy producing a falling share of Gross National Product and employing a smaller share of the labor force. Many see this as a loss of something vital to providing ""good"" jobs and advancing economic well being. On the other hand deindustrialization has occurred in varying degrees in most industrial economies and can be seen as a natural outcome of economic progress and a rising living standard. When examined from the standpoint of real output and level of employment the U.S. manufacturing sector has shown considerable stability over the last 20 years. Because the apparent deindustrialization has been coincident with a rising level of international trade particularly recent increases in trade with many low-wage developing economies there is an inclination to see causality running from rising trade to a faltering manufacturing sector. Yet economic analysis indicates that while a rising level of trade can have adverse consequences for particular industries it is unlikely to adversely affect the whole manufacturing sector. Increased imports may hurt some industries but the increased exports needed to pay for those imports helps other industries. Therefore across all tradeable goods producing industries there is no net loss of jobs. Moreover exporting industries tend to pay higher wages than import competing industries.",Private
Economics tells us that a nation exports so that it may import. Exports are the cost goods and services the domestic economy must give up while imports are the benefit foreign goods and services that we wish to acquire in trade. Clearly the nation is better off if for any given volume of imports it exchanges a smaller volume of exports rather than a larger volume. The nations terms of trade is a measure of the export cost of acquiring desired imports. Increases and decreases in its terms of trade indicate whether a nations gains from trade is rising or falling. While trade is a process of mutual beneficial exchange each trading partners share of those benefits can change over time and movement of the terms of trade are an indicator of that changing share.,Private

Over the past 15 years the U.S. current account has moved from a small surplus to a deficit that in 2005 was nearly $800 billion. The final tally for 2006 has not been completed but preliminary data suggests the deficit will grow to near $900 billion. The current account deficit has increased also as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) climbing from near zero to a record 6.2% in 2005. Because a current account deficit is a reflection of a concurrent net inflow of borrowed funds from the rest of the world the accumulation of debt from a long succession of large annual deficits has caused the United States to move from being a small net creditor to the rest of the world to being a large net debtor. The net accumulation of liabilities through 2005 is $2.7 trillion which is equivalent to about 22% of U.S. GDP.,Private
One reason that Social Security reform is on the congressional agenda is the large projected long-term fiscal shortfall facing Social Security estimated at an average of 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) between now and 2080. But relatively little attention has been given to the potential long-term shortfall faced by the rest of the government which is estimated to be more than 6.5 times larger than Social Security's shortfall. The government's overall fiscal gap under an extension of current policy estimated at an average of 7.2% of GDP between now and 2080 is the result of the large projected increase in future spending that is not matched by any projected increase in tax revenue. Most of the increase in spending occurs in Medicare and Medicaid; Social Security is the third largest contributor to the fiscal gap. If viewed from the revenue side the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts increased the fiscal gap by an average of 2.2% of GDP between now and 2080. The fiscal gap measure may be useful to policymakers because it highlights the unsustainability of current policy in the long term and the potential cost of inaction and it provides a measure that can be used to estimate the implications of current policy for the macroeconomy and generational equity.,Private

"Recently the critics have urged that the multiple policy goals of the Federal Reserve (Fed) be replaced by a single goal of price stability. Critics believe that central bankers tend to use their discretionary powers to achieve political as well as economic objectives notably to create ""good times"" through monetary expansion. Since these ""good times"" do not last long such a policy imparts a costly inflationary bias to an economy and hence is not economically optimal over time. Among other virtues it is argued that a single goal would provide an explicit anchor for the American monetary system.",Private

Several members of the European Union (EU) over the past two years have been erecting barriers to cross-border mergers and acquisitions possibly in violation of their Single Market commitments. The main focus of these anti-competitive actions often dubbed economic nationalism or economic patriotism by the press is on corporate control particularly in the banking steel and energy sectors. Unlike in the 1980s when the main opposition to creation of the Single Market for goods capital labor and services came from companies resistant to being exposed to more international competition the main opposition to liberalization today comes from some member state governments (and or politicians) fearful of losing national prestige and jobs as a result of merger activity. examines the nature and significance of rising economic nationalism as well as how U.S. interests may be affected.,Private

Implementation of the security screening opt-out provision is likely to be an issue of considerable interest during the remainder of the 108th Congress. While privatization advocates are calling for an expansion of the opt-out provision to allow for greater program flexibility and less federal control of private airport screening advocates for federal control of aviation security view a return to private screening as a move that could reintroduce deficiencies in aviation security that existed before the federalization of passenger screening under ATSA.,Private
Many Members of Congress charge that China's policy of accumulating foreign reserves (especially U.S. dollars) to influence the value of its currency constitutes a form of currency manipulation intended to make its exports cheaper and imports into China more expensive than they would be under free market conditions. They further contend that this policy has caused a surge in the U.S. trade deficit with China and has been a major factor in the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Although China made modest reforms to its currency policy in 2005 resulting in a modest appreciation of its currency many Members contend the reforms have not gone far enough and have warned of potential legislative action.,Private
For security and other reasons the President Vice President and First Lady use military aircraft when they travel. The White House generally categorizes the trips as fulfilling either official or political functions. Often a trip involves both official and political or unofficial activities. When a trip is for an official function the government pays all costs including per diem (food and lodging) car rentals and other incidental expenses. When a trip is for political or unofficial purposes those involved must pay for their own food and lodging and other related expenses and they must also reimburse the government with the equivalent of the airfare that they would have paid had they used a commercial airline. When a trip involves both official and political activities a formula determines the amount to be reimbursed for that part of the trip involving political activities. Whether a trip is for official or political purposes the Air Force pays all operational and other costs incurred by the use of the aircraft. While the travel policies of specific Administrations concerning the reimbursement of expenses for unofficial travel generally are not publicly available it appears that policy guidelines developed by the Reagan White House have served as a basis for the travel policies of subsequent Administrations.,Private

Open source information (OSINT) is derived from newspapers journals radio and television and the Internet. Intelligence analysts have long used such information to supplement classified data but systematically collecting open source information has not been a priority of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC).

Increasing border and transportation security are essential strategies for improving and maintaining homeland security. Border security entails regulating the flow of goods and people across the nation's borders so that dangerous and unwanted goods or people are detected and denied entry. Transportation security entails screening and protecting people and goods as they move between different locations within the country. Determining which goods and people are permitted and which are denied entry into the United States involves a system of sophisticated border management. This system must balance the need for securing the nation's borders with facilitating the essential commerce and legitimate free flow of citizens and authorized visitors. The system must be capable of a detailed examination of the goods and people seeking entry but must still fit within budgetary constraints and be administratively feasible. Improving transportation security has meant an expanded federal role in screening passengers and baggage traveling through airports and also increasing the presence of federal officers aboard domestic and international flights. Plans exist to expand the presence of federal officers in other modes of transportation. Finally these management systems must accomplish their functions with a minimum of disruption of legitimate activities and without unnecessary intrusion into the civil liberties of persons affected by them.,Private

In the process of arguing its position at the WTO Japan made representations that its market for photographic film and paper is open.

After the repeated urging of the Department of Energy (DOE) Congress in 2006 agreed to temporarily consolidate separate counterintelligence (CI) offices at the Department of Energy and the National Security Administration (NNSA) into a single CI office under DOE control. DOE had complained that the dual office structure was ineffective. In permitting DOE to consolidate the two offices Congress reversed its 1999 authorization to establish a separate NNSA CI office-a decision that at the time was prompted by congressional concerns over repeated departmental security and counterintelligence lapses. At the same time in 2006 DOE combined its separate Offices of Intelligence and Counterintelligence into a new DOE office called the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence. The Department reasoned that combining the disciplines of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence under one integrated office would foster synergistic cooperation that would lead to a more strategic and ultimately more effective counterintelligence program. analyzes both consolidations-the first authorized by Congress at DOE's request; the second initiated by DOE-and examines the impact of each on the effectiveness of the Department's CI program. A major oversight issue for Congress is whether either or both organizational changes will strengthen the Department's CI program as intended. Some observers are concerned that the two consolidations may have undercut CI capabilities.,Private

Federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes (mandatory minimums) demand that execution or incarceration follow criminal conviction. Among other things they cover drug dealing murdering federal officials and using a gun to commit a federal crime. They have been a feature of federal sentencing since the dawn of the Republic. They circumscribe judicial sentencing discretion although they impose few limitations upon prosecutorial discretion or upon the President's power to pardon. They have been criticized as unthinkingly harsh and incompatible with a rational sentencing guideline system; yet they have also been embraced as hallmarks of truth in sentencing and a certain means of incapacitating the criminally dangerous. is an overview of federal statutes in the area and a discussion of some of the constitutional challenges they have faced.,Private

A recurring question in the debate on adding individual accounts (IAs) to Social Security is how large the typical account would be upon retirement. Making this calculation requires assumptions about the contribution rate length of time the account was held and rate of return earned on the account (net any administrative fees and taxes). Because of the power of compound interest changing the rate of return on the account leads to greatly different outcomes. For example $1 invested every month for 40 years accumulates to $1526 if earning 5% $2625 if earning 7% and $4681 if earning a 9% rate of return. Many estimates of how large the IAs would be have assumed that assets in the account would earn a rate of return equal to the historical average. For example in the official actuarial estimates of various IA plans the Social Security Administration actuaries assume that equities will average a rate of return of 6.5% and government bonds will earn 3%. Some proposals assume that the accounts would hold equities (stocks) others bonds and others some combination of the two. Since stocks historically have a higher rate of return than bonds on average the rate of return earned by the IA's would increase as the fraction held in equities increased. But is the assumption that future rates of return will mirror historical rates of return a valid one? Or are there ways in which the future may differ from the past that will have a predictable effect on the rate of return? analyzes demographic economic and financial reasons why the assumption might or might not be valid.,Private

The purpose of this report is to outline the commonalities and potential differences between EO 13354 and P.L. 108-458 as these conceptual differences could be meaningful in the implementation process of P.L. 108-458 and/or should the issue of intelligence reform be re-visited by the 109th Congress. The report examines some aspects of the law related to the NCTC including the relationship between the NCTC's Director and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) which may have implications related to policy and implementation of an effective and efficient nationally coordinated counterterrorism function. Moreover the report examines several issues that may be of interest to Congress as the NCTC matures and evolves including potential civil liberties implications of collocating operational elements of the traditional foreign intelligence and domestic intelligence entities of the U.S. Intelligence Community. While the appointment and confirmation of a DNI may resolve some of the uncertainty regarding the NCTC the NCTC is only one of a myriad of complex issues that will be competing for the time and attention of the recently nominated DNI. An issue for Congress is whether to let the existing intelligence reform law speak for itself (and let certain ambiguities be resolved during implementation) or to intervene to address apparent ambiguities through amendments to the law now. Alternatively the executive branch may choose to intervene to clarify apparent ambiguities within P.L. 108-458 or between EO 13354 and P.L. 108-458.,Private

New issues of the 30-year Treasury bond were discontinued in November 2001 based on budget projections at the time that the publicly held national debt would be retired within a matter of years. It was reasoned at the time that it would not be in the nation's interest to issue debt that would still be outstanding after the national debt had been retired and the budget had entered a period of sustained surplus. The drawbacks to discontinuing the 30-year bond were seen to be insignificant. The Treasury also discontinued other maturities such as the 20-year bond and the 3-year note in the surplus years in order to increase liquidity in the remaining maturities as borrowing needs dwindled. Since then the projections of large surpluses have been transformed into large deficits. On August 3 2005 the Treasury announced that the 30-year bond would be reintroduced in the first quarter of 2006. To evaluate the merits of this change it is useful to consider how the reintroduction of the 30-year bond would affect the cost of government borrowing the macroeconomy and the efficiency of financial markets. Before doing so it is useful to define the goals of Treasury debt management.,Private

The Administration and Congress agree on the need to invest in science and engineering research and science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in order for the United States to be more competitive with other nations. Their priorities as to which programs to fund and how much however are different. When Congress passed the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology Education and Science Act (P.L. 110-69) known as the America COMPETES Act in August 2007 much of the FY2008 appropriations debate had already taken place. As a consequence FY2008 appropriations largely failed to address the new priorities enacted in the America COMPETES Act.

Over the last decade or so concern about illegal immigration has sporadically led to a re-examination of a long-established tenet of U.S. citizenship codified in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and �301(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. �1401(a)) that a person who is born in the United States subject to its jurisdiction is a citizen of the United States regardless of the race ethnicity or alienage of the parents. The war on terror and the case of Yaser Esam Hamdi a U.S.-Saudi dual national captured in Afghanistan fighting with Taliban forces further heightened attention and interest in restricting automatic birthright citizenship after the revelation that Hamdi was a U.S. citizen by birth in Louisiana to parents who were Saudi nationals in the United States on non-immigrant work visas and arguably entitled to rights not available to foreign enemy combatants. traces the history of this principle under U.S. law and discusses some of the legislation in recent Congresses intended to alter it.,Private

Recently enacted statutes mandate better integration of ISR capabilities and require that the Defense Department prepare a roadmap to guide the development and integration of ISR capabilities over the next fifteen years. An effective roadmap if developed could potentially ensure more comprehensive coverage of targets and save considerable sums of money. To establish responsibility for an Intelligence Community-wide effort the 9/11 Commission recommended that a new position of Director of National Intelligence be established to manage the national intelligence program (but not joint military and tactical intelligence programs which would continue to be managed by the Defense Department). This position was included after extended debate in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) that was approved by the President on December 17 2004. The implications of this legislation for ISR programs are as yet uncertain but Congress may seek to assess the effectiveness of the statute in addressing long-existing concerns with ISR programs.,Private

The Before the USA PATRIOT Act federal authorities engaged in gathering foreign intelligence information or conducting an investigation of international terrorism could seek a FISA court order for access to hotel airline storage locker and car rental business records. Section 215 amended the procedure so that in a foreign intelligence or international terrorism investigation federal authorities may obtain a FISA order for access to any tangible item no matter who holds it including by implication library loan records and the records of library computer use. Although past practices have apparently made the library community apprehensive the extent to which the authority of Section 215 has been used if at all is unclear. Media accounts of federal investigations involving library patrons ordinarily do not distinguish between simple inquiries grand jury subpoenas criminal search warrants FISA physical search orders and FISA tangible item orders.

The issue that has received the most attention in post-Katrina discussions is the speed of rescue and relief operations. The Department of Defense's (DOD's) Northern Command began its alert and coordination procedures before Katrina's landfall; however many deployments did not reach the affected area until days later. An examination of the timeline of DOD's response and the decision points along that timeline could provide insight into whether the response could have been accelerated given the intensity of the storm and the extent of the destruction. Both the National Response Plan and DOD's own Homeland Security Doctrine lay out extensive procedures and specific decision points in an attempt to ensure an organized response to catastrophic incidents. It may now be necessary to examine those procedures and the actions of responsible authorities to determine whether procedural obstacles administrative failures or both delayed the arrival of needed resources in the affected area. The traditional assumption that the Department of Defense is the resource only of last resort may also require reexamination.,Private
Some in Congress and the executive branch have not been content with the changes being undertaken by the states and several proposals have been put forth over the past few years for increased federal involvement in insurance regulation.

These changes prohibit the Bank from providing loans or guarantees for exports of goods primarily capital equipment that foreign firms can use to increase their production of goods that are substantially the same as products that are subject to a countervailing or antidumping duty order under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 or a determination under title II (escape clause relief) of the Trade Act of 1974. The Bank is also required to develop a set of policies regarding exports of equipment that foreign firms can use in the production of items that are subject to a preliminary rather than a final injury determination.

Increasingly efforts to protect integral features of the natural environment that are essential to human well being face a double challenge. First the magnitude of some conventional and emerging threats to environmental quality is growing despite solid progress in controlling some causes. This is particularly the concern on a global scale in terms of atmospheric changes and loss of biological diversity. Second easily-implemented uniform control methods using feasible technologies or other direct regulatory approaches are already in place for many pollution and resource management problems in the United States. Additional progress with so-called command and control policies can be expensive and disruptive and thus counter productive to overall economic well being. This type of dilemma is common where environmental deterioration results from diffuse and complex causes inherent in technically-advanced high-consumption industrial societies such as the U.S. Solutions to these types of environmental problems are complicated by the diffuse benefits which obscures the net gains of additional controls that have concentrated and highly visible costs. Given this double bind many policy analysts and academics have for years advocated more cost-effective and flexible approaches relying on market forces to further some environmental management objectives. Although market-based theory and practical environmental policy are still far apart the incremental approach to environmental policymaking since the late seventies has resulted in some market-type innovations within traditional regulatory frameworks at all levels of government. The most prominent examples are the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) air emissions trading program and the recently enacted sulfur dioxide allowance trading program under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.,Private
Although seafood consumption can contribute to a healthy diet some fish and shellfish can cause foodborne illnesses or contain environmental contaminants.

In the early 1990s Sweden faced a banking and exchange rate crisis that led it to rescue banks that had experienced large losses on their balance sheets and that threatened a collapse of the banking system. Some analysts and others argue that Sweden's experience could provide useful lessons for the execution and implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 20081. The banking crisis facing the United States is unique so there are no exact parallels from which to draw templates. Sweden's experience however represents a case study in how a systemic banking crisis was resolved in a developed country with democratic institutions. The Swedish central bank separated out good assets which it left to the banks to oversee from bad assets which it placed in a separate agency with broad authority to work out debt problems or to liquidate assets. Four lessons that emerged form Sweden's experience are: 1) the process must be transparent; 2) the resolution agency must be politically and financially independent; 3) market discipline must be maintained; and 4) there must be a plan to jump-start credit flows in the financial system. provides an overview of the Swedish banking crisis and an explanation of the measures Sweden used to restore its banking system to health.,Private

On August 16 2004 President Bush unveiled one of the most sweeping changes to the numbers and locations of military overseas basing facilities since the beginning of the Cold War. Announcing a plan that had been under study for approximately three years the Department of Defense would move thousands of personnel from installations in Europe and Asia to bases within the United States. Simultaneously the military would shift its approach away from huge bases such as Ramstein Air Force Base which has all of the comforts of the U.S. - family housing supermarkets convenience stores theaters and so forth to reliance on more austere facilities in Central Asia Africa and the Middle East that would be less elaborate and lack most of these benefits. In 2004 the Congress chartered the Commission on the Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States (also known as the Overseas Basing Commission) to provide an independent assessment of the DOD overseas basing needs.1 The DOD plan could prompt budget and oversight decisions for the second session of the 109th Congress. These might include approval modification or rejection of the DOD proposal. Congress could also have to consider appropriations requests for construction of infrastructure at new overseas or expanded continental United States (CONUS) locations as well as fund increased impact aid to local communities. Congress would have to oversee new acquisition programs for mobility and logistics capabilities (such as airlift) needed for the strategy. Congress may also consider whether the plan will be executable given the results of the 2005 round of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. Finally the Senate may consider new or revised treaties with new basing partners submitted for its advice and consent.,Private
"Some U.S. producers of merchandise subject to antidumping (AD) duties or countervailing duties (CVD) complain that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have not collected the full amount of duties owed on targeted imports. One of the ""loopholes"" often cited is a law that allows importers that receive goods from new exporters of targeted merchandise to post bonds instead of cash deposits while an investigation of the ""new shipper"" is conducted to assess an appropriate AD or CVD duty amount based on the exporter's previous sales.

compares aggregate data on U.S. assistance to Iraq through FY2006 with U.S. assistance to Germany and Japan during the seven years following World War II. U.S. aid allocations (all grant assistance) for Iraq appropriated from 2003 through 2006 total $35.7 billion. About $11.8 billion (33%) went for economic infrastructure assistance. The remaining $23.8 billion was targeted at bolstering Iraqi security ($15.5 billion) and traditional political social and economic reform assistance ($8.3 billion). A higher proportion of Iraqi aid has been provided for economic reconstruction of critical infrastructure than was the case for Germany and Japan. Total U.S. assistance to Iraq thus far is about a fifth more than total assistance (adjusted for inflation) provided to Germany - and somewhat more than double that provided to Japan - from 1946-1952.,Private

"The ""War Powers Act of 1933"" is a name given by some members of the militia and patriot movement to emergency banking legislation passed in 1933 five days after President Roosevelt came into office. It has apparently been so labeled by some because the banking legislation amended the ""Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917"" in order to give legal underpinning to President Roosevelt's efforts to cope with the banking crisis. It is alleged by its modern-day critics that by that amendment the government in effect declared war on the American people and began a reign of unconstitutional rule through President emergency powers. These allegations overlook the facts that the amendment of the Trading with the Enemy Act has subsequently been repealed but the powers exercised pursuant to President Roosevelt's proclamation of national emergency have been terminated and that the President's exercise of emergency powers is now regulated under the ""National Emergencies Act.""",Private

International pressure on Iran to curb its nuclear program is increasing the hesitation of major foreign firms to invest in Iran's energy sector hindering Iran's efforts to expand oil production beyond 4.1 million barrels per day. Iran continues to attract preliminary energy investment interest from firms primarily in Asia. The formal U.S. effort to curb energy investment in Iran began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) although no firms have been sanctioned under it and the precise effects of that law on energy investment in Iran has been unclear.

States are now the primary regulator of insurers. Some insurers joined by some banks with insurance affiliates believe that current state insurance regulation hinders their effective competition with other financial intermediaries. Congress has several interests in any examination of state insurance regulation. In the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act it ceded that insurance regulatory authority to the states but it also committed to assessing the effectiveness of this regulation. Another is to assess the marketplace after the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which dramatically revised regulation for most of the financial services industry but left insurance regulation essentially unchanged. The objective of this report is to frame these issues in their historical and substantive contexts. The frame will have several parts. One is that insurance regulation developed at the state level largely because most companies were local. A second is that until 1945 the courts said that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to regulate insurance. Third since the 1950s Congress and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) have been engaged in a ongoing dialogue about the nature and quality of state regulation which has led both to the substantial growth of the NAIC and to increasing federal legislative involvement in insurance regulation. Fourth insurance is now regulated at both the state and national level.,Private

As the 111th Congress convenes economic stimulus activity through new spending and tax cuts will likely be of primary concern. Proposals that have been mentioned include the extension of bonus depreciation suspension of rules requiring withdrawals from individual retirement accounts an employee wage credit and the suspension of taxes on unemployment benefits. Measures to reduce the budget deficit-such as raising taxes on higher income individuals-may not be introduced in 2009. Instead it is possible that the reductions of the top tax rates created in 2001 would be allowed to expire at the start of 2011. Later in the 111th Congress after any economic stimulus measures are perceived to be taking effect other tax policy issues may be addressed. Policies that may be addressed include the alternative minimum tax changes in marginal individual income tax rates estate taxes corporate income tax rates and capital gains rates; and the taxation of small business.

Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a matter of concern for both Navy officials and Members of Congress who track Navy-related issues. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that executing a 30-year Navy shipbuilding plan submitted to Congress in early 2006 may require annual funding levels about 33% higher than the Navy plans and about 76% more than the Navy has received on average in recent years. Combined with constraints on shipprocurement funding rising ship procurement costs have caused the Navy in recent years to reduce planned ship procurement rates. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern about the effects these reduced rates would have on the future size of the Navy and on the shipyards that build the Navy's ships. The issue for Congress is how to respond to rising Navy ship procurement costs. Congress's decisions on this issue could affect future Navy capabilities Navy funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base.,Private

In 1998 a U.S. district court held that the imposition of the coal excise tax or black lung excise tax on exported coal was unconstitutional. Refunding the tax has been controversial. This is because some coal producers and exporters attempted to bypass the limitations in the Internal Revenue Code's refund scheme by bringing suit under the Export Clause in the Court of Federal Claims seeking damages from the United States in the amount of coal excise taxes paid. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held there was Tucker Act jurisdiction to hear some of the suits and allowed them as an alternative to the Code's refund process. However in a 2008 decision United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co. the Supreme Court held that taxpayers must comply with the Code's refund process. Meanwhile several bills would provide an alternative method for coal excise tax refunds including the amended version of H.R. 6049 (Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008) that was passed by the Senate on September 23 2008 and H.R. 7060 (Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act of 2008) which was passed by the House on September 26 2008.,Private

The 107th Congress enacted a variety of immigration-related laws. The Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296) reorganizes the federal government with the creation of a new Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security.

According to the President's budget request in FY2008 funds from a reauthorized MDUFMA would account for an estimated $47.5 million and 200 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). This would comprise 16.6% of FDA's medical device review budget authority and 13.0% of its medical device review-related FTEs. While these numbers and percentages are not as high as those projected for collection under a similar FDA user fee authority related to prescription drugs (pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act) they are significant.,Private
With the U.S. committed to implementing NAFTA most ongoing issues of interest to Congress once Public Citizen v. DOT is resolved are issues of oversight. The most immediate issues is oversight of implementation on the U.S. side of the border within the context of U.S. treaty obligations and the safety enforcement preconditions Congress set forth in the FY2002 DOT Appropriations Act. Mexican implementation may become a major oversight issue. The Mexican government as of this writing has neither accepted applications by U.S. firms to operate in Mexico nor set forth the regulations for doing so. Other oversight issues include whether the role of Mexican customs brokers and drayage operators in cross-border trade is a barrier against U.S. trucking firms; the possible illegal operation of Mexican trucks beyond their operating authority in the United States; and the leasing of Mexican trucks and drivers by U.S. firms for use in the United States.,Private

As the 110th Congress debates immigration control (i.e. border security and interior enforcement) and legal reform (i.e. temporary and permanent admissions) concerns arise over the capacity of the Department of Homeland Security to identify and remove temporary aliens who fail to depart when their visas expire. It is estimated that each year hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals overstay their nonimmigrant visas or enter the country illegally (with fraudulent documents or bypassing immigration inspections). The most recent published estimate based upon the March Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) is that 11.1 million unauthorized aliens were residing in the United States in 2005.2 Reliable estimates of the number of nonimmigrant overstays are not available and sample estimates range from 31% to 57% of the unauthorized population (depending on methodology).,Private

If housing prices were being driven by a bubble there is a chance that they could suddenly collapse with adverse effects on the U.S. economy. Residential investment which rose 9% annually in 2003-2005 fell by 9.8% in 2006:2. It remains to be seen if this decline is the beginning of a broader trend. A decline in housing wealth could also depress consumption thereby depressing aggregate spending in the short run. A sudden collapse in housing prices could also affect the health of the financial sector if financial institutions are not adequately safeguarded. All of these possibilities give Congress a cause for concern yet effective policy responses to a bubble are difficult. If house prices were to decline in some regions it would not be the first time this occurred. The report examines previous price declines in California New England and Texas.

The Navy's proposed FY2009 budget did not request funding for a 10th LPD-17 and instead proposed ending LPD-17 procurement with the ninth ship which was procured in FY2008. The Navy's planned 313-ship fleet calls for a 31-ship amphibious force that includes 10 LPD-17s and the Marine Corps states that a 33-ship amphibious force that includes 11 LPD-17s would be required to fully meet the Marine Corps' amphibious lift goal.,Private
Both the House and the Senate have passed comprehensive legislation to reauthorize existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) programs and expand the agency's authority to ensure the safety of prescription drugs medical devices and biologics. The Senate passed the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act (S. 1082) on May 9 2007. The House passed the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (H.R. 2900) on July 11 2007. At its core the legislation renews authority for two key user fee programs that are set to expire on October 1 2007: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA; P.L. 107-188) and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250). These account for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of FDA's total FY2008 program level budget. Without the reauthorizations and absent a substantial increase in FDA's annual appropriations the agency would lose a significant source of funding. FDA had warned that a failure to reauthorize the user fee programs before August 1 2007 would require the agency to issue layoff notices but the agency has reportedly forestalled that necessity by switching to reserve funds.,Private

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) enacted on August 8 2005 expanded some of the existing tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry and created several new ones.

The industry also benefits from provisions of current tax law that are not strictly tax subsidies (or tax expenditures) but that nevertheless provide advantages for and reduce effective tax rates of the oil and gas industry. The remainder of this report discusses these tax provisions in detail. The first section below discusses the origin and evolution of the oil and gas tax subsidies that were incorporated into the 2005 act. The second section summarizes each of the oil and gas tax subsidy provisions in the 2005 energy act and reports its corresponding revenue loss estimate. Section three describes other oil and gas tax subsidies those that existed before EPACT05 and were generally not affected by it. The final section describes several tax provisions that benefit the oil and gas industry; these are not tax subsidies per se - they are not considered to be tax expenditures - but are deemed by some observers to confer excessive (or unfair) benefits for the industry.,Private

Congress has several options for responding to recent proposals for procuring DOD ships and aircraft with funding mechanisms that do not conform to the full funding policy. These options could have the effect of terminating modifying maintaining or strengthening the full funding policy. In weighing these options Congress may consider several factors including Congress's power of the purse its ability to conduct oversight of DOD procurement programs the impact on future Congresses DOD budgeting discipline and the potential impact on weapon costs. The process of weighing options may involve balancing a need to meet DOD procurement goals within available funding against the goal of preserving Congress's control over DOD spending and its ability to conduct oversight of DOD programs.,Private

While the social security number (SSN) was first introduced as a device for keeping track of contributions to the Social Security system its use has been expanded by government entities and the private sector to keep track of many other government and private sector records. Use of the social security number as a federal government identifier was based on Executive Order 9393 issued by President Franklin Roosevelt. Beginning in the 1960s federal agencies started adopting the social security number as a governmental identifier and its use for keeping track of government records on both the federal and state levels greatly increased. Section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974 limits compulsory divulgence of the social security number by government entities. While the Privacy Act does provide some limits on the use of the social security number by state and federal entities exceptions provided in that statute and succeeding statutes have resulted in only minimal restrictions on governmental usage of the social security number. Constitutional challenges to social security number collection and dissemination have for the most part been unsuccessful. Private sector use of the social security number is widespread and continues to be largely unregulated by the federal government. The chronology in this report provides a list of federal developments affecting use of the social security number including federal regulation of the number as well as specific authorizations restrictions and fraud provisions concerning its use.,Private

During the nineteen-year occupation U.S. military and civilian officials numbering less than 2500 for the most part supervised the collection of taxes and the disbursement of revenues maintained public order and initiated a program of public works. The Haitian government remained in place but was subject to U.S. guidance. The Haitian people benefitted from the end of endemic political violence and from the construction of roads bridges and ports as well as from improved access to health care. The U.S. occupation was nonetheless deeply resented throughout Haitian society and many of its accomplishments did not long endure its termination in 1934.,Private

analyzes the factors that determine the cost of electricity from new power plants. These factors - including construction costs fuel expense environmental regulations and financing costs - can all be affected by government energy environmental and economic policies. Government decisions to influence or not influence these factors can largely determine the kind of power plants that are built in the future. For example government policies aimed at reducing the cost of constructing power plants could especially benefit nuclear plants which are costly to build. Policies that reduce the cost of fossil fuels could benefit natural gas plants which are inexpensive to build but rely on an expensive fuel. The report provides projections of the possible cost of power from new fossil nuclear and renewable plants built in 2015 illustrating how different assumptions such as for the availability of federal incentives change the cost rankings of the technologies.,Private

Throughout its history the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) which was once envisioned as a for-profit corporation has failed to achieve a profit and has needed to rely on annual federal subsidies for its survival. Despite this there has been enough support in Congress and at times also in the White House to provide just enough subsidies to keep Amtraks trains running. There has not however been enough federal and state financial support for Amtrak as a money losing (some would add at least at times mismanaged) operation to develop its routes into the robust national network that intercity passenger rail advocates had hoped for. That Amtrak has teetered on the edge of a shutdown many times only to be saved by federal subsidies raises the questions of why and to whom a national intercity rail network matters.,Private

"Federal law promises criminal defendants a proper venue i.e. trial in the district in which the federal crime was committed. A crime is committed in any district in which any of its ""conduct"" elements are committed. Some offenses are committed entirely within a single district; there they must be tried. Others begin in one district and are completed in another. They may be tried where they occur unless Congress has limited the choice of venue for the particular offense. Conspiracy may be tried in any district in which an overt act in its furtherance is committed at least when the commission of an overt act is an element of the conspiracy statute at issue. Crimes committed beyond the territorial confines of the United States are usually tried in the district into which the accused is first brought.

The federal government affects the supply and demand of various agricultural goods through farm income support and food donation programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides payments to farmers and landowners for producing certain program commodities. Ranking commodities by the level of support depends on the criteria and time period. Over FY2003-FY2005 USDA expects to spend about $11 billion annually on farm payments. In total outlays feed grains receive the most support (29% of the total) followed by wheat dairy and cotton (15%-18% each). However using different criteria based on the proportion of crop revenue from government payments rice peanuts and wool and mohair receive a higher percentage of revenue from the government (42%-51%) than cotton wheat and feed grains (12%-25%). USDA also purchases some of these program commodities and other non-program commodities and processed products for use in domestic and international food aid programs. In FY2003 USDA purchased commodities totaling $1.5 billion for domestic food assistance and $1.3 billion for international food aid. Beef was the most purchased commodity for domestic programs (15% of the total) followed by cheese (14%) and chicken (9%). The child nutrition and school lunch programs were significant users of these commodities. Wheat is the most-purchased commodity for international food aid programs (33%).,Private

In recent years numerous studies have addressed various concerns and provided recommendations regarding U.S. foreign aid policy funding and structure. Views range from general approval of the F process as a first step toward better coordination of aid programs and the need to build on it to strong criticism of the creation of the F Bureau its inadequacy in coordinating or reforming much of what is wrong with foreign aid and the need to replace it with a cabinet-level department of foreign aid. While the 14 studies surveyed by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) emphasize different aspects of the importance of U.S. foreign assistance all agree that foreign assistance must be reformed to improve its effectiveness. Of the 16 recommendation categories CRS identifies only enhancing civilian agency resources has the support of all of the studies covered in this report.

"At several meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin President George W. Bush stated that his administration will work with the Congress to grant Russia permanent ""normal trade relations"" (PNTR) status. The change in Russia's trade status will require legislation to lift the restrictions currently applied to Russia under Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 which includes the ""freedom-of-emigration"" requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. On November 19 2006 U.S. and Russian officials signed the bilateral agreement on Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Two basic methods are used by the Senate to bring legislation to the floor for consideration. The Senate at the majority leader's request grants unanimous consent to take up a matter or agrees to his motion to proceed to consider it. Because the motion to proceed is subject to debate in most circumstances it is not frequently used. Both methods are derived from the basic premise that the Senate as a body may decide what matters it considers. The Senate may also use the same two methods to bring up executive business (nominations and treaties).,Private

The Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative (BMENA) is a multilateral development and reform plan aimed at fostering economic and political liberalization in a wide geographic area of Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries. In December 2004 the first BMENA meeting took place in Rabat Morocco and was called the Forum for the Future. At the forum foreign ministers and finance ministers of the countries in the region stretching from Morocco to Pakistan as well as from the countries of the G8 pledged to create several new development programs and committed $60 million to a regional fund for business development. Critics of BMENA contend that the initiative focuses too heavily on economic issues instead of political reform and does little to strengthen non-governmental organizations and civil society groups in Arab and non- Arab Muslim countries.

Argentina's restructuring of over $100 billion in defaulted bond debt in June 2005 demonstrated the country's emergence from its 2001-2002 economic crisis that had caused severe stress on the political system. Current President Néstor Kirchner elected in 2003 has made bold policy moves in the areas of human rights institutional reform and economic policy that have helped restore Argentines' faith in democracy. The October 2005 legislative elections demonstrated strong support for President Kirchner whose popularity at this juncture bodes well for his re-election if he chooses to run in the October 2007 presidential election. Economic growth has rebounded since 2003 and in January 2006 Argentina paid off its $9.5 billion debt to the International Monetary Fund.

Throughout the last few decades the United States has had a strong interest in El Salvador. During the 1980s El Salvador was the largest recipient of U.S. aid in Latin America as its government struggled against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) insurgency during a 12-year civil war. A 1992 negotiated peace accord brought the war to an end and formally assimilated the FMLN into the political process as a political party. After the peace accords were signed U.S. involvement shifted towards helping the government rebuild democracy and implement market-friendly economic reforms. Successive National Republican Alliance (ARENA) governments including that of the current president Tony Saca have maintained close ties with the United States. The political scene in El Salvador has become increasingly focused on the January 2009 legislative elections and the March 2009 presidential election. U.S. observers are most interested in the upcoming presidential election particularly since the FMLN candidate Mauricio Funes appears to be leading the ARENA candidate Rodrigo �vila in the polls.,Private

South Korea followed a conciliation policy toward North Korea under the administrations of Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun; but President Lee Myung-bak elected in December 2007 states that he will link South Korean aid to North Korea more closely to the nuclear issue and will press North Korea on human rights.

"Islamic finance is based on principles of shariah or ""Islamic law."" Major principles of shariah are a ban on interest a ban on uncertainty adherence to risksharing and profit-sharing promotion of ethical investments that enhance society and asset-backing. The international market for Islamic finance has grown between 10% to 15% annually in recent years. Islamic finance historically has been concentrated in the Persian Gulf countries but has expanded globally to both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. There is a small but growing market for Islamic finance in the United States. Through international and domestic regulatory bodies there has been effort to standardize regulations in Islamic finance across different countries and financial institutions although challenges remain. Critics of Islamic finance express concerns about possible ties between Islamic finance and political agendas or terrorist financing and the use of Islamic finance to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions. Proponents argue that Islamic finance presents significant new business opportunities and provides alternate methods for capital formation and economic development.",Private
"S. 364 (Rockefeller) would amend the URAA to require that Congress expressly approve any regulatory modification or final rule proposed to implement an adverse WTO ruling and would rescind certain regulatory actions that have already entered into effect.

"In effect the Senate acts in a unicameral capacity when it is engaged in ""executive business""--so-called because the Senate and the chief executive are constitutionally involved in considering treaties and nominations.

Products liability refers to the liability of a manufacturer or seller for injury caused by his product to the person or property of a buyer or third party. Legal developments starting in the 1960s particularly the adoption of strict tort liability have made it substantially easier for persons injured by defective products to recover damages. Starting in the 1980s however many states enacted tort reform legislation that limited the rights of injured parties. Advocates for consumers and plaintiffs view strong products liability law as necessary to ensure adequate compensation for injured workers and consumers and to furnish an incentive for the manufacture of safe products. Manufacturers and their insurers by contrast contend that many products liability judgments are unwarranted or excessive and that national uniformity in products liability law is needed. Therefore they favor replacing the 50 state products liability laws with one federal law. In the 110th Congress the following bills have been introduced that would affect various aspects of products liability law: H.R. 961 H.R. 989 H.R. 1012 H.R. 2067 S. 243 S. 244 and S. 328.,Private

"A ""grand coalition"" government of Germany's two largest parties the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Socialist Union1 (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) led by CDU candidate Angela Merkel took office on November 22 2005 after the two parties worked out an agreement on a coalition governing program. The German federal election of September 18 2005 had produced no clear winner or direction for the next government. Some see this government as short-lived and unlikely to succeed while others believe that only such a coalition has the combined strength to implement potentially painful but needed economic and social benefits reforms assuming that it can overcome partisan politics. Foreign policy is likely to play a secondary and less contentious role given the press of domestic business and a general consensus on most international issues. The atmosphere of U.S.- German relations has already improved since the Merkel government took office as reflected by the successful first official visit of Chancellor Merkel to Washington on January 13 2006.",Private

A consistent theme of U.S. and other international criticism of Russia is that Russian troops use excessive and indiscriminate force to quell separatism in Chechnya and commit serious human rights abuses. Several analysts have discerned a decrease in Bush Administration criticism of Russian policy in Chechnya perhaps spurred to some degree by the Moscow theater hostage crisis and stepped-up terrorist bombings and armed attacks throughout Russia in 2003-2004. U.S. concerns before the Iraq conflict with gaining Russias support also may have contributed to the shifts. There appeared to be fewer Administration suggestions to Russia that it should open peace talks with former Chechnya leader Aslan Maskhadov more tolerance for Russias argument that it was battling terrorism in Chechnya and some hope that elections and rebuilding in Chechnya could contribute to a political settlement. But some in the Administration also argue that Russia is showing declining interest in the adoption of Western democratic and human rights values and that such slippage could ultimately harm bilateral relations.

U.S. relations with India depend largely on Indias political leadership. Indias 2004 national elections ended governance by the center-right coalition headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and brought in a new center-left coalition led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

The prospect of a GMD capability based in Europe raises a number of significant international security and foreign policy questions.

On May 6 2007 French voters chose the Gaullist Nicolas Sarkozy to be President of France. In a contentious campaign he defeated the Socialist S�gol�ne Royal by a margin of 53.1% to 46.9%. Sarkozy will assume power on May 16. The two-round legislative elections will follow on June 10 and 17. Sarkozy represents a younger generation of leaders at a time when a majority of the French public believes their country is in decline in part due to enduring low economic growth and high unemployment in part to an apparent diminishing influence in guiding the course of the European Union (EU). The second round of the presidential elections saw a near-record turnout of 84.9% in a campaign that was closely watched by voters. Sarkozy succeeded in capturing a majority of both the women's vote and the vote of those over 60.

Because of their importance to the U.S. economy and to many U.S. trade partners textile and apparel trade has been a major issue in trade relations with a number of countries and regions. Other industrialized countries have faced similar issues and international and domestic measures were undertaken to try to resolve conflicts between the interests of exporters and importers.

Over the past year increasing attention has focused on China's growing interest in Latin America. Most analysts appear to agree that China's primary interest in the region is to gain greater access to needed resources - such as oil copper and iron - through increased trade and investment. Some also believe Beijing's additional goal is to isolate Taiwan by luring the 12 Latin American and Caribbean nations still maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan to shift their diplomatic recognition to China. Some analysts maintain that China's involvement in the region could pose a future threat to U.S. influence. Others assert that China's inroads in Latin America are marginal and likely to remain overwhelmed by the economic and geographic advantage of the U.S. market. Although many Latin American countries welcome the new Chinese investment some view China as an economic threat and are concerned that both their domestic industries and their U.S. export markets will be overwhelmed by cheap Chinese imports.,Private

The bill also requires the President to report within 90 days and every year thereafter on the sale by Belarus of weapons or weapons-related assistance to regimes supporting terrorism and on the personal wealth of Lukashenko and other senior Belarusian leaders. The 109th Congress passed several resolutions criticizing human rights abuses and calling on Belarus to hold free and fair elections. In January 2007 President Bush signed the Belarus Democracy Reauthorization Act (P.L. 109-480) which reauthorized and updated the provisions of the 2004 law.,Private
SOFAs are often included along with other types of military agreements as part of a comprehensive security arrangement with a particular country. A SOFA itself does not constitute a security arrangement; rather it establishes the rights and privileges of U.S. personnel present in a country in support of the larger security arrangement. SOFAs may be entered based on authority found in previous treaties and congressional actions or as sole executive agreements. The United States is currently party to more than 100 agreements that may be considered SOFAs. A list of current agreements included at the end of this report is categorized in tables according to the underlying source of authority if any for each of the SOFAs.,Private
The pending debate over reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is likely to be a high priority in the 110th Congress. Funding authorizations for aviation programs set forth in Vision 100 - the Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L. 108-176 hereafter referred to as Vision 100) as well as authorization of the existing aviation tax structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund are set to expire at the end of FY2007.

The CAFTA-DR is not expected to have a large effect on the U.S. economy as a whole given the relatively small size of the Central American economies and the fact that most U.S. imports from the region had already been entering duty free under normal trade relations or CBI and GSP preferential arrangements. Adjustments will be slightly more difficult for some sectors but none are expected to be severe. Supporters see it as part of a policy foundation supportive of both improved intraregional trade as well as long-term social political and economic development in an area of strategic importance to the United States. Opponents wanted better trade adjustment and capacity building policies to address the potentially negative effects on certain importcompeting sectors and their workers. They also argued that the labor intellectual property rights and investment provisions in the CAFTA-DR needed strengthening. discusses negotiation issues and evolution of the CAFTA-DR agreement from the time negotiations commenced on January 27 2003 until its implementation by the last country on January 1 2009.,Private

The government of this long-term U.S. ally is trying to address endemic economic and social problems while adhering to stringent International Monetary Fund guidelines. Active Islamist groups capitalize on societal ills and create a troubling context for the government's efforts. They and others are victims of human rights abuses.

Members of Congress have become increasingly concerned about a perceived decline in U.S. manufacturing particularly as it may affect employment levels in their states or districts. For two years after the economy emerged from a relatively shallow recession in 2001 there was a continuing loss in manufacturing jobs. And even as the recovery progresses many fear that new non-manufacturing jobs will not have the same relatively high levels of wages and benefits traditionally associated with manufacturing. By contrast despite the recession of 2001 the level of real (inflation-adjusted) U.S. manufacturing output as of mid-2005 stood almost 30% higher than at a similar point after the recession of 1991 with about 2.5 million fewer manufacturing employees. This is more than three times real manufacturing output in 1960 when a comparable number of people were employed in manufacturing.,Private

The seven-year term of Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer was scheduled to expire on May 16 2007 and parliament (the Grand National Assembly) was required to elect a successor by that date. Since November 2002 the Justice and Development Party (AKP) a party with Islamist roots which claims a conservative democratic orientation controlled a comfortable majority in parliament but its numbers fell short of the two-thirds needed to elect a president in the first and second rounds of a vote. Sezer a former head of the Constitutional Court is an ardent secularist who often vetoed AKP-proposed laws and appointments that he found conflicted with the founding nationalist and secularist principles of the state. Both the AKP and its secularist opponents understood that much was at stake in the choice of Sezer's replacement. On April 25 2007 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan named Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to be the AKP's candidate for president. In doing so Erdogan appears to have severely misjudged his opposition failed to provide sufficient time for thoughtful discussion and contributed to one of the worst political crises in recent Turkish history.,Private

"On September 1 2008 Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda stunned observers by resigning his post saying that a new leader might be able to avoid the ""political vacuum"" that he faced in office. Fukuda's 11-month tenure was marked by low approval ratings a sputtering economy and virtual paralysis in policymaking as the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) used its control of the Upper House of Japan's parliament (the Diet) to delay or halt most government proposals. On September 22 the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will elect a new president who will become Japan's third prime minister in as many years. Ex-Foreign Minister Taro Aso a popular figure known for his conservative foreign policy credentials and support for increased deficit spending is widely expected to win. Many analysts expect that the new premier will dissolve the Lower House and call for parliamentary elections later in the fall. As a result Japanese policymaking is likely to enter a period of disarray which could negatively affect several items of interest to the United States including the passage of budgets to support the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan and the renewal of legislation that authorizes the deployment of Japanese navy vessels that are refueling ships supporting U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan. analyzes the factors behind and implications of Japan's current political turmoil.",Private
Vietnam's addition to the U.S. GSP program is generally viewed as another step in the process of promoting the continued growth of trade relations and expanding bilateral ties between the two countries.

Since 1991 the these three countries have made great strides in building democracies and free market economies.

Japan's FTA program assuming the current cautious and defensive course persists is likely to have varied effects on U.S. interests. On the one hand it is likely to provide a positive yet small boost to increasing Japan's role in the economics and political economy of East Asia. It is also likely to be favorable to bilateral trade ties as other Asian trading partners (instead of just the United States) pressure Japan to open its agricultural market further. On the other hand the absence of a meaningful agricultural reform bodes poorly for support from Japan in the agricultural negotiations of the Doha Round. There are also concerns that a defensive and weak FTA program could allow China to play a more dominant role in the Asian economy through its own FTA program - perhaps even creating a exclusionary Asian trading bloc.,Private

In 1979 official U.S. relations with Taiwan (the Republic of China) became a casualty of the American decision to recognize the communist government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as China's sole legitimate government. Since then U.S. unofficial relations with Taiwan have been built on the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act (P.L. 96-8) and shaped by three U.S.-China communiques.

"To effectively analyze the desired size and characteristics of tomorrow's military some argue that we must take a hard look at feasible real-world contingencies. A possible conflict with China attracts considerable attention from defense planners because it is a regional competitor today and could over time grow to be a ""near-peer"" competitor. Analysts can also easily identify flashpoints where the two nations might meet and feel compelled to defend national interests. The analysis in this report seeks to explore the possible role that U.S. nuclear and conventional forces might play in four stages of potential conflicts: deterrence prior to the start of the conflict; crisis stability in the early stages of the conflict; warfighting during the height of the conflict; and war termination through either a negotiated settlement or a battlefield victory. highlights a number of policy issues that may bear consideration in the ongoing debate regarding military investments.",Private

Since FY2001 Congress has conditioned U.S. aid to Serbia on a presidential certification that Serbia has met certain conditions including cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The second session of the 110th Congress may consider similar certification provisions in the FY2009 foreign aid legislation. Supporters of aid conditionality say such provisions may have spurred Serbia's cooperation with the Tribunal. Serbian cooperation with the ICTY may also be affected by the status of Serbia's Kosovo province. The Serbian government and parliament have threatened to sharply downgrade relations with any country that recognizes Kosovo's independence. If the United States and most European Union countries recognize Kosovo as they are expected to do in early 2008 Serbia cooperation with the ICTY might cease at least for a time.,Private

"A 1996 amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) enables American victims of international terrorist acts supported by certain States designated by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism - Cuba Iran North Korea Sudan Syria and previously Iraq and Libya - to bring suit in U.S. courts for damages. Despite congressional efforts to make blocked (or ""frozen"") assets of such States available for attachment by judgment creditors in such cases plaintiffs encountered difficulties in enforcing the awards. Congress passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 (NDAA) (H.R. 1585) an amendment to the FSIA to provide a federal cause of action against terrorist States and to facilitate enforcement of judgments. After the President vetoed the NDAA based on the possible impact the measure would have on Iraqi assets Congress passed a new version P.L. 110-181 (H.R. 4986) which includes authority for the President to waive the FSIA provision with respect to Iraq.

"Over the past several years reports indicate that an increasing number of U.S. firms have altered their structure by substituting a foreign parent corporation for a domestic one. Such ""inversions"" typically involve creation of a new foreign corporation in a country with low tax rates (a ""tax haven"") that becomes the parent of the firm's foreign and U.S. component corporations. A chief motive for inversions is apparently savings by firms on their U.S. corporate income tax. One source of savings is tax on a firm's foreign income: the United States taxes corporations chartered in the United States on both U.S. and foreign income but taxes foreignchartered corporations only on their U.S.-source income. An inversion can thus potentially reduce a firm's U.S. taxes on foreign income. Other tax savings apparently result from ""earnings stripping"" or the shifting of U.S.-source income from taxable U.S. components of the firm to the tax-exempt foreign parts.",Private

In recent years Congress has been increasingly concerned that other countries - China Japan Taiwan and Korea in particular - are manipulating the value of their national currencies in ways injurious to the U.S. economy. A spate of legislation was introduced in the 109th Congress seeking to pressure foreign countries to revalue their currencies or seeking changes in the international financial system - particularly changes in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - that would help accomplish that end. Similar bills are likely to be introduced in the 110th Congress.,Private
"In the week before Congress adjourned for recess on September 30 the House and Senate passed conference agreements on both the FY2007 national defense authorization bill H.R. 5122 and the FY2007 defense appropriations bill H.R. 5631. The President signed the appropriations bill into law P.L. 109-289 on September 29 and he signed the authorization bill into law P.L. 109-364 on October 17. The conference agreement on the appropriations bill provides $436.6 billion for defense including $366.6 billion in regular appropriations and $70 billion in additional appropriations mainly as a ""bridge fund"" for operations abroad. The total of regular appropriations is $4 billion below the Administration request. The Senatepassed bill provided $9 billion less than the request which freed that much to add to non-defense appropriations bills. The White House  however threatened to veto the defense bill if reduced defense by more than $4 billion.",Private
This is a comparison of the laws of the United Kingdom and of the United States that govern criminal and intelligence investigations of terrorist activities. Both systems rely upon a series of statutory authorizations: in the case of the United States primarily the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act; in the case of the United Kingdom the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act the Police Act the Intelligence Services Act. Among other differences the U.S. procedures rely more heavily upon judicial involvement and supervision while those of the UK employ other safeguards. The UK procedures afford greater latitude to arrest detain and supervise suspected terrorists than those available in the United States.,Private
The overview that this report provides is useful background information for a number of policy issues that have received congressional consideration. Analysis of these policy issues is beyond the scope of this report. Some of these issues are the political status of the territories and their relationship with the United States; whether the possessions are taxed unfairly or more favorably than the states taking into account their limited participation in federal spending programs; and whether the possessions that use the mirror system of taxation have sufficient fiscal flexibility given the difference between their economies and that of the United States.,Private

The policy issues for Congress surrounding the monitoring and enforcement of international trade agreements focus on three basic problems. The first is whether sufficient resources and the governmental organization exist to accomplish the task. The second and related issue is whether new data and information should be generated to determine whether trade agreements are being fully implemented. A third issue is the effectiveness of various monitoring and enforcement approaches and whether the WTO dispute settlement mechanism is effectively resolving complaints.,Private
The House has chosen to handle committee jurisdiction in a number of ways. It has chosen to concentrate jurisdiction over an issue in new existing and temporary committees. It has chosen to keep jurisdiction over components of an issue distributed among several committees. And it has chosen to vest in one committee jurisdiction over a narrow subject matter that could just as readily have been considered a component of subject matter within another committees jurisdiction. Rules relating to referral and the Speakers referral authority have also been changed to deal with jurisdictional issues.

The role for Congress in this financial crisis is multifaceted. A major issue is how to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of financial markets to promote the general well-being of the country while protecting taxpayer interests and facilitating business operations without creating a moral hazard. In addition to preventing future crises through legislative oversight and domestic regulatory functions Congress has been providing funds and ground rules for economic stabilization packages and informing the public through hearings and other means. The largest question may be how U.S. regulations should be changed if necessary and how closely any changes are harmonized with international recommendations. Other questions include: should the United States promote global regulatory standards to be voluntarily adopted by countries or should a supranational regulatory institution be created that would impose rules on international financial markets? Where would enforcement authority reside; at the state national or international level? Congress also plays a role in measures to reform international financial institutions and in recapitalizing the International Monetary Fund. Also should U.S. policies be designed to restore confidence in and induce return to the normal functioning of a self-correcting financial system or has the system itself become inherently unstable?,Private

On December 7 1998 the federal banking regulators invited comments on proposed regulations that would require banks and thrifts to develop formal policies and procedures whereby they could identify unusual transactions in customers' accounts to report as suspicious activity in conjunction with the federal laws outlawing money laundering. Small banks criticized the increased costs of screening. Individuals and businesses raised privacy concerns. Although there were varied proposals before the 106th Congress on the issue no legislation was enacted. The issue likeliest to command attention in the 107th Congress is international money laundering. There have been recent instances in which banking regulators imposed corrective action comparable to the Know Your Customer requirements on the several international banking institutions after unearthing potential money laundering activity.,Private

National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) are often of considerable interest to many Members of Congress. They represent the most formal assessment of a given issue by the U.S. Intelligence Community and address issues of major national security importance which may require congressional action. The intelligence process however is not an exact science and on occasion NIEs have proved unreliable because they were based on insufficient evidence or contained faulty analysis. This was demonstrated in the NIE produced in 2002 on Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction parts of which were significantly inaccurate. NIEs can provide insights into the likely effects of certain policy approaches but they are not usually made to take into account the details of planned U.S. diplomatic economic military or legislative initiatives.,Private
"China's rapid economic growth since 1979 has transformed it into a major economic power. Over the past few years many analysts have contended that China could soon overtake the United States to become the world's largest economy based on estimates of China's economy on a ""purchasing power parity"" (PPP) basis which attempts to factor in price differences across countries when estimating the size of a foreign economy in U.S. dollars. However in December 2007 the World Bank issued a study that lowered its previous 2005 PPP estimate of the size of China's economy by 40%. If these new estimates are accurate it will likely be many years before China's economy reaches U.S. levels. The new PPP data could also have an impact on U.S. and international perceptions over other aspects of China's economy including its living standards poverty levels and government expenditures such as on the military.",Private

Putin's genuine popularity at home combined with the near-total control that he and his regime exercise over nearly every aspect of the political scene guaranteed the electoral outcomes sought by the Kremlin. Major questions remain however about the configuration of political power after Medvedev succeeds Putin as president. What will be the balance of power between the President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin? Will a diarchy of power be stable? Will Putin seek to regain the presidency after a Medvedev interregnum which would legalize a third (and fourth) non-consecutive term for Putin? The answers to these questions will help determine the course of Russia's political evolution  continuing and consolidating the authoritarianism that Putin has fostered or moderating that trend. At the same time Russia's domestic political evolution will likely have a strong influence on its relations with its neighbors with the EU and NATO and with the United States.,Private

The Gaza crisis constitutes a conundrum for all involved. Israel would like to avoid a drawn-out invasion and occupation of Gaza but at the same time does not want to abandon the military operation without assurance that the end result will leave Israelis more secure from rocket attacks. Although the ground attack might endanger its rule in Gaza Hamas may welcome it in the hopes of miring Israeli forces in close-quarters combat to strip away their advantages in technology and firepower and in hopes of heightening perceptions that Palestinians are being victimized. Linking the cessation of violence in and around Gaza with international enforcement of a truce or a broader regional security initiative may be possible but at present no proposed solution appears straightforward.,Private

"The Bush Administration has made bilateral and regional free-trade agreements (FTAs) an important element of U.S. trade policy a strategy known as ""competitive liberalization."" This strategy it argues will push forward trade liberalization simultaneously on bilateral regional and multilateral fronts. It is meant to spur trade negotiations by liberalizing trade with countries willing to join FTAs and to pressure other countries to negotiate multilaterally. Critics contend however that the accent on regional and bilateral negotiations undermines the multilateral forum and increases the risk of trade diversion away from competitive countries not in the trade bloc.

"The first East Asia Summit (EAS) met on December 14 2005 in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. It brought together the ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) [Brunei Burma Cambodia Indonesia Laos Malaysia Philippines Singapore Thailand and Vietnam] as well as the ""plus three"" states [China South Korea and Japan] and Australia New Zealand and India to discuss issues of common concern. Japanese officials have described the EAS as an ""historic summit meeting to be held with a view to establishing a future East Asia Community."" Such a group could potentially replace Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) as the main multilateral forum in Asia on trade and investment liberalization and economic integration. Russia was invited to attend the EAS as a special guest. Some in the United States are concerned that the East Asia Summit marks a rise in Asian regionalism in which the United States is not playing a leading role. There is also concern that China may use the East Asia Summit to consolidate a leading role in Asia. A key outcome of the first East Asia Summit is that ASEAN appears to have retained a central role in the process.",Private

This reports explains the origin growth and persistence of committee controls over executive agency decisions in the face of repeated legal and constitutional objections by various Administrations. By reviewing the origin of committee controls six to seven decades ago one is better able to understand how and why these committee-agency relationships were forged and why some committee-veto provisions have survived after the Supreme Court in INS v. Chadha (1983) declared the legislative veto unconstitutional. What is interesting about the continuation of committee review procedures after Chadha is that they appear not merely in statutory provisions (objected to regularly by Presidents in their signing statements) but in agency budget manuals as well. That is despite constitutional objections raised by Presidents and the Justice Department executive departments and agencies have found it both practicable and necessary to submit certain proposals to designated committees for their review and approval.,Private

The Kurdish-inhabited region of northern Iraq has been relatively peaceful and prosperous since the fall of Saddam Hussein. However the Iraqi Kurds' political autonomy demands and ambitions are causing friction with Christian and other minorities in the north with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other Arab leaders of Iraq and with neighboring Turkey and Iran. These tensions threaten to undermine the stability achieved throughout Iraq in 2008 although U.S. political influence over the Kurds is likely to prevent a near term de-stabilizing escalation of the disputes. The U.S. ability to keep these tensions contained could wane as U.S. forces as planned draw down from Iraq over the next three years.,Private
Japan has expressed interest in purchasing the F-22A Raptor aircraft from the United States.

Other Than Mexicans (OTMs) apprehended along the Southwest border by the USBP between official POE cannot be returned to Mexico because Mexico will not accept them. Instead they must be returned to their countries of origin or third countries that will accept them by the Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). However DRO does not have enough detention beds to accommodate every OTM that is apprehended. As a result of this the majority of OTMs apprehended by the USBP in FY2005 were released into the interior of the United States with notices to appear before an immigration judge. Most of these released OTMs fail to show up for their hearings and are not ultimately removed. In order to address the increasing number of OTMs being apprehended and circumvent the regular removal process the USBP is currently expanding its Expedited Removal (ER) program across the entire southwest border. Issues for Congress include the potential for terrorist infiltration the current lack of detention bed-space that has led to OTMs being released into the interior of the country whether the expansion of the ER program will succeed with the current levels of detention bedspace and how best to deploy DHS resources to address the growing number of OTMs entering into the country illegally.,Private

Legislation passed late in the 103rd Congress granted the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) authority to design and implement more rigorous rules regulating the au pair program. In 1997 the au pair program received considerable media attention as a result of the Louise Woodward court case regarding possible involvement of an au pair in the death of a child in Massachusetts. The U.S. Information Agency amended existing federal regulations for the au pair program in September 1997 to underscore the cultural exchange aspect of the program and strengthen au pair recruiting and training.,Private
The new Palestinian unity government established in March 2007 complicates U.S. policy toward the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the peace process. When Hamas took power last year the Bush Administration along with its Quartet partners and Israel responded by cutting off contact with and halting assistance to the PA. The Administration sought to isolate and remove Hamas while supporting moderates in Fatah led by President Mahmud Abbas. The international sanctions have not driven Hamas from power and instead some assert they may have provided an opening for Iran to increase its influence among Palestinians by filling the void. Now that Hamas and Fatah are sharing power it will be harder to isolate Hamas. The United States and European countries have held meetings with non-Hamas members of the new government while Israel continues to rule out all contact with PA ministers. Arab states led by Saudi Arabia are pressing for recognition of the new government and an end to the international boycott. Some observers believe Saudi efforts to gain acceptance of the unity government and restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks may be an effort to set the price for Saudi cooperation on other U.S. policies in the region. In 2006 Congress passed P.L. 109-446 the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 to tighten existing restrictions on aid to the Palestinians. In 2007 Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced H.R. 1856 which would amend the original Act to further restrict contact with and assistance to the PA.,Private
China is a major source of U.S. imports of consumer products (such as toys) and an increasingly important supplier of various food products.

There is a large and growing difference between the official trade statistics released by the United States and the People's Republic of China. According to the United States the 2007 bilateral trade deficit with China was $256.3 billion. According to China its trade surplus with the United States was $162.9 billion - $93.4 billion less. This paper examines the differences in the trade data from the two nations in two ways. First it compares the trade figures at the two digit level using the Harmonized System to discern any patterns in the discrepancies between the U.S. and Chinese data. This comparison reveals that over two-thirds of the difference in the value of China's exports to the United States is attributable to five types of goods. The second approach to examining the differing trade data involves a review of the existing literature on the technical and non-technical sources of the trade data discrepancies.,Private
There is concern that President Alberto Fujimori not only manipulated the system to allow himself to run for a third term but also inhibited freedom of speech and of the press. Critics charge that he controlled judicial and electoral institutions in such a way as to impede the development of a free and fair electoral process and limited the rights of all citizens to participate in the electoral process either as candidates or voters. Options for Congress range from a cautious approach aimed at protecting security interests to applying greater pressure on the government of Peru to respect and develop democratic processes.,Private
In a low voter turnout in legislative elections on December 11 2004 the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT) increased its legislative majority against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). This means that DPP President Chen Shui-bian who was reelected to a second term on March 20 2004 again will not be able to count on legislative support for his policies in his second and final term. In both the presidential and legislative election campaigns Chen emphasized gaining a separate international identity for Taiwan an emphasis to which Beijing strenuously objected as dangerously close to declaring Taiwan independence from China. While Chens strategy appeared to gain the DPP electoral momentum in March it may have had the opposite electoral effect in December. In response to his partys defeat at the polls Chen resigned as DPP party chair on December 15 2004. He is expected to have to moderate his policies and move closer to the political center for the rest of his term in order to regain public support and in an effort to ensure legislative support for his economic and other policy initiatives. Any move to dial down pro-independence rhetoric could ease tensions with Beijing and the concerns of U.S. policymakers.,Private

"Exercising one or another of these ""rights to die"" may have drastically different legal consequences: some currently have no legal consequence some are a violation of common-law some are a violation of statute some may have contractual consequences some may result in an action such as civil confinement some are currently protected by legislation and some may be protected by the United States Constitution. examines the legal status of the five distinct issues: 1) suicide 2) passive euthanasia 3) assisted suicide 4) active euthanasia and 5) palliative care. The report examines the history of how each of these issues has been treated and evaluates the constitutional right of a person to pursue these courses of action. It addresses state law regarding living wills advance medical directives and how these types of decisions are made regarding persons who have left neither. The report addresses congressional powers and existing federal statutes that are implicated in these issues such as the Patient Self-Determination Act the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act and the Controlled Substances Act. It then addresses bills introduced in the 109th Congress S. 539 and H.R. 1151 both entitled the ""Incapacitated Persons Legal Protection Act of 2005;"" a bill passed by the House H.R. 1332 ""The Protection of Incapacitated Persons Act of 2005;"" a bill passed by the Senate ""For the Relief of the Parents of Theresa Marie Schiavo;"" and a similar bill passed by the House and Senate S. 686. This last bill was signed by the President and became P.L. 109-3. The report notes that current state regulations prohibiting assisted suicide have been upheld by the Supreme Court and that similar prohibitions against active euthanasia are likely to be upheld against constitutional challenge. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment however appears to limit a state's ability to regulate passive euthanasia (termination of medical treatment). Finally palliative care may ultimately be found to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment but the possible abuse of such care may raise policy concerns.",Private

In the 109th Congress several bills have been introduced concerning breastfeeding. At this time all of the bills are in committee. H.R. 2122 the proposed Pregnancy Discrimination Act Amendments of 2005 was introduced on May 5 2005.

The United States welcomed the successful October conclusion of 2002 elections in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir where nearly half of the electorate cast ballots. The elections resulted in the ousting of the long-dominant National Conference party allies of the national coalition-leading Bharatiya Janata Party thus bolstering the credibility of the process and dampening criticism from some quarters that the elections were flawed or farcical. The opposition Indian National Congress and the regional People's Democratic Party won a combined 36 seats in the state assembly and Congress leader Sonia Gandhi agreed to a first-ever power-sharing coalition.,Private
Former President Alan Garcia continued his political comeback by being elected President on June 4 2006 defeating populist Ollanta Humala. Not only the winning candidate will have an impact on U.S. relations with Peru: lacking a majority in the newly-elected Congress Garcia will have to negotiate with the other parties to pass his program.

It examines the reach of the executive order and provides legal analyses of some of the constitutional questions raised in the courts by similar sanctions programs noting that the broad language of the executive order is not unprecedented. In view of the fact that there is an expectation that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) will publish names of persons designated under the executive order and issue regulations further refining its terms and applicability the report examines some of the procedures available to challenge OFAC sanction regulations and briefly discusses OFAC's rules which may be of concern to attorneys representing individuals and entities subjected to sanctions or involved in transactions with sanctioned persons.,Private
Federal court denial of British extradition requests in the cases of four fugitives from Northern Ireland led to the Supplementary Extradition Treaty. The Treaty proved controversial and before the Senate would give its consent it insisted upon modifications some quite unusual. Those modifications have been eliminated in a newly negotiated treaty to which the Senate has recently given its advice and consent and which incorporates features often more characteristic of contemporary extradition treaties with other countries. The Senate conditioned its approval of the Treaty upon an understanding two declarations and three provisos which relate to the Treaty's treatment of the exception for politically motivated requests and the role of the courts its changes in the double jeopardy clause assurances that the Treaty is not designed to accomplish the extradition of fugitives from Northern Ireland covered by the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and reporting requirements concerning the disposition of requests under the Treaty.,Private
"Prior to 2004 the Extraterritorial Income (ETI) provisions of the U.S. tax code provided a tax benefit for exporters. ETI like the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) provisions they replaced was designed to boost U.S. exports. The European Union (EU) however filed complaints with the World Trade Organization (WTO) charging that ETI and FSC were export subsidies and so violated the WTO agreements. In a succession of rulings the WTO upheld the EU's charges and authorized the EU to levy retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. The EU began a phased-in application of tariffs in March 2004. Several policy options for the United States were proposed in Congress including retaining ETI and accepting whatever tariffs would be imposed; overhauling the U.S. method of taxing foreign-source income by adopting a ""territorial"" tax system; reforming the U.S. tax system in general by adopting a consumption tax similar to the value-added taxes levied by European countries; attempting negotiations with the EU; and repealing the ETI provisions while replacing them with tax cuts elsewhere. The last of these approaches was ultimately taken by Congress in October 2004 with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA; P.L. 108-357). Although the EU lifted its tariffs in January 2005 it also lodged a WTO complaint against transition provisions in AJCA which had the effect of rescinding the ETI only gradually in certain cases. In May 2006 a provision of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act (P.L. 109-222) repealed the transition rules apparently bringing an end to the longsimmering controversy.",Private

Member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) contribute to the activities of the alliance in several ways the chief of which is through the deployment of their own armed forces funded by their national budgets. Certain commonly conducted activities however are paid for out of three NATO-run budgets. These three accounts - the civil budget the military budget and the security investment program - are funded by individual contributions from the member states. The countries' percentage shares of the common funds are negotiated among the members and are based upon per capita GDP and several other factors. The aggregate U.S. share which has fallen over the past three decades was 25.8% in 2005. Ten central and eastern European nations were admitted into the alliance in 1999 and 2004 and several other countries would also like to join. As NATO expands it has incurred certain additional costs to accommodate the new members. These costs are being shared by all including the new countries. In 2005 members of the alliance adopted new burdensharing arrangements; the U.S. level however was limited to its current share. Additional changes in the cost share formulas are under review. The second session of the 110th Congress will likely review U.S. contributions to the NATO budgets in the context of the Defense and State Departments' appropriations.,Private

Russia announced on August 29 2008 that it was banning poultry imports from 19 U.S. establishments due to safety concerns and that 29 others could lose approval if they do not improve their standards. Russian officials also signaled that they might reduce U.S. permits to import poultry and pork under that country's quota system. The economic stakes of Russian import actions are high for U.S. poultry producers - 29% of their exports went to that market in 2007 - and red meat producers who also are experiencing strong growth in the Russian market. In Congress any potential options likely would be reviewed within the context of the broader geopolitical situation.,Private

Reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other aviation programs is likely to be a high priority in the 110th Congress as funding authorizations for aviation programs and the aviation tax structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund will expire at the end of FY2007.

One particularly controversial option under consideration is a more direct user fee system which is supported by the airlines but strongly opposed by many other system users. Congress may also examine airport financing mechanisms including airport improvement program (AIP) grants passenger facility charges (PFCs) bonds and other revenue sources.,Private

"As Congress weighs comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would likely include additional border and interior enforcement a significant expansion of guest workers and perhaps include increased levels of permanent immigration some question whether the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can handle the increased immigration workload. There are concerns that the immigration responsibilities in the DHS are not functioning effectively. DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff announced a ""Second Stage Review"" (2SR) in 2005 that includes strengthening border security and interior enforcement and reforming immigration processes as major agenda items.

"The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution provides that the Congress shall have the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. The plain meaning of this language might indicate a limited power to regulate commercial trade between persons in one state and persons outside of that state. However the Commerce Clause has never been construed quite so narrowly. Rather the clause along with the economy of the United States has grown and become more complex. In addition when Congress began to address national social problems the Commerce Clause was often cited as the constitutional basis for such legislation. As a result the Commerce Clause has become the constitutional basis for a significant portion of the laws passed by the Congress over the last fifty years and it currently represents one of the broadest bases for the exercise of congressional powers. An examination of the United States Code shows that over 700 statutory provisions covering a range of issues explicitly refer to either ""interstate"" or ""foreign"" commerce. Over the last decade however the Supreme Court in United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison has brought into question the breadth of the Commerce Clause. While these cases have resulted in the overturning of a few federal laws their overall effect has so far been relatively modest in scope. A case currently before the Supreme Court however Ashcroft v. Raich could portend a more significant effect on current federal law.",Private

"Regional cooperation in halting continued overuse of scarce water resources has been a casualty of the long-running Arab-Israeli conflict. The Dead Sea has been a victim of this neglect and scientists estimate that it will decrease substantially in the coming decades due to overexploitation of the Jordan River. One possible solution is to construct a canal from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea to pump sea water into the salt lake while generating hydroelectric power for use in desalination. The governments of Israel and Jordan have been enthusiastic proponents of the ""Peace Canal"" and are calling on the international community including the United States to support its multi-billion dollar construction. However opponents of the canal claim that it may do more environmental harm than good and suggest that the Dead Sea be naturally restored by allowing the Jordan River to flow southward unimpeded.

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President I come to the floor to correct the ,Public
record concerning statements the Senate majority leader made yesterday ,Public
in which he claimed that GEN John Abizaid's nomination to be Ambassador ,Public
  Allow me to ease the majority leader's concerns. Far from being ,Public
``held up'' the Foreign Relations Committee with my full support has ,Public
been extremely diligent in taking up General Abizaid's nomination; he ,Public
appeared on the very first committee nominations hearing of the 116th ,Public
Congress and his nomination is advancing through the regular committee ,Public
process expeditiously. I look forward to his approval by the committee ,Public
and hopefully a speedy confirmation. As with all nominees his final ,Public
confirmation is under the control of the majority leader.,Public
  I am concerned that the majority leader has an inaccurate view of the ,Public
nominations situation facing the Foreign Relations Committee. He stated ,Public
yesterday that ``if we want to solve problems in the Middle East ,Public
through diplomacy we'll need to confirm diplomats.'' Unfortunately we ,Public
  It took 23 months before the Trump administration bothered to ,Public
nominate General Abizaid leaving a gaping hole in our diplomatic ,Public
posture to Saudi Arabia and the region. It is possible that this ,Public
failure of leadership is the result of the President believing that his ,Public
son-in-law Jared Kushner is capable of doing this job from the White ,Public
  Regardless of the reason Saudi Arabia is not an isolated example. It ,Public
took even longer over 2 years before the Trump administration ,Public
nominated a candidate to be U.S. Ambassador to Turkey. We are now 26 ,Public
months into the Trump administration and we still lack ambassadorial ,Public
nominees to critical countries like Egypt Pakistan and our close ,Public
ally Jordan. This failure is a reckless abdication of a constitutional ,Public
responsibility that is essential to projecting American power abroad. ,Public
There is only one person responsible for this failure: President Trump; ,Public
yet the majority leader appears to be curiously oblivious to that fact.,Public
  Let me be clear: When the committee has received nominations we have ,Public
worked with efficiency and diligence to vet and advance those ,Public
nominations. I have devoted my time and staff resources to ensure this ,Public
because of my strong belief that the State Department USAID and other ,Public
foreign affairs agencies must be appropriately staffed. We cannot ,Public
promote our foreign policy protect American citizens and advocate for ,Public
American businesses without a robust diplomatic corps. In the 115th ,Public
Congress the committee reported 169 nominations. I reject any ,Public
assertion that we have not done our part to ensure that the State ,Public
  All too often however the committee has received nominations late ,Public
  There is unfortunately there is another severe problem that we ,Public
cannot ignore with regard to this administration's nominees. Delays in ,Public
advancing Trump political nominees is largely due to poor vetting by ,Public
this administration. When the President nominates and renominates ,Public
individuals with restraining orders for threats of violence who ,Public
engaged in incidents that should frankly mean they never should have ,Public
been nominated or made material omissions sometimes on a repeated ,Public
basis in their nomination materials the Foreign Relations Committee ,Public
must do our due diligence on behalf of the American people. Someone has ,Public
to. My staff and I have had to spend significant additional time on ,Public
vetting because of the White House's negligence or incompetence.,Public
  The United States and our allies continue to face tremendous ,Public
challenges around the world. We must continue to lead on the ,Public
international stage and work in collaboration with international ,Public
partners to achieve our shared security goals but to have our ,Public
diplomats in place they must be nominated in a timely fashion and ,Public
vetted properly. Despite the majority leader's confusion on this issue ,Public

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from ,Public
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker we spent many hours in this Chamber talking ,Public
about the amendments to the appropriations bill this combination of ,Public
several appropriations bills that we will pass later this week.,Public
  What I would like to take a minute to talk about is an amendment I ,Public
didn't offer because we got the material in the base text.,Public
  Our Constitution creates a tension between Article I and Article II ,Public
when it comes to the power to wage war: the Commander in Chief on the ,Public
one hand versus the authority of Congress to declare war on the other.,Public
  Thomas Jefferson determined that it was necessary to get the approval ,Public
of Congress before he deployed Marines to the shores of Tripoli our ,Public
first non-declared war our first intervention in the Middle East and ,Public
a precedent that should have been followed by subsequent Presidents.,Public
  But in fact since the days of Jefferson on many occasions ,Public
Presidents just sent our troops in without seeking authority from ,Public
Congress. That is why in 1973 in the wake of the Vietnam war this ,Public
Congress passed the War Powers Act also known as the War Powers ,Public
Resolution. It provides that the President cannot deploy for more than ,Public
60 or 90 days without an authorization to use military force.,Public
  Now that act of 1973 is not everything it should be because it did ,Public
not encompass the idea of bombing without deploying troops for periods ,Public
of 60 or 90 days. It is unclear perhaps. It is in need of revision ,Public
perhaps but it is the only legal restraint on a President committing ,Public
us to war without any approval from this Congress.,Public
  But every Attorney General since the 1970s has advised Presidents ,Public
that the War Powers Act isn't actually binding on them that a ,Public
President can send unlimited troops into battle for an unlimited period ,Public
for any purpose. This is not what should be and yet many ,Public
constitutional scholars agree with these provisions with this ,Public
why the provision that we have in this appropriations bill is so ,Public
  I want to commend the subcommittee and the full committee for ,Public
including in the base text the provision that says no funds shall be ,Public
used in contravention of the War Powers Act. This is a provision I ,Public
originally proposed as an amendment on this floor in 2011. We lost the ,Public
first time but we ultimately prevailed and now it is part of the base ,Public
text. This adds the power of the purse to enforce the War Powers Act.,Public
  I am pleased to report that Attorney General Mukasey a Rean ,Public
Attorney General a strong advocate for Presidential power testified ,Public
before the Foreign Affairs Committee that he believes and would advise ,Public
the President that they need not follow the War Powers Act but that ,Public
they dare not spend a penny in contravention of the War Powers Act if ,Public
this provision is included in the relevant appropriations bill. So I ,Public
commend the committee for including this and assuring that any ,Public
reasonable Attorney General will tell any President they must adhere to ,Public
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker in the remaining few seconds let me deal ,Public
with another subject. Mark Zuckerberg has announced that he's going to ,Public
  The effect would be to undermine our economy by reducing the ,Public
importance of the U.S. dollar in international transactions and to ,Public
undermine our national security by making it easier for drug dealers ,Public
terrorists and sanctions evaders to do businesses without using the ,Public
  I look forward to addressing this House further and to working in the ,Public
Financial Services Committee. But it certainly concerns me that a man ,Public
who has benefited like no other from the protection of the U.S. ,Public
national security efforts and from the U.S. economy would undermine ,Public
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov],Public
  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President on another matter today the Senate ,Public
will consider a War Powers Resolution offered by the junior Senator ,Public
from Virginia. Our colleague's resolution is deeply flawed on a number ,Public
  As I explained yesterday it is too blunt and too broad. It is also ,Public
an abuse of the War Powers Act which was designed to strike a balance ,Public
between the President's constitutional war powers and Congress's own ,Public
  Some of us believe the War Powers Act went too far in undermining the ,Public
separation of powers and infringing upon the authorities of the ,Public
Commander in Chief. But apart from that debate everyone should ,Public
acknowledge that it was designed to stop Vietnams--the deployment of ,Public
thousands of troops into sustained combat without congressional ,Public
uses of limited force that Presidents have carried out literally for ,Public
  Until recently most in this body recognized the need for Presidents ,Public
to have flexibility with respect to the threat of military force. They ,Public
saw the deterrent effect and diplomatic utility of keeping our options ,Public
  During President Obama's tenure Democrats said frequently that when ,Public
it comes to Iran we should never take the military option off the ,Public
table. But now they seek to use this privileged resolution to do ,Public
  The collateral institutional damage of this action would fall on our ,Public
military. Its ability to operate quickly and adaptively to emerging ,Public
  Colleagues if you want to take the truly significant step of ,Public
preemptively taking options off the table for defending our troops if ,Public
you really want to remove troops from Syria or Iraq altogether why ,Public
don't you just be honest about it and make your case? Find 60 votes to ,Public
pass legislation. Find 67 votes to override a Presidential veto. Don't ,Public
use a blunt and imprecise War Powers Resolution to end-run around the ,Public
constitutional structures that make this a difficult proposition by ,Public
  There is no ongoing protracted combat with respect to Iran. Our ,Public
troops are not mired in unending hostilities. The War Powers Act aims ,Public
to impose a 60-day clock on combat operations. The strike that killed ,Public
Soleimani took maybe 60 seconds. Let me say that again. The strike took ,Public
  We have just come through an impeachment trial because House ,Public
Democrats rushed to use this serious tool as a political weapon of ,Public
first resort rather than patiently conducting more normal oversight ,Public
using the more normal tools that Congresses of both parties typically ,Public
use. No patience for ordinary oversight--just rush to grab the bluntest ,Public
tool available to make a political statement against the President. ,Public
Well this war powers debate bears an eerie resemblance to that ,Public
  To listen to some of the advocates of Senator Kaine's resolution you ,Public
would think that sweeping resolutions like this were the only means ,Public
available to Senators to express any discomfort with White House ,Public
  If Senators' priority is genuine oversight there are countless tools ,Public
in their toolbox. They can hold hearings. They can engage the ,Public
administration directly. They can ask questions and raise issues they ,Public
feel were not sufficiently addressed in interagency deliberations.,Public
  Instead like impeachment this War Powers Resolution cuts short that ,Public
interplay between the branches. It short-circuits the thoughtful ,Public
deliberation and debate. It is a dangerously overbroad resolution that ,Public
should not pass Congress and is certain to be vetoed if it does. If my ,Public
colleagues want to make a real difference this is not the way to go.,Public
  The amendments my Rean colleagues and I have filed expose the ,Public
shortcomings and unintended risks of this approach.,Public
  Senator Kaine has drafted a rule of construction that tries to ,Public
provide an exception allowing U.S. troops to defend themselves against ,Public
an attack if it is ``imminent.'' My amendment exposes the absurdity of ,Public
  How imminent exactly is imminent enough? When do our men and women ,Public
in uniform get to defend themselves? I would like to know. Should our ,Public
servicemembers need to sit on intelligence until an attack is a week ,Public
away? A day away? An hour away? Until they see the whites of the ,Public
  And who makes the determination about imminence? Five hundred thirty-,Public
five Members of Congress? The President? A Pentagon lawyer? A ,Public
  This resolution imposes a new constraint on the military without ,Public
  If we have intelligence warning that an enemy is planning to attack ,Public
our forces can we not disrupt the plot until the attack is almost ,Public
  Senators Cotton Rounds and Sullivan have also filed amendments. ,Public
They propose sensible additions to give our troops and their commanders ,Public
more confidence we aren't trying to tie their hands against precisely ,Public
the threat they might face if Iran were again to become emboldened ,Public
enough to attack us--oh and to make sure we can defend our diplomats ,Public
and Embassies too if they were to face renewed threats.,Public
  So clearly this resolution is not ready for prime time. I believe it ,Public
is just an effort to broadcast a political message but even that ,Public
message can be harmful to our troops and to our national security.,Public
  So what message will the Senate send to American servicemembers? ,Public
Should they doubt whether their own leaders are authorized to defend ,Public
them? What message should we send to our regional allies and partners? ,Public
Can they count on continued solidarity from the United States? What ,Public
would it say to real great-power competitors like Russia and China if ,Public
we cannot even remain united in the face of a lesser challenge such as ,Public

   SECTION 5(C) OF THE WAR POWERS RESOLUTION TO TERMINATE THE USE OF ,Public
 UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES TO ENGAGE IN HOSTILITIES IN OR AGAINST IRAN,Public
  Mr. UDALL submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was ,Public
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives ,Public
     SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES ,Public
       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:,Public
       (1) The Government of Iran is a leading state sponsor of ,Public
     terrorism and engages in a range of destabilizing activities ,Public
     across the Middle East. Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was ,Public
     the lead architect of much of Iran's destabilizing activities ,Public
       (2) The United States has an inherent right to self-defense ,Public
     against imminent armed attacks. The United States maintains ,Public
     the right to ensure the safety of diplomatic personnel ,Public
       (3) In matters of imminent armed attacks the executive ,Public
     branch should indicate to Congress why military action was ,Public
     necessary within a certain window of opportunity the ,Public
     possible harm that missing the window would cause and why ,Public
     the action was likely to prevent future disastrous attacks ,Public
       (4) The United States has national interests in preserving ,Public
     its partnership with Iraq and other countries in the region ,Public
       (A) combating terrorists including the Islamic State of ,Public
       (B) preventing Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons ,Public
     countries throughout the Middle East who demand an end to ,Public
     government corruption and violations of basic human rights.,Public
       (5) Over the past eight months in response to rising ,Public
     tensions with Iran the United States has introduced over ,Public
       (6) When the United States uses military force the ,Public
     American people and members of the United States Armed Forces ,Public
     deserve a credible explanation regarding such use of military ,Public
       (7) The War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.) ,Public
     requires the President to consult with Congress ``in every ,Public
     possible instance'' before introducing United States Armed ,Public
       (8) Congress has not authorized the President to use ,Public
       (b) Termination.--Pursuant to section 5(c) of the War ,Public
     Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) Congress hereby ,Public
     directs the President to terminate the use of United States ,Public
     Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran or ,Public
       (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory ,Public
     authorization for such use of the Armed Forces; or,Public
     appropriate to defend against an imminent armed attack upon ,Public
     the United States its territories or possessions or its ,Public
     Armed Forces consistent with the requirements of the War ,Public
       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be ,Public
       (1) to prevent the President from using military force ,Public
       (2) to limit the obligations of the executive branch set ,Public
     forth in the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.);,Public
       (3) to affect the provisions of an Act or joint resolution ,Public
     of Congress specifically authorizing the use of United States ,Public
     Armed Forces to engage in hostilities against Iran or any ,Public
     part of its government or military that is enacted after the ,Public
     date of the adoption of this concurrent resolution;,Public

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of ,Public
Jan-032019 the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) is ,Public
recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the ,Public
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker throughout the debate yesterday on the ,Public
so-called War Powers Resolution fundamental misunderstandings surfaced ,Public
  The first misunderstanding is that the justification for the attack ,Public
that killed Soleimani was that he was an evil terrorist responsible for ,Public
the deaths of hundreds of Americans. Well there are a lot of evil ,Public
terrorists out there and that does not give the President authority to ,Public
  But what did give the President authority in this case was the fact ,Public
that Soleimani was acting as an armed combatant against U.S. forces in ,Public
a war zone in which the Congress had authorized the President to take ,Public
military action through the Authorization for the Use of Military Force ,Public
  Now I hate to shock my woke colleagues but killing active enemy ,Public
combatants is what war is all about and it is a war that Congress ,Public
  That act of Congress provides: ``The President is authorized to use ,Public
the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary ,Public
and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United ,Public
States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.'',Public
  The very nature of this authority includes combating hostile militia ,Public
and armed proxies acting within Iraq against American forces. That is ,Public
  The authorization to use military force did not end with the defeat ,Public
of Saddam Hussein any more than the President's military authority in ,Public
Japan and Germany ended with the defeat of Hirohito and Hitler.,Public
  In those cases the President's authority didn't terminate until 1952 ,Public
and 1955 respectively and the President's military authority in Iraq ,Public
remains in effect until the President and Congress terminate it.,Public
  Now the second misunderstanding is that the President's action was ,Public
an attack on Iran. It most certainly was not. It was carried out in the ,Public
theater of war defined by Congress against a combatant who was ,Public
commanding hostile forces against American troops.,Public
  Not only did the President act entirely within his legal authority as ,Public
Commander in Chief but within his moral responsibility to protect ,Public
American military and diplomatic personnel and American citizens in ,Public
  The third misunderstanding is that the War Powers Act is applicable ,Public
in this circumstance. The War Powers Act governs only those ,Public
circumstances when the President responds without congressional ,Public
authority to an attack upon the United States its territory or ,Public
possessions or its Armed Forces. In this case the President already ,Public
  The fourth misunderstanding is that the attack on Soleimani was ,Public
equivalent to President Obama's attack on Libya. The two are entirely ,Public
different matters. The attack on Libya had no congressional ,Public
authorization and the War Powers Act did not apply because Mr. Obama's ,Public
military attack was not in response to an attack on the United States ,Public
  It was an entirely unprovoked attack entirely unauthorized and ,Public
  I think as we go forward we need to get back to some basic ,Public
fundamental understandings about the constitutional parameters of war ,Public
  The American Founders made a sharp distinction between starting a war ,Public
and waging a war for some very good reasons. They understood that this ,Public
most solemn and lethal decision should not be entrusted to one ,Public
individual whose authority would be greatly augmented by it.,Public
  The decision to start a war was given exclusively to Congress to ,Public
assure that every voice in the country was heard and that Congress ,Public
once having taken that stand would be obligated to put the resources ,Public
of the country behind that war and those fighting it.,Public
  But once the war has begun the Founders wanted a single Commander in ,Public
Chief directing it with clear and unambiguous authority. There is no ,Public
surer path to military disaster than having 535 squabbling prima donnas ,Public
  Thus the President can wage war but cannot declare it and the ,Public
  The Founders debated these principles thoroughly during the ,Public
Constitutional Convention. They recognized that the President did need ,Public
certain residual military power to repel an attack when Congress ,Public
couldn't act. And I believe the War Powers Act faithfully defines these ,Public
circumstances and establishes a framework to contain them.,Public
  But the War Powers Act does not give the President the authority to,Public
launch military attacks except in response to a direct attack on our ,Public
country nor can it limit the President's authority as Commander in ,Public
  I believe the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force in ,Public
Iraq was a colossal mistake. It created a dangerous power vacuum. It ,Public
was never supported with the full resources of the United States and ,Public
  But there should be no rewriting of history here. It might have been ,Public
George W. Bush who advocated for the war and Bush Obama and now ,Public
President Trump who have waged it but it was Congress' adoption of the ,Public
  And once started only the President can wage it. President Trump ,Public
inherited this mess and history will judge how well he handles it. ,Public
Certainly in this instance the President not only had clear and ,Public
unambiguous authority to order the attack he had a moral imperative to ,Public
  What is crystal clear from the debate yesterday is that if the ,Public
Democrats had had their way Soleimani would be alive today and the ,Public
attack on American troops that he was in the final stages of planning ,Public
would have unfolded. We would likely today be mourning very many ,Public
  If the President knowing that this attack was coming and in full ,Public
possession of the opportunity and the authority to stop it had taken ,Public
the Democrats' advice and done nothing he would have been deeply ,Public
culpable for the loss of these Americans. It is shocking to me and ,Public
perhaps to the country as well that even in hindsight this is the ,Public
course the Democrats have made clear that they prefer.,Public
  That brings me to the nature of the resolution that the House passed ,Public
yesterday. The separation of war powers between the legislative and ,Public
executive branches has been badly blurred in recent decades and I do ,Public
believe that we need to reestablish not only the constitutional ,Public
principles that separate the declaring of war from the waging of war ,Public
but also the American tradition that we only go to war when we have ,Public
  When we must go to war we have the utmost obligation to put the ,Public
entire might and resources and attention of the Nation behind it and ,Public
  Now that is a legitimate debate to have but that is not what the ,Public
House did yesterday. Yesterday it deliberately and recklessly ,Public
undermined the position of the United States Government and the United ,Public
States Armed Forces that we sent to Iraq shredding the tradition that ,Public
  In a perilous moment the House refused to stand behind the war that ,Public
it had authorized in 2002 refused to protect the men and women that it ,Public
placed in harm's way and it gave a hostile foreign power a major ,Public
  That is yet another stain upon the honor of this House and one which ,Public
should be deplored and condemned through the ages to come.,Public
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov],Public
  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President on another matter this week we ,Public
expect the Senate will take up a War Powers Resolution by the junior ,Public
Senator from Virginia that would severely limit the U.S. military's ,Public
operational flexibility to defend itself against threats posed by Iran. ,Public
I will strongly oppose our colleague's effort and urge the Senate to ,Public
  First let's discuss what prompted this: the President's successful ,Public
decision to remove Soleimani from the battlefield last month. This ,Public
limited yet decisive precision strike eliminated the terrorist ,Public
mastermind who had been responsible for more American military ,Public
  This was not some reckless act. It was a calculated and limited ,Public
response to a significant growing threat of attack against U.S. ,Public
personnel in Iraq by an emboldened adversary. Years ago Soleimani had ,Public
concluded America was a paper tiger whose people he could kill with ,Public
relative impunity. It was a strike designed to stop an escalation cycle ,Public
we all knew was underway and to restore deterrence and reduce the risk ,Public
  Yet when Soleimani's record of brutality was brought to an end some ,Public
Washington Democrats immediately suggested President Trump was leading ,Public
us into World War III. While the Middle East masses rejoiced at the ,Public
death of a principal architect of Iran's campaign of terror the ,Public
  Yet thus far it appears the Soleimani strike has indeed had the ,Public
intended effect. As I observed back in January ``We appear to have ,Public
restored a measure of deterrence in the Middle East. So let's not screw ,Public
it up.'' Well I am afraid that is just what our colleague's resolution ,Public
would do. Just as we have successfully sent Iran the strong signal of ,Public
our strength and resolve a blunt and clumsy War Powers Resolution ,Public
  With China's and Russia's watching is it really a good idea to ,Public
suggest that we are willing to let a meddling power like Iran push us ,Public
around? This self-flagellation and self-limitation would be tantamount ,Public
  For 8 years President Obama and Senate Democrats like my friend the ,Public
Democratic leader himself frequently said that when it comes to Iran ,Public
we should never take the military option off the table. Yet now that ,Public
someone else is in the Oval Office they seem to want to remove all ,Public
options from the table. Lest we forget the fact is that we are not ,Public
conducting ongoing hostilities with Iran. This was a one-off operation ,Public
to disrupt and deter planned attacks--not a campaign not a conflict ,Public
  This discrete and limited exercise of American power pales in ,Public
comparison to the ways in which past Presidents of both parties have ,Public
routinely used Presidential authorities to utilize our military might ,Public
without their having the prior consent of Congress--President Clinton ,Public
  Do most of my distinguished Democratic colleagues really agree with ,Public
several of their party's leading Presidential candidates who have ,Public
suggested President Trump made a mistake by taking this sort of ,Public
Executive action to eliminate this brutal terrorist?,Public
  Do my colleagues really agree with the prominent voices on their side ,Public
who have proposed to exit the Middle East altogether rather than to ,Public
continue to work to support our local partners and defend our national ,Public
security and national interests in this critical region?,Public
  I have been trying to have this broader debate for more than a year ,Public
now. I have repeatedly sought to give my Democratic colleagues the ,Public
opportunity to go on record about their actual big-picture strategic ,Public
  Are they willing to support a continued military presence in Syria? ,Public
in Iraq? Do they believe we can magically support our partners like ,Public
the Kurds without having a military presence; that we can counter ,Public
Iranian and Russian influence if we are nowhere to be found in the ,Public
region? Do they believe Israel will be safer in a region without ,Public
  Ill-conceived potshots at Presidential authorities--in the wake of a ,Public
strike that succeeded--by using the blunt instrument of a War Powers ,Public
Resolution is no substitute at all for answering these broader ,Public

even worse foreign policy mistake in the Middle East. He recklessly and ,Public
impatiently took us to the brink of war that would have been even ,Public
  Now yesterday I went to the so-called intelligence briefing. They ,Public
offered no intelligence regarding immediate imminent threats to the ,Public
  They did certainly make a case that Soleimani was a rotten guy and he ,Public
was responsible for many many deaths of Americans and others in the ,Public
region but that is all recited past history that didn't talk about any ,Public
immediate threats or any intelligence that would lead to it.,Public
  They further went on to say that the legal justification was the ,Public
Authorization for Use of Military Force in the invasion of Iraq which ,Public
of course was based on phony intelligence regarding weapons of mass ,Public
destruction he didn't have. So that is even more extraordinary if you ,Public
  Last week also the President tweeted what he said was his ,Public
compliance with war powers. He then went on to tweet a threat of all-,Public
out war against Iran and then he went further to tweet that he would ,Public
order that war crimes be committed during an all-out war against Iran.,Public
  That was walked back a little bit by the Secretary of Defense who ,Public
said they would follow the law. And then Trump later said: I like laws. ,Public
I will follow the laws. So he walked back from saying he was going to ,Public
  Today on the floor of the House we will take up a rebuke of the ,Public
President for those actions. Hopefully we will go further and we will ,Public
repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force from 2002 based on ,Public
  We will further hopefully take up legislation that was adopted as ,Public
an amendment to the defense authorization last summer with bipartisan ,Public
support to say that the President couldn't initiate hostilities ,Public
  Congress has the authority and only Congress has the authority to ,Public
declare war. Once we are at war the President as Commander in Chief ,Public
  But the President does not have the authority. This is ,Public
extraconstitutional when it isn't an attack or an imminent attack on ,Public
  Further we need to fix the War Powers Act. That was adopted after ,Public
the illegal actions of another President Richard Nixon the bombing of ,Public
  There were two versions. One followed the Constitution and said no ,Public
no any offensive actions into hostilities you first have to come to ,Public
Congress. The second version said well you can initiate them but you ,Public
have to report within 48 hours and if Congress doesn't authorize it ,Public
within 60 days you have to withdraw. That was defective and weak and ,Public
doesn't reflect at all the congressional duties of this body.,Public
  Now I know a lot of Members love to dodge the issues of war and ,Public
peace--it is the toughest vote you can make--and that is essentially ,Public
what they did at the time a wink and a nod: Well we will let the ,Public
President do these things. Hey if it works out we will take credit; ,Public
if it doesn't work out oh well then we can castigate him later.,Public
  So I have introduced yet again a bill that comprehensively reforms ,Public
the War Powers Act to reflect the constitutional authorities and duties ,Public
of the United States Congress. It would say that the President cannot ,Public
initiate hostilities without first coming to Congress.,Public
  It would define what consultation means. It doesn't mean a tweet to ,Public
the Congress. It doesn't mean sending up a letter. It means a ,Public
meaningful consultation. It establishes an executive legislative ,Public
  It also includes most importantly a sunset clause for any ,Public
  I mean a thousand years from now the United States I guess if we ,Public
don't repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force can ,Public
attack whatever Iraq is a thousand years from now. That is absolutely ,Public
  Finally it does give Congress the authority and standing to go to ,Public
the courts should the President violate the Constitution and the War ,Public
  I have had problems with both Democratic and Rean Presidents ,Public
over this issue over the years: Clinton Bosnia; Bush obviously in a ,Public
number of cases; and then Obama in Libya and other things that they ,Public
did also based on the fake intelligence in the 2002 authorization.,Public

  Mr. COTTON. Madam President in the next few days Senate Democrats ,Public
will move to discharge a War Powers Resolution to tie the President's ,Public
hands in defending this Nation against Iran and terrorist masterminds ,Public
like Qasem Soleimani. Let's think about how we got here and the ,Public
  Qasem Soleimani has the blood of thousands of Americans on his hands ,Public
and hundreds of thousands of innocent souls across the Middle East. For ,Public
more than 20 years he was the Supreme Leader's most trusted ,Public
lieutenant Iran's terror mastermind and the man responsible for the ,Public
deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan by ,Public
supplying the most deadly kinds of roadside bombs soldiers ever faced. ,Public
He and his proxies and Iranian leaders like him are responsible for ,Public
bombings of our Embassies in places like Lebanon and Kuwait. They are ,Public
in no small part responsible for the ongoing horror of the Syrian ,Public
civil war for the civil war in Yemen. There is no doubt based on the ,Public
intelligence we have and this bloodthirsty past that Qasem Soleimani ,Public
was in Baghdad on January 2 to plot something very dangerous and very ,Public
big that was going to target Americans once again.,Public
  We should all be thankful that Qasem Soleimani no longer walks the ,Public
Earth and we should be proud of the troops who executed that mission. ,Public
The world is a safer place and America is a safer nation because of it. ,Public
The people of Iran have been given a voice against the man who was ,Public
responsible for mowing them down in protests over the years and whose ,Public
death they have been out on the streets celebrating even though they ,Public
risk being mowed down by their own security forces once again.,Public
  Yet over the last 2 weeks the Democrats have been able to do ,Public
nothing but express their regret for the President's decision to ,Public
eliminate Qasem Soleimani. And make no mistake--this War Powers ,Public
Resolution is not about the future; it is about delivering an implicit ,Public
or if you listen to their words and don't just read the resolution an ,Public
explicit rebuke to the President for ordering the killing of Qasem ,Public
Soleimani. They certainly want to prevent the President from doing ,Public
anything like that in the future. That is why they have introduced this ,Public
  We should always remind ourselves when we are having a war powers ,Public
debate as we do from time to time the War Powers Resolution is ,Public
unconstitutional. It was passed by a liberal Congress in 1973 at the ,Public
height of Watergate and not a single President since then has ,Public
acknowledged its constitutionality--not a single one to include all ,Public
  I hear a lot about the Constitution these days and reclaiming our ,Public
authority to declare war and to constrain the Executive. I guess all ,Public
those constitutional experts missed the Federalist Papers and their ,Public
authoritative explanation of the Constitution and why we have the ,Public
government we do. We have a House of Representatives with 435 people to ,Public
be the institution that is most closely tied to popular opinion. We ,Public
have a Senate to act as the cool and deliberate sense of community. And ,Public
we have a single President--a single President--to act on behalf of the ,Public
  Federalist 70 if they would just open up that authoritative ,Public
explanation of the Constitution says why there is one President not a ,Public
council of two or three or four as some of the States had at the time ,Public
of the founding. Because of the division of opinion and perspective and ,Public
temperament that an executive council would have there is one ,Public
President--one President--who can act as Federalist 70 said with ,Public
energy and dispatch and yes in some occasions with secrecy. So if ,Public
the Founders didn't think we should have an executive council of 3 or 4 ,Public
or 5 people imagine what they would have thought about 535 commanders ,Public
in chief making operational decisions about when to take action on the ,Public
  These debates about War Powers Resolutions are really about how many ,Public
lawyers and armchair rangers can dance on the head of a pin. Do you ,Public
think wars and battles are won with paper resolutions? Those wars and ,Public
battles are won with iron resolution. Do you think the ayatollahs are ,Public
intimidated by ``whereas'' clauses and joint resolutions? The ,Public
ayatollahs are intimidated deterred and scared when we incinerate ,Public
their terror mastermind and we tell them that we will do it again if ,Public
  Even if you grant the War Powers Resolution constitutional look at ,Public
the actual text of this resolution. It makes no exception for Iran ,Public
developing a nuclear weapon. The ayatollahs could hold a press ,Public
conference tomorrow or the Supreme Leader could tweet that they are ,Public
going to rush to a nuclear breakout. The President would have to come ,Public
to Congress if he would want to take any kind of action to deter it. It ,Public
makes no exception for designated terrorist organizations and ,Public
individuals like the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Quds ,Public
Force who have killed so many Americans and continue to target them ,Public
today. It makes no exception for attacks on our allies in the Middle ,Public
  The sponsor of this resolution will say: Oh it makes an exception ,Public
  We have seen what that gets us over the last couple of weeks--again ,Public
lawyers and armchair rangers arguing about the meaning of ,Public
``imminence.'' Well I have to say that whether an attack is imminent ,Public
looks pretty different if you are a soldier on patrol in Iraq than if ,Public
you are a comfortable Senator sitting behind secure walls and armed ,Public
  None of this means Congress has no role in matters of life and death ,Public
on the battlefield. It is very far from it in fact and I will take a ,Public
back seat to no one in asserting that constitutional authority. I would ,Public
remind my colleagues that when we had an opportunity to insist that ,Public
Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran be submitted to this Chamber as a ,Public
treaty there was one Senator who voted to insist on that--only one. ,Public
This guy. Ninety-eight other Senators were perfectly willing to create ,Public
some made-up phony-baloney procedure that allowed Barack Obama to ,Public
submit a nuclear arms agreement with a sworn and mortal enemy that ,Public
chants ``Death to America'' and put it into effect with a large ,Public
majority opposed to him as opposed to the two-thirds majority that our ,Public
  We do have a tremendous degree of constitutional authority in the ,Public
Congress. We regulate interstate commerce which means sanctions. We ,Public
confirm Ambassadors. We confirm the President's Cabinet. We declare ,Public
war which we have done only a few times in our past despite hundreds ,Public
of instances of introducing troops. But most importantly and the way ,Public
to constrain the Executive if this Congress thinks he should be ,Public
constrained in a particular case we have the spending power--in ,Public
particular the spending power for our Armed Forces. That is the way ,Public
the Congress--any Congress with any President--can control the use of ,Public
the Armed Forces by the President. It is something this Congress has ,Public
done a lot in the past. We did it in Vietnam did it in Nicaragua and ,Public
  There were plenty of times where the President has acted in some ways ,Public
in a much more aggressive and far-reaching fashion than President Trump ,Public
did just a couple weeks ago--the first Taiwan Strait crisis Granada in ,Public
1983 Libya in 1986 and Iran in 1988. I would even say Libya again in ,Public
2011 although most of my Democratic colleagues like to send that down ,Public
the memory hole since it was a Democratic President.,Public
  So I would simply say that if you disagree with the President's ,Public
decision to kill the world's most sadistic bloodthirsty terrorist ,Public
mastermind and you want to stop him from doing so again file your bill ,Public
to prohibit the use of any taxpayer funds for such operations. It is ,Public
very simple. It is one page. I will help you write it if you need ,Public
help--one page: No funds will be used to support operations by the ,Public
Armed Forces against the Government of Iran or any of its officials. Do ,Public
  Why are we not seeing that bill? Because it failed just last year. ,Public
All of these same politicians offered language on our annual Defense ,Public
bill to try to prohibit the use of any funds in operations like we just ,Public
saw and it failed. We passed a defense bill as we always do by ,Public
overwhelming majorities which means they don't have the votes because ,Public
they know their position is not popular with the American people. Not ,Public
surprisingly the American people don't want their elected leaders to ,Public
  So if you are not going to act in what is our true constitutional ,Public
power spare us the unconstitutional and dangerous War Powers ,Public

  The resolution before us today needlessly politicizes our national ,Public

  Let's be clear. President Trump's decisive and defensive action to ,Public
eliminate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force commander ,Public
Qasem Soleimani is not the reason for the recent escalation between ,Public
the United States and Iran. The President ordered the strike because of ,Public
Iran's own escalation and aggression for which General Soleimani was ,Public

  In fact President Trump has demonstrated enormous restraint in his ,Public
targeted action against Soleimani making this vote entirely ,Public
unnecessary. There was no invasion of Iran but a strike against a ,Public
terrorist in a country we had the legal authority to operate in under ,Public
the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force.,Public
  Mr. Speaker you have heard many of my colleagues doubt the ,Public
applicability of that AUMF so for those colleagues who are unconvinced ,Public
that that is a sufficient authority consider the fact that even in the ,Public
absence of explicit congressional authorization for the Soleimani ,Public
strike here is a helpful reminder: Article II Section 2 of the ,Public
Constitution provides that: The President shall be Commander in Chief. ,Public
And it is true that the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to ,Public
declare war and the sole power of the purse to either fund or defund ,Public
military action but dating back to the Prize cases in 1863 the ,Public
Supreme Court has long held that the President may act without Congress ,Public
  In recent years the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has ,Public
opined that the Constitution authorizes the President as Commander in ,Public
Chief to order military action without congressional permission if the ,Public
President determines that the action would be anticipatory self-defense ,Public
or otherwise serves the interest of the United States at least where ,Public
the nature scope and duration of the anticipated hostilities are ,Public
  Specifically the OLC has said the President's inherent ,Public
constitutional authority as Commander in Chief his broad foreign ,Public
policy powers and his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully ,Public
executed empower him to deplore the armed forces abroad without a ,Public
declaration of war by Congress or other congressional authorization.,Public
  The courts have generally declined to review the exercise of such ,Public
  The War Powers Resolution does not limit the President's power to act ,Public
without Congress. At most it imposes a reporting and consultation ,Public
requirement that this President has complied with.,Public
  Furthermore the War Powers Resolution applies only to the deployment ,Public
of significant bodies of military personnel and would not apply to a ,Public

  Of course that is precisely the scenario here involving the ,Public
President's decisive strike against Soleimani in response to an attack ,Public
  Thank goodness we have a Commander in Chief who will not allow ,Public
another Benghazi on his watch. Don't forget the Framers of the ,Public

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President H. Con. Res. 83 directs the President to ,Public
terminate the use of U.S. Armed Forces to engage in hostilities against ,Public
Iran unless Congress has authorized the use of military force against ,Public
Iran or such use is necessary to defend against an imminent armed ,Public
attack. H. Con. Res. 83 was agreed to in the House of Representatives ,Public
on January 9 2020 and received in the Senate and referred to the ,Public
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on January 132020,Public
  The War Powers Resolution PL 93-148 has special procedures ,Public
underscoring the privileged nature of a concurrent resolution like H. ,Public
Con. Res. 83. Section 1546(c) of the War Powers Resolution requires ,Public
that once a privileged concurrent resolution such as H. Con. Res. 83 ,Public
has been passed by the House it must be referred to the Senate Foreign ,Public
Relations Committee and ``shall be reported out by such committee ,Public
together with its recommendations within fifteen calendar days.'' ,Public
days from January 13 is today January 28 2020. Under the law the ,Public
concurrent resolution may be reported out with a favorable or ,Public
unfavorable recommendation or no recommendation at all but it must be ,Public
  Unfortunately it appears that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ,Public
majority leadership has decided to allow the 15 calendar days to lapse ,Public
without taking action on H. Con. Res. 83. This failure to act leaves a ,Public
  I understand that the chairman is basing this inaction primarily on ,Public
the contention that a concurrent resolution under 50 U.S.C. 1544(c) may ,Public
be privileged only if it uses the word ``remove'' or the phrase ,Public
``removal of United States Armed Forces engaged in hostilities'' ,Public
rather than ``terminate'' or ``terminate the use of United States Armed ,Public
Forces to engage in hostilities'' as used in H. Con. Res. 83. The ,Public
argument appears to be that the use of ``removed'' in 1544(c) of the ,Public
War Powers Resolution eliminates the possibility of privilege if any ,Public
other terminology is used regardless of functional equivalency. This ,Public
argument suggests that ``removal'' is a term of art required for ,Public
  The approach is unjustifiably restrictive. Treating ``removal'' as a ,Public
term of art required for privilege is inconsistent with the overarching ,Public
purpose of the War Powers Resolution and without support in either the ,Public
statutory framework or legislative history. It also undermines Senate ,Public
  The purpose of the War Powers Resolution was for Congress to ,Public
reconfirm and reassert its constitutional powers over ``undeclared'' ,Public
wars. The availability of a privileged and binding resolution to force ,Public
a President to stop using U.S. Armed Forces in hostilities is central ,Public
to that purpose. Limiting such privilege to a single phrase or word is ,Public
inconsistent with this reassertion of congressional powers and is ,Public
neither a feature of the statute nor its legislative history.,Public
  The statutory framework of the War Powers Resolution does not support ,Public
the assertion that ``removal'' or ``removal from hostilities'' are ,Public
terms of art that are required for and exclusive to the availability of ,Public
privilege. To the contrary those terms are not defined in law; nor is ,Public
there any reference in the statute to a military or other usage of ,Public
those phrases to suggest that they are terms of art.,Public
  The absence of statutorily mandated language for privilege in the War ,Public
Powers Resolution directly contrasts with many other statutes in which ,Public
Congress expressly requires specific language for privilege to attach. ,Public
For example in contrast to the War Powers Resolution section 130(f) ,Public
of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 PL 83-703 section 101 of the Arms ,Public
Export Control Act PL 90-629 and section 216(c) of the Countering ,Public
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act PL 115-44 all require ,Public
specific text for privileged resolutions and provide that text in ,Public
quotations in the statute. Clearly as evidenced by laws enacted before ,Public
and after the War Powers Resolution Congress knows how to require the ,Public
use of unique statutorily mandated language for privilege to apply. ,Public
The fact that it did not do so in the War Powers Resolution ,Public
demonstrates that there was no intent to limit privilege to use of a ,Public
  Further the legislative record of the War Powers Resolution does not ,Public
support the assertion that there is an exclusive connection between the ,Public
use of ``removal'' and the availability of privilege. To the contrary ,Public
the record indicates that ``remove'' and ``terminate'' were used ,Public
synonymously. The record is replete with the interchangeable usage of ,Public
synonymous terms consistent with a cessation of the use of U.S. forces ,Public
in hostilities. For example House Report 93-287 uses no less than ,Public
seven terms in this regard including ``conclude'' ``disengage'' ,Public
``remove'' ``terminate'' ``abandon such action'' and ``stop.'' In ,Public
fact the conferees even used ``terminate'' to describe the privileged ,Public
resolution envisioned in 1544(c) clearly demonstrating that these ,Public
terms were considered to be functionally equivalent for purposes of War ,Public
Powers. ``The House joint resolution provided that use of United States ,Public
Armed Forces by the President without a declaration of war or specific ,Public
statutory authorization could be terminated by Congress through the use ,Public
of a concurrent resolution. The Senate amendment provided for such ,Public
termination by a bill or joint resolution.'' H. Rept. 93-547 ,Public
Conference Report to H.J. Res. 542. This legislative history in tandem ,Public
with a statutory construct that does not require a term of art ,Public
demonstrates that the insistence on such a term for privilege is ,Public
  Finally strictly limiting privilege to a resolution that uses ,Public
``remove'' is inconsistent with Senate and congressional perogatives. ,Public
The purpose of the War Powers Resolution--reasserting the power of ,Public
Congress over undeclared wars--can be vindicated only if the executive ,Public
branch and its supporters in the Senate cannot use committee or floor ,Public
procedure to bottle up a resolution consistent with both the purpose ,Public
and construct of the War Powers Resolution. Reading into the statute a ,Public
requirement for specific terminology where no such requirement exists ,Public
unjustifiably restricts Senate action and limits the reassertion of ,Public

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President I rise to express a concern over the ,Public
Rubio amendment to the Sanders-Lee joint resolution S.J. Res. 7 which ,Public
  The Rubio amendment attempts to make clear that nothing in the joint ,Public
resolution is intended or may be interpreted to affect any intelligence ,Public
or counterintelligence activity or investigations relating to threats ,Public
in or from Yemen which involves the collection analysis or sharing ,Public
  I do not believe that it was the intention of the authors of S.J. ,Public
Res. 7 to restrict these intelligence activities per se. I believe it ,Public
was Senator Rubio's intention to make sure that that legitimate ,Public
intelligence activities as specified were not affected.,Public
  However my concern springs from the full implications of what ,Public
``sharing intelligence'' means. I assume it is meant to share useful ,Public
intelligence the United States may acquire about the intentions ,Public
activities characteristics and other information about for example ,Public
the Houthis or Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That is entirely ,Public
  But if the intelligence being shared is actually information that ,Public
allows Saudi Arabia or other members of the Saudi-led coalition to ,Public
specifically target and conduct military operations such as ,Public
airstrikes against specific sites in Yemen then that would get ,Public
perilously close to the U.S. being directly involved in hostilities in ,Public
  Section 8 of the War Powers Resolution considers U.S. Armed Forces to ,Public
be ``introduced into hostilities'' if among other activities members ,Public
of the U.S. Armed Forces ``coordinate'' the activities of foreign ,Public
forces. Arguably enabling Saudi forces to target specific sites in ,Public
Yemen could constitute ``coordination'' under the War Powers ,Public
  Why is this important? It is important first to preserve the scope ,Public
of application of the War Powers Resolution which the Congress enacted ,Public
to rein in the power of the executive branch to make war anywhere under ,Public
  Second the more direct assistance U.S. Armed Forces provide to the ,Public
Saudi-led coalition the closer they are associated with the actions of ,Public
those countries. That could lead to shared liability in those ,Public
activities if and when those activities lead inadvertently or ,Public
  Again I do not believe that it was the intention of the author of ,Public
this amendment to create the legal space for this to occur. I would ,Public
advise the Department of Defense and the appropriate intelligence ,Public
agencies to be mindful of this issue and be cautious about what ,Public
intelligence information is shared and for what purposes it is used.,Public
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov],Public
  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President last week we were very close to an act of ,Public
war between the United States and Iran. I must tell you we have been ,Public
talking about this potential threat for a long time. I am a member of ,Public
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We have held numerous meetings ,Public
in our discussion about the fact that there is no authorization for the ,Public
use of military force by the United States against Iran that has been ,Public
approved by Congress. I remember during hearings listening to ,Public
administrative witnesses who said: Well there is no intent to use ,Public
  Well Congress did not act. Even though I must tell you several of ,Public
our colleagues including this Senator had urged us to take up an ,Public
authorization for the use of military force in regards to the problems ,Public
in the Middle East there was no action taken. I want to applaud ,Public
Senator Kaine who has been working on this for several years and our ,Public
former colleague Senator Flake who did everything they could to bring ,Public
a bipartisan discussion and action in regards to exercising ,Public
congressional responsibility on the use of force by our military.,Public
  Well we now know that this is a real threat that we may be going to ,Public
war without Congress's involvement which is contrary not only to our ,Public
Constitution but to the laws passed by the U.S. Congress. So I want to ,Public
thank Senator Kaine and Senator Lee for filing S.J. Res. 68 a ,Public
bipartisan resolution. I hope it will receive the expedited process ,Public
that is envisioned in the War Powers Resolution and I hope that we ,Public
will have a chance to act on this in the next few days. It is our ,Public
responsibility--Congress's responsibility--to commit our troops to ,Public
combat and it rests squarely with the legislative branch of ,Public
  Let me first cite the Constitution of the United States. You hear a ,Public
lot of discussion about the Constitution here on the floor of the U.S. ,Public
Senate. Article I section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress ,Public
  Now that was challenged in the 1970s after Congress had passed the ,Public
Gulf of Tonkin resolution in regards to our presence in Vietnam.,Public
  It was passed in an innocent way to protect American troops and ships ,Public
that were in that region but as we know that resolution was used as ,Public
justification by President Johnson and others to expand our involvement ,Public
in Vietnam and ultimately led to a very active and costly war for the ,Public
  In 1973 Congress passed the War Powers Act. It wasn't easy. ,Public
President Nixon vetoed it. We overrode the veto in a bipartisan vote in ,Public
the U.S. Congress. We did that because of the abuse of power during the ,Public
  Let me read what the War Powers Act provides because it is very ,Public
telling in regard to what we saw last week in regard to Iran a little ,Public
over a week ago now. It requires consultation with Congress by the ,Public
President ``in every possible instance before committing troops to ,Public
war.'' No. 1 it requires the President to consult with us before he ,Public
commits any of our troops to an engagement. No. 2 the President is ,Public
required to report within 48 hours ``into hostilities or into ,Public
situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly ,Public
indicated by the circumstances.'' So it provides for the imminent ,Public
  No. 3 the President is ``required to end foreign military action ,Public
after 60 days unless Congress provides a declaration of war or an ,Public
  We now know that to be an AUMF an authorization for the use of ,Public
  Let's fast forward from the passage of that bill in 1973 to rein in ,Public
the abuse of power by the Executive during the Vietnam war. Let's fast ,Public
forward to what happened in early January on January 2 when President ,Public
Trump ordered the action against Soleimani in Baghdad and took out his ,Public
  Let me start off by saying none of us has any sorrow over the loss ,Public
of General Soleimani. He was a bad guy. He was responsible for the ,Public
deaths of hundreds of people. He was very much a person who should have ,Public
been held accountable for his activities but there is a reason for our ,Public
constitutional protections of checks and balances as it relates to the ,Public
  The Commander in Chief has certain powers. Congress has certain ,Public
powers. The Framers of our Constitution intentionally provided for ,Public
there to be a robust discussion and debate between the legislature and ,Public
the Executive on war and peace; that we should have that open ,Public
discussion; and that in many cases diplomacy needs to be pursued much ,Public
more aggressively before we use our military might; that our national ,Public
security interest in keeping America safe rests with these checks and ,Public
balances. Again to bring it to current times in regard to the ,Public
circumstances with Iran every witness I have listened to every expert ,Public
I have talked to with regard to the Middle East says it is in the U.S. ,Public
national security interest to find a diplomatic way to handle our ,Public
issues in regard to Iran; that a military option would be very costly ,Public
a long time and most likely counterproductive with the United States ,Public
having to keep its troops in that region for a very long time.,Public
  Diplomacy is clearly the preferred path. These constitutional ,Public
provisions provide us with an opportunity to be able to make sure we do ,Public
what is in the best interest of American national security.,Public
  Trump ordered this attack and the Senate now needs to act as we saw ,Public
in the 1970s when Congress did act. Let me start with the War Powers ,Public
Act and how President Trump had violated the War Powers Act in all ,Public
  First was there an imminent involvement or threat? We have all now ,Public
heard the explanations given by this administration. It was short on ,Public
detail. It was basically the general concerns. What is most disturbing ,Public
we now read press accounts that the President had been planning for ,Public
months--or the generals had been planning and going over with the ,Public
President for months whether they should take out General Soleimani.,Public
  If they had been planning for months why didn't they consult with ,Public
Congress as required under the War Powers Act? Violation No. 1 to the ,Public
War Powers Act: Congress was not consulted by President Trump.,Public
  No. 2 there are two violations so far; the fact that there wasn't an ,Public
imminent threat and the fact that there was no consultation with ,Public
Congress--two violations of the War Powers Act. Then if he continues ,Public
to use force beyond the 60 days he has to come to Congress and get ,Public
  Does anyone here believe the President will not hesitate again to use ,Public
force against Iran? Yet there are no intentions to submit a resolution.,Public
  We find the President has violated the War Powers Act in three ways: ,Public
first by having no evidence of imminent threat; second by not ,Public
consulting with Congress before the attack; and third by not ,Public
submitting to us an authorization for the use of military force.,Public
  There are some who say the President already has that authority under ,Public
the authorizations for the use of military force that were passed by ,Public
Congress after the attack on our country on September 112001,Public
  We are getting to 18 years beyond when that attack took place and ,Public
those authorizations passed but let me go through them. The one that ,Public
is cited the most by the President is the 2002 which is to ``defend ,Public
the national security of the United States against the continuing ,Public
  First let me say I voted against that resolution and I believe ,Public
that was the correct vote but I think almost everybody in this body ,Public
would say that authorization is no longer relevant. Since that ,Public
resolution was passed the United States has worked with Iraq and has ,Public
worked with the Government of Iraq. This is a country we try to do ,Public
business with so they no longer present the threat that was supposedly ,Public
present when this resolution was passed. Even to get beyond that what ,Public
does Iran have to do with Iraq? I understand they may start with the ,Public
first letter ``I'' but there is no relationship here. Under any ,Public
stretch of the imagination there is no way you can use the 2002 ,Public
  Let's go to the 2001 resolution that was passed on the authorization ,Public
for use of military force. That was immediately after the attack on ,Public
September 11: `` . . . to use all necessary and appropriate force ,Public
against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned ,Public
authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on ,Public
Sep-112001 or harbored such organizations or persons.'',Public
  There is absolutely zero connection between that language and General ,Public
Soleimani or Iran as it relates to 9/11 and I think no one could make ,Public
  I understand that 2001 has been misused by many administrations. ,Public
There is no question I would concur in that conclusion but in all of ,Public
those cases they tried to connect dots. There is no connection of dots ,Public
  As we saw in the late 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam when we had the ,Public
Gulf of Tonkin resolution that was passed to defend our assets in the ,Public
Vietnam area--in the Gulf of Tonkin--how it was used by administrations ,Public
to commit us to a long engaged military operations. Here one cannot ,Public
argue that there is even a semblance of authorization that has been ,Public
  We also know the President is violating the War Powers Act and he is ,Public
likely to use force again in violation of our Constitution and the War ,Public
  It was my generation that paid a very heavy price because of the ,Public
Vietnam war. I lost a lot of my high school classmates in the Vietnam ,Public
war. Let us not exceed our responsibility under the Constitution or ,Public
allow the President to exceed his. We need to act. The Senate needs to ,Public
  The resolution before us allows us to do what is responsible. I am ,Public
going to quote from the resolution that Senator Kaine has filed S.J. ,Public
Res. 68: `` . . . the President to terminate the use of United States ,Public
Armed Forces for hostilities against . . . Iran or any part of its ,Public
government or military unless explicitly authorized by a declaration ,Public
of war or specific authorization for use of military force against ,Public
  By the way the resolution also provides that we always have the ,Public
right to defend ourselves from an imminent threat provided that it is ,Public
an imminent threat and that we comply with the War Powers Act--I am ,Public
  The President has a long track record of exceeding his constitutional ,Public
authority on matters of foreign policy. We cannot afford to become ,Public
accustomed or complacent in the face of those excesses. It is our ,Public
responsibility to carry out our constitutional responsibility.,Public
  I urge my colleagues to strongly support S.J. Res. 68 when we have a ,Public

  The text of the concurrent resolution as amended is as follows:,Public
       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate ,Public
     SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES ,Public
       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:,Public
       (1) The Government of Iran is a leading state sponsor of ,Public
     terrorism and engages in a range of destabilizing activities ,Public
     across the Middle East. Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was ,Public
     the lead architect of much of Iran's destabilizing activities ,Public
       (2) The United States has an inherent right to self-defense ,Public
     against imminent armed attacks. The United States maintains ,Public
     the right to ensure the safety of diplomatic personnel ,Public
       (3) In matters of imminent armed attacks the executive ,Public
     branch should indicate to Congress why military action was ,Public
     necessary within a certain window of opportunity the ,Public
     possible harm that missing the window would cause and why ,Public
     the action was likely to prevent future disastrous attacks ,Public
       (4) The United States has national interests in preserving ,Public
     its partnership with Iraq and other countries in the region ,Public
       (A) combating terrorists including the Islamic State of ,Public
       (B) preventing Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons ,Public
     countries throughout the Middle East who demand an end to ,Public
     government corruption and violations of basic human rights.,Public
       (5) Over the past eight months in response to rising ,Public
     tensions with Iran the United States has introduced over ,Public
       (6) When the United States uses military force the ,Public
     American people and members of the United States Armed Forces ,Public
     deserve a credible explanation regarding such use of military ,Public
       (7) The War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.) ,Public
     requires the President to consult with Congress ``in every ,Public
     possible instance'' before introducing United States Armed ,Public
       (8) Congress has not authorized the President to use ,Public
       (b) Termination.--Pursuant to section 5(c) of the War ,Public
     Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) Congress hereby ,Public
     directs the President to terminate the use of United States ,Public
     Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran or ,Public
       (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory ,Public
     authorization for such use of the Armed Forces; or,Public
     appropriate to defend against an imminent armed attack upon ,Public
     the United States its territories or possessions or its ,Public
     Armed Forces consistent with the requirements of the War ,Public
       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be ,Public
       (1) to prevent the President from using military force ,Public
       (2) to limit the obligations of the executive branch set ,Public
     forth in the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.);,Public
       (3) to affect the provisions of an Act or joint resolution ,Public
     of Congress specifically authorizing the use of United States ,Public
     Armed Forces to engage in hostilities against Iran or any ,Public
     part of its government or military that is enacted after the ,Public
     date of the adoption of this concurrent resolution;,Public
       (4) to prevent the use of necessary and appropriate ,Public
     military force to defend United States allies and partners if ,Public
     authorized by Congress consistent with the requirements of ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The concurrent resolution as amended shall ,Public
be debatable for 2 hours equally divided and controlled by the chair ,Public
and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.,Public
  The gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) and the gentleman from Texas ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members ,Public
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and ,Public
include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 83 currently under ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  We are here this afternoon so that this body can exercise one of its ,Public
important constitutional responsibilities deciding on whether or not ,Public
this country will wage war whether or not we will check an executive ,Public
that has brought our country to a dangerous brink.,Public
  In recent months tensions between the United States and Iran have ,Public
ticked up bit by bit until this last week when we found ourselves in ,Public
  Let's be clear: The Iranians are responsible for their own harmful ,Public
behavior. We know this is a regime that underwrites terrorism that ,Public
tries to strengthen its own position by fomenting instability and ,Public
provocation. We know that about Iran. No one expects Iran to be the ,Public
adult in the room when it comes to global affairs.,Public
  What we do expect is that American leadership and American policy ,Public
  So the world was stunned last week when the Trump administration ,Public
chose instead the path towards escalation with the killing of Qasem ,Public
  We need to be honest about Soleimani. He was a bad guy. He had ,Public
masterminded attacks and campaigns that cost thousands of innocent ,Public
lives. In the places where we have seen Iran's most harmful activity ,Public
Soleimani's fingerprints were everywhere. He had American blood on his ,Public
  But are we really safer today as the administration claims with ,Public
American citizens told to get out of Iraq as fast as they can; ,Public
thousands of troops deploying to the Middle East; an eviction notice ,Public
from the Iraqi Government whose partnership we depend on in the fight ,Public
against ISIS; Iranian missiles endangering American personnel?,Public
  It certainly doesn't feel like we are safer and a poll out today ,Public
  In foreign policy you have to weigh decisions like this. As awful as ,Public
Soleimani was this action has endangered American lives and American ,Public
  The President and his advisers say they had no choice; that there was ,Public
imminent threat. Then they said well he had done bad things in the ,Public
past and was going to do more bad things in the future. When they sent ,Public
a report on the strike to Congress the administration took the highly ,Public
  And then yesterday in a classified briefing when Members demanded ,Public
to see the evidence that justified the strike the message from the ,Public
administration essentially boiled down to this: Trust us. When we ,Public
asked What is the plan going forward? The administration essentially ,Public
  Trust us is not good enough Madam Speaker not for me and not for ,Public
  Madam Speaker if they are going to send our men and women in uniform ,Public
  First of all this administration hasn't given us any reason to ,Public
believe that this is a fact. The foreign policy of this administration ,Public
has undermined American leadership cut our diplomats off at the knees ,Public
alienated our allies and walked away from our obligations. We have ,Public
lurched from crisis to crisis each time hoping that the situation ,Public
  I call it fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants foreign policy and it is no ,Public
way to advance American interests and values on the global stage.,Public
  But beyond that beyond the way this administration has acted it is ,Public
not the job of Congress to give any administration its blind trust. It ,Public
is why we have separation of powers. It is why the Constitution ,Public
  Let me say that again. It is why the Constitution entrusts war powers ,Public
to Congress. We haven't had a declared war in this country since World ,Public
  So it is a relief that both the administration and the Iranians have ,Public
for the moment opted to de-escalate. But we would be foolish to think ,Public
this crisis is over. It could flame up again in the blink of an eye ,Public
and I worry that another misstep on either side could be what plunges ,Public
our country into another ill-advised war in the Middle East.,Public
  I will say it very plainly: The American people do not want war with ,Public
Iran. With the measure before us today we are denying the President ,Public
  This would direct the President to terminate the use of armed force ,Public
against Iran without congressional authorization unless it is necessary ,Public
to respond to an imminent armed attack against the United States.,Public
  The President always has the power to defend America. No one denies ,Public
that. This resolution explicitly preserves this right but that is a ,Public
limited exception. The President shouldn't abuse it.,Public
  Now we have heard the argument that the 2002 Authorization for the ,Public
Use of Military Force the Iraq war authorization would justify ,Public
military action against Iran. That is just wrong. It is not what ,Public
Congress intended when it passed that resolution. I was here. I ,Public
remember it. It should be repealed not used to launch more military ,Public
  If the President wants to use military force against Iran he has to ,Public
come to Congress. Any President has to come to Congress. We are not ,Public
making rules only for this President. We are making rules for the ,Public
President any President vis-a-vis Congress' constitutional powers.,Public
  The President has to make the case first first not after he ,Public
launches an ill-advised attack then after the fact comes up with a ,Public
reason why it was necessary and why it was legal. That is not the way ,Public
  Today I have heard the myth floating around that this resolution is ,Public
nonbinding; that it is just symbolic. So let me quote from the War ,Public
  The War Powers law says: ``At any time that United States Armed ,Public
Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United ,Public
States its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or ,Public
specific statutory authorization such forces shall be removed by the ,Public
President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.'' Again ,Public
by concurrent resolution. That is what the War Powers Act states that ,Public
  This is the House of Representatives exercising its Article I ,Public
authority. We don't get authority over war powers just because--if the ,Public
President says so. We get authority over war powers period. That is ,Public
  And one final point Madam Speaker about the tone of this debate. ,Public
Yesterday a Member of this body went on television and said that ,Public
Democrats ``are in love with terrorists. They mourn Soleimani more than ,Public
  Another Member labeled a group of colleagues ``Ayatollah ,Public
  At a time when we are talking about policy that will have direct ,Public
bearing on American men and women servicemembers and diplomats in ,Public
harm's way comments like that reflect very poorly on this body. And I ,Public
remind the House that all Members in both parties regardless of ,Public
party love this country. These words have no place in this debate.,Public
  On the Foreign Affairs Committee we take pride in debating issues ,Public
even the toughest issues on the merits and on the facts. I salute my ,Public
friend the ranking member Mr. McCaul for working so closely with me ,Public
to make sure we do so. That is one of the keys of the Foreign Affairs ,Public
  I strongly encourage all Members on both sides to bear that in mind ,Public
during this debate. We all take the same oath. We can argue about this ,Public
resolution without questioning one another's motives or one another's ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  When President Obama took down Osama Bin Laden the Rean ,Public
Members joined with Democrats as Americans to praise the President. ,Public
Unfortunately today Democrats are incapable of giving this President ,Public
credit where credit is due which only emboldens Iran.,Public
  I am surprised to be faced with this partisan resolution today. We ,Public
should be standing together as the chairman mentioned as a Nation. ,Public
Instead this resolution plays politics with national security.,Public
  Yesterday the President laid out a measured response to Iran's ,Public
ballistic missile attacks. Let me be clear. The President is not ,Public
seeking war with Iran. The President has shown if anything,Public
great restraint regarding Iran including after Iran's downing of a ,Public
  But in their blind contempt for the President my colleagues are ,Public
ignoring the assessments of career intelligence and military ,Public
  Our colleagues on the other side are downplaying the murderous evil ,Public
of Soleimani the mastermind of terror in the Middle East for over two ,Public
  Soleimani was designated as a terrorist by the Obama administration. ,Public
He was responsible for the deaths of more than 600 Americans and ,Public
  Soleimani was involved in the Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ,Public
Ambassador to the United States on American soil in Georgetown right ,Public
in this city. Soleimani oversaw Iran's support for Assad in Syria ,Public
including convincing Russia to fight for Assad killing hundreds of ,Public
thousands. This year Soleimani played a key role in the crackdown on ,Public
protestors in Iraq that killed hundreds of Iraqis.,Public
  It should be clear to any reasonable person that Soleimani posed a ,Public
long-term threat to the United States and to innocent civilians in the ,Public
Middle East and across the globe. We don't need to get into classified ,Public
  According to the Department of Defense in the last 2 months ,Public
Soleimani and his proxies launched 12 attacks against U.S. forces and ,Public
facilities in Iraq. On December 27 Soleimani's Iranian proxies killed ,Public
an American and injured four U.S. servicemembers near Kirkuk. On ,Public
Dec-31 Soleimani's Iranian proxies launched an assault on the ,Public
  But Soleimani was not done. Secretary Pompeo said that Soleimani was ,Public
``actively plotting'' to take ``big action'' that would ``put dozens if ,Public
not hundreds of American lives at risk'' which DOD said targeted ,Public
American diplomats and servicemembers in Iraq and throughout the ,Public
  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Milley said that the ,Public
administration would have been ``culpably negligent'' given the ,Public
evidence and intelligence they had had they not acted.,Public
  The President possessed the legal authority for this strike and ,Public
complied with his obligation to report it to Congress within 48 hours ,Public
under the War Powers Resolution. The President has inherent Article II ,Public
authority as Commander in Chief to defend United States personnel from ,Public
attacks that Soleimani was carrying out and plotting against Americans. ,Public
  This is not just a partisan analysis. Jeh Johnson President Obama's ,Public
general counsel at the Department of Defense and former Secretary of ,Public
Homeland Security approved the airstrikes during the Obama ,Public
administration. He stated that Soleimani ``was a lawful military ,Public
objective and the President under his constitutional authority as ,Public
Commander in Chief had ample domestic legal authority to take him out ,Public
without an additional congressional authorization.'' That was President ,Public
  As a second authority the National Security Adviser cited the 2002 ,Public
AUMF that authorized the use of force ``to defend the national security ,Public
of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.'' ,Public
That authorization has been used previously to address terrorist ,Public
threats to U.S. personnel inside Iraq including by President Obama to ,Public
  The dangerously partisan reactions to last week's strike in defense ,Public
of Americans are even more apparent when compared to Democratic ,Public
reactions to Obama's thousands of unauthorized airstrikes in defense of ,Public
  Back in June 2011 then-Leader Pelosi was asked about the Obama ,Public
administration's months of airstrikes inside Libya dropping hundreds ,Public
of millions of dollars in U.S. munitions without congressional ,Public
authorization. Leader Pelosi was asked: ``Madam Leader you are saying ,Public
that the President did not need authorization initially and still does ,Public
not need any authorization from Congress on Libya?'' Her answer was ,Public
  She said: ``I believe the limited nature of this engagement allows ,Public
the President to go forward. . . . I am satisfied that the President ,Public
  That logic should apply far more in the strike against Soleimani to ,Public
  I am pleased the administration did not hesitate to take bold action ,Public
given the high threat level. Soleimani showed us through the embassy ,Public
attack and the attacks on U.S. forces that he was serious about hurting ,Public
  Our intelligence community saw his next plan coming together and our ,Public
military under direction from our Commander in Chief acted. They saw ,Public
  I thank the President and the men and women of our intelligence ,Public
community and the military for upholding their responsibility to ,Public
protect American lives. Instead of supporting the President ,Public
unfortunately my Democratic colleagues are dividing Americans at a ,Public
critical time weakening our leverage overseas and emboldening our ,Public
enemy the largest state sponsor of terror in the world.,Public
  I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution which seeks to tie the ,Public
President's hands as he continues to defend Americans in the Middle ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from ,Public
Michigan (Ms. Slotkin) the author of this important resolution.,Public
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker I rise today in support of my bill a War ,Public
Powers Resolution that states that the President of the United States ,Public
must consult Congress before going to war with Iran. This is simply ,Public
  For me this is not a theoretical exercise. My husband spent 30 years ,Public
in the Army and retired as a colonel. We actually met on my third tour ,Public
in Iraq when I was a CIA officer. My stepdaughter is a brand-new Army ,Public
officer. My son-in-law's unit is stationed at Al Asad Air Base which ,Public
was just targeted by ballistic missiles this week.,Public
  If our loved ones are going to be sent to fight in any protracted ,Public
war the President owes the American  a conversation. The ,Public
resolution we will be voting on today allows us to start that debate ,Public
  Let me be clear: The Government of Iran is a leading state sponsor of ,Public
terrorism and engages in a range of destabilizing activities across the ,Public
Middle East. I have experienced these personally as a former CIA ,Public
analyst. I served multiple tours in Iraq three tours. My specialty is ,Public
  I have followed Iran's destabilizing activity in Iraq up close for my ,Public
entire professional career. I have watched friends and colleagues hurt ,Public
or killed by Iranian rockets mortars and explosive devices. Iranian ,Public
General Qasem Soleimani was the lead architect of much of Iran's ,Public
destabilizing activities in the Middle East and throughout the world.,Public
  To that end with Iran or with any other adversary the United States ,Public
always has the inherent right and obligation to self-defense against ,Public
imminent armed attacks--always. The United States always maintains the ,Public
right and the responsibility to ensure the safety of our diplomatic ,Public
  When it comes to the matter of longer term war either as something ,Public
that we choose as a Nation or as something that we find ourselves in ,Public
as Members of this body we have a constitutional responsibility to ,Public
  The Framers of our Constitution rightly believed that the power to ,Public
declare war belongs in the Congress because this would ensure that the ,Public
American people through the legislators they elected weigh the most ,Public
  To this end the resolution does a few simple things.,Public
  First it states that the President does not currently have ,Public
authorization for war against Iran which his own Secretary of Defense ,Public
acknowledged in a congressional hearing last month.,Public
  Second it requires the President to get congressional authorization ,Public
if he wants to conduct a protracted war with Iran.,Public
  Third it makes clear that the President maintains the authority to ,Public
use force to prevent imminent attacks against the United States or our ,Public
in national security it is extremely important to me that this ,Public
resolution in no way ties the President's hands or takes away any ,Public
capabilities from our military commanders to respond in self-defense ,Public
  We have been at war for nearly two decades which has spanned both ,Public
Rean and Democratic administrations as my colleague pointed out. ,Public
In that time Congress has voted only twice to authorize the use of ,Public
  Congress has long abdicated its responsibility as laid out in the ,Public
Constitution to make the hard decisions we owe our troops when it comes ,Public
to authorizing war. We owe it to our military and to ourselves as a ,Public
Nation to open this conversation on the authorization of military ,Public
force to provide our troops that clarity and to abide by the ,Public
  I urge my colleagues Reans and Democrats to support this ,Public
resolution. I know it is a political time but my attempt was to hew ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ,Public
California (Mr. McCarthy) the distinguished Rean leader.,Public
  Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding.,Public
  The United States and our allies are safer with Qasem Soleimani gone. ,Public
President Trump's decisive leadership was justified and it was right.,Public
  Soleimani had the blood of over 600 American servicemembers on his ,Public
hands. For more than 20 years he attacked our troops established a ,Public
brutal reign of terror across the Middle East and was directly ,Public
responsible for the death of thousands of innocent civilians including ,Public
in his own country. And he had more terror planned.,Public
  As President Trump said this strike was done to prevent a war not ,Public
start one. In yesterday's address he was true to his word. He was ,Public
confident and restrained. Even as he underscored our strength and ,Public
resolve he extended the people of Iran our hand in peace and ,Public
friendship. President Trump's decision to embrace the Reagan doctrine ,Public
of peace through strength in dealing with Iran has worked.,Public
  Those who criticize President Trump for Iran's dangerous foreign ,Public
policy should actually spend a few moments to review their history. It ,Public
is Iran that is responsible for escalating tensions by creating chaos ,Public
  In the decades since 1979's revolution Iran has become the number ,Public
one state sponsor of terrorism in the world. More recently it shot ,Public
down an American military drone and seized a British oil tanker.,Public
  On December 27 Iranian proxies crossed the line by killing an ,Public
American. For the first time since 1988 we have an administration ,Public
willing to strike back. From most of the media reports many may know ,Public
him only as an unnamed U.S. contractor killed in Iraq but he was more ,Public
than that. His name was Nawres Hamid. He was a husband. He was the ,Public
father of two young sons. He was a resident of California.,Public
  Before Nawres became a citizen he was valiantly serving alongside ,Public
our troops as a linguist. All of our hearts break for his wife and ,Public
  There are some in this Chamber who seem to be downplaying his death ,Public
but his death matters. It matters to his family. It matters to his ,Public
countrymen. It matters to the President. It matters to me. His death ,Public
was unnecessary unprovoked and it deserved justice.,Public
  That is why my next statement carries even more meaning. Red lines ,Public
should mean something. In this administration they do. Killing Nawres ,Public
was a red line. Planning to kill Americans is a red line.,Public
  I am confident that the right decision was to take out the man ,Public
responsible for Nawres' death and the death of hundreds of other ,Public
  Iran responded earlier this week by sending missiles to U.S. bases in ,Public
Iraq. I believe we are all relieved and grateful that there were no ,Public
American casualties. Iran appears to be pulling back from its strategy ,Public
of provocation in the face of firm American determination. Iran seems ,Public
to understand that deescalation is right for them and the world.,Public
  Now is the time for our country to come together and speak with one ,Public
voice not as Reans not as Democrats but as Americans.,Public
  Instead of working with this administration to continue to work ,Public
toward shared goals Democrats are using this moment to continue their ,Public
  As my colleague and former CIA officer Will Hurd said he never ,Public
thought he would see the day that the Iranian Government would be able ,Public
to manipulate Members of Congress Democratic Presidential candidates ,Public
and the Western media yet here we are on this floor today.,Public
  If President Trump's instinct is to put America first his critics' ,Public
  The words of my Democratic colleagues including the Speaker of the ,Public
House blame the United States for attacks Iran has been initiating for ,Public
the past four decades. Now they want to limit the President's ability ,Public
  I want to clear up some news Madam Speaker that I actually even ,Public
recently heard on this floor. I would probably consider it fake news ,Public
  Contrary to their claim the resolution before the House today is ,Public
nonbinding. It is called a concurrent resolution. This resolution if ,Public
passed won't go to the President's desk for signature. It won't have ,Public
  Madam Speaker I heard the chairman try to claim that this had power. ,Public
I know we have three coequal branches of government.,Public
  Madam Speaker I think the chairman should actually look at what the ,Public
Supreme Court ruled in the Chadha case that concurrent resolutions are ,Public
unconstitutional as a means to limit the executive branch. I think I ,Public
  In fact the Supreme Court ruled in the Chadha case that concurrent ,Public
resolutions are unconstitutional as a means to limit the executive ,Public
branch. The purpose of a concurrent resolution is to deal with mundane ,Public
  Now I want everybody to know and understand what we have used ,Public
concurrent resolutions for--it is very important: to authorize the use ,Public
of the Capitol Grounds for the Soap Box Derby to use the rotunda to ,Public
present a congressional medal to Jack Nicklaus and to host a birthday ,Public
party in the Capitol Visitor Center. But the new majority decided to ,Public
  For a party that wants to claim they care about the Constitution ,Public
Madam Speaker Democrats may want to brush up on their facts. If they ,Public
did they would realize their actions today are shameful and ,Public
embarrassing even by the low standards they set in their impeachment ,Public
  They seem to have forgotten that we are not the House of Resolutions. ,Public
We are actually the U.S. House of Representatives. Our job isn't to ,Public
debate feelings. Our job isn't to make recommendations. We are ,Public
  But that is not how we are spending our time today. This resolution ,Public
has as much force of law as a new year's resolution. It is nothing more ,Public
than a press release to appease their socialist base.,Public
  What message is it sending to Iran? That we are strong determined ,Public
and united as a country or that we are divided shortsighted and ,Public
  Madam Speaker ``In war resolution'' and ``in peace goodwill.'' ,Public
Winston Churchill wrote those words after he led Britain to victory in ,Public
the Second World War. They describe what he believed were the right ,Public
actions for great leaders to take at history's defining moment.,Public
  We should keep Churchill's words in mind today. President Trump ,Public
clearly has. Because of President Trump's leadership the United States ,Public
and our allies are safer today than we were exactly 1 week ago.,Public
  Petty politics are wrong for the country especially now. Not liking ,Public
President Trump is not an excuse for failing to see that the President ,Public
and his administration have a sensible and deeply American strategy for ,Public
  Madam Speaker I imagine we will continue to hear from other ,Public
Democrats defending Iran for their escalation and the death of an ,Public
American. Madam Speaker I imagine that the Democrats will try to claim ,Public
a concurrent resolution is more than a Soap Box Derby but the Supreme ,Public
  Madam Speaker I imagine I will hear a lot from the Democrats today. ,Public
I would like to hear a Democrat speak to the 600 Gold Star families ,Public
whose loved ones were killed by Soleimani. I would like to hear them ,Public
  I would like to hear them defend Iran and their actions of burning an ,Public
embassy of killing an American of killing thousands of civilians even ,Public
in their own country. But they are going to take our time today with ,Public
  Yes they will run to the mikes. They will get on TV. They will tell ,Public
a little more fake news that it meant something today.,Public
  The only thing that will happen today is it will make Iran believe ,Public
they are stronger. It will make Iran believe they have allies in the ,Public
  Madam Speaker in light of the information that we have coming out of ,Public
Iran if it is true of why an airliner was shot down if that was the ,Public
case I would like to see a Democrat move to the floor and pull this ,Public
concurrent resolution. If it means nothing else I think we should have ,Public
  I look forward to listening Madam Speaker to any Democrat who wants ,Public
to speak to the Gold Star families about why they want to have a debate ,Public
today and tell them that ``Soleimani is bad but.'' It is not ``but''; ,Public
it is ``because'' because he killed Americans because he killed ,Public
thousands of civilians. That is why he was taken out and the world is ,Public
  Madam Speaker I look forward to hearing the defense from the other ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I am sorry that the Rean leader is ,Public
casting aspersions. I think everyone on both sides of the aisle takes ,Public
this seriously and has reasons for what we are voting on.,Public
  Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from ,Public
California (Mr. Khanna) a gentleman who has been very involved in ,Public
these issues for a long long time and has been a real leader in these ,Public
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker I thank Chairman Engel for yielding and ,Public
  I rise today not as a partisan but as someone concerned about ,Public
  We have worked across the aisle with people like Representative ,Public
Meadows and others to stop our country from getting into endless wars. ,Public
There is not one party that wants to stop these wars; this is in our ,Public
  Now let's be very clear. Soleimani had blood on his hands. Soleimani ,Public
was a bad actor. Soleimani killed Americans. That is not the debate.,Public
  The debate is whether America should get into another war in the ,Public
Middle East or whether we should be focused on our real competition ,Public
  We are 21 percent of the world's GDP. China our competition for the ,Public
21st century is 15 percent. Iran is 0.44 percent of GDP.,Public
  China hasn't been in a war since 1979. We are in 40 conflicts.,Public
  Future historians will ask why we were so obsessed with a region the ,Public
Middle East with 3.5 percent of GDP when we should have been focused ,Public
on investing in our country to build the future to win the 21st ,Public
  I don't think staying out of bad wars that cost this country ,Public
trillions of dollars is a Democratic issue or a Rean issue. ,Public
  I know Leader McCarthy says this is a formality. Under the War Powers ,Public
Act you are supposed to have a concurrent resolution.,Public
  My hope is the President will agree with this and not get us into a ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 15 seconds to the ,Public
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker I appreciate the gentleman yielding.,Public
  I will make my final point. This shouldn't be partisan.,Public
  Here is what I would love to see that the President says in the ,Public
future action he is not going to get into a war and that he agrees ,Public
with the concurrent resolution that this body passes.,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker I rise today in opposition to this ,Public
resolution which curtails the President's authority to protect ,Public
  Two weeks ago Iranian proxies launched a missile attack on American ,Public
forces in Iraq. This was the 11th such rocket attack by the Iranians in ,Public
recent months. This time as our leader said it killed Nawres Hamid ,Public
who was a husband a father a contractor and an American citizen.,Public
  The man behind this attack and additional attacks that were being ,Public
planned and that were imminent was the terrorist mastermind Qasem ,Public
Soleimani who was responsible for the deaths as we have heard of at ,Public
least 600 probably many more Americans and for thousands of others in ,Public
that part of the world and for causing destabilization throughout the ,Public
  For years now Soleimani had been leading Iran's shadow war against ,Public
us and against our allies. In targeting Soleimani President Trump took ,Public
bold long-overdue action and he ought to be supported for this ,Public
  This resolution by condemning even limited military force and ,Public
limited action would essentially tie the President's hands behind his ,Public
back as he tries to counter Iran's shadow campaign against us.,Public
  Madam Speaker it makes no sense this resolution and I strongly ,Public
urge my colleagues to oppose it and vote against it.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from ,Public
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker America is not safe or safer because ,Public
of the acts that occurred local time on January 32020,Public
  America is in more jeopardy as are our brave men and women in the ,Public
United States military whom we hold in the highest esteem and say to ,Public
their families: We are obligated and committed to honoring and thanking ,Public
you but to also recognizing when we send you into battle there would ,Public
and should be the consultation the engagement the understanding of ,Public
the intelligence and the work between Article I the United States ,Public
Congress and Article II the President of the United States.,Public
  I will not allow any Member of Congress to malign my Gold Star ,Public
families or to suggest that any Member here does not respect the ,Public
ultimate sacrifice that their family members took. Family members who ,Public
are Gold Star should not be used in a political debate. They should ,Public
  And I will not accept anyone describing Democrats as mourning ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 15 seconds to the ,Public
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker what I will say is that nothing in ,Public
this resolution speaks to any named person. It says that this body ,Public
this Congress must adhere to its duty to be able to ensure that the ,Public
President of the United States does not unilaterally take us into war ,Public
  It does as well say that my resolution in 2002 indicated that we ,Public
  Madam Speaker as a senior member of the House Committees on the ,Public
Judiciary and on Homeland Security as a member serving in this body on ,Public
Sep-11 2001 and throughout the fateful and tragic war in Iraq ,Public
and as an original cosponsor I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. ,Public
83 a concurrent resolution directing the President to terminate the ,Public
engagement of United States Armed Forces in hostilities in or against ,Public
  l thank the gentlelady from Michigan Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin ,Public
for introducing this resolution and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair ,Public
Eliot Engel for his work on this important resolution.,Public
  I also thank Speaker Pelosi for taking swift action to afford the ,Public
House the opportunity to honor its constitutional duty to keep the ,Public
American people safe by limiting the President from taking further ,Public
  We know from bitter and heart-breaking experience the truth that ,Public
while dangerous and bloody battles are fought by the military it is ,Public
  And that is why the Framers lodged the awesome power to declare and ,Public
take the nation to war not in the hands of a single individual but ,Public
in the collective judgment of Congress the representatives of the ,Public
  It is true of course that the United States has an inherent right to ,Public
self-defense against imminent armed attacks and that it maintains the ,Public
right to ensure the safety of diplomatic personnel serving abroad.,Public
  But in matters of imminent armed attacks the executive branch must ,Public
inform Congress as to why military action was necessary within a ,Public
certain window of opportunity the possible harm that missing the ,Public
window would cause and why the action was likely to prevent future ,Public
  Only after being fully briefed and informed is the Congress in a ,Public
position to validate and ratify or disapprove and terminate the action.,Public
  Madam Speaker Section 5(c) of the 1973 War Power Resolution Pub. L. ,Public
93-148 provides that whenever ``United States Armed Forces are engaged ,Public
in hostilities outside the territory of the United States its ,Public
possessions and territories without a declaration of war or specific ,Public
statutory authorization such forces shall be removed by the President ,Public
if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.'',Public
  The military action ordered on Friday January 32020 local time by ,Public
the President to kill Major General Qasem Soleimani the head of Iran's ,Public
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may have rid the world of a major ,Public
architect of terror but leaves unanswered the critically important ,Public
question of why the action was taken at that time.,Public
  Even at this late hour members of Congress have not been briefed or ,Public
been shown compelling evidence by the Administration that the action ,Public
was necessary to repel a credible certain and imminent attack on the ,Public
United States its allies or American civilians or military personnel.,Public
  The Administration has yet to provide proof or assuage the concerns ,Public
of most member of Congress and of the American people that the ,Public
killing of Major General Soleimani was a necessary action that was the ,Public
product of a carefully crafted geopolitical strategy developed after ,Public
extensive discussion within the national security apparatus regarding ,Public
the short and long-term consequences for the security of the region and ,Public
  Similarly we do not know whether the decision to engage in the ,Public
hostile action against Iran was made by the President in consultation ,Public
and agreement with our regional and international allies and whether ,Public
there is now in place a strategy to ensure that the action taken does ,Public
not lead to a greater escalation of tensions between Iran and the ,Public
United States or in the worst case another war in the Middle East ,Public
placing at risk the lives and safety of millions of persons.,Public
  Madam Speaker Major General Soleimani was the long-time chief of the ,Public
Quds Force the elite special forces battalion of the Islamic ,Public
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) assisted Syrian strongman Bashar al ,Public
Assad slaughter hundreds of thousands of his own people in the Syrian ,Public
civil war helped incite the Houthis in Yemen's civil war and oversaw ,Public
the brutal killing of hundreds of Iraqi protesters recently ,Public
demonstrating against Iranian influence in their country.,Public
  Iran's Quds Force under Soleimani's leadership has long been ,Public
suspected by the U.S. Government of involvement in a 2011 plot to ,Public
assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States and bore ,Public
responsibility for the deaths of more than 600 Americans killed by ,Public
Iranian proxies since the 2003 inception of the war in Iraq.,Public
  Over the past eight months in response to rising tensions with Iran ,Public
the United States has introduced over 15000 additional forces into the ,Public
  But Major General Soleimani was more than a military leader he was a ,Public
high-ranking political leader second only in power and influence to ,Public
  In fact Soleimani was regarded by many as a future president of ,Public
  It was foreseeable therefore that the killing of Soleimani by ,Public
American forces was likely to invite retaliation by Iran putting at ,Public
risk American military and civilian personnel as well as its allies in ,Public
  It must be remembered that the United States has national interests ,Public
in preserving its partnership with Iraq and other countries in the ,Public
region including by combating terrorists including the Islamic State ,Public
of Iraq and Syria (ISIS); preventing Iran from achieving a nuclear ,Public
weapons capability; and supporting the people of Iraq Iran and other ,Public
countries throughout the Middle East who demand an end to government ,Public
  For these reasons it is essential that the Administration have in ,Public
place a sound well-considered and meticulously developed strategy for ,Public
  There is no evidence that the Administration consulted with Congress ,Public
or the Gang of 8 no evidence that it enlisted or even consulted our ,Public
allies in NATO or the region no evidence that the Administration has a ,Public
working and well-functioning national security council apparatus.,Public
  This is a critical Pottery Barn failure in dealing with the Middle ,Public
East for as former Secretary of State Colin Powell stated before the ,Public
  Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed that a ``harsh ,Public
retaliation is waiting'' for the United States as a consequence of the ,Public
  It is imperative that the Administration have in place a strategy to ,Public
counter and deescalate any Iranian response and have in place measure ,Public
to protect the safety of Americans residing or travelling abroad and to ,Public
  The deliberate and targeted killing of Major General Soleimani has ,Public
the potential to be the most consequential assassination of a political ,Public
leader since World War I was started by the assassination of Archduke ,Public
Franz Ferdinand Carl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria the heir ,Public
presumptive of the throne of Austria-Hungary in 1914.,Public
  One of the enduring lessons of the Great War too often forgotten but ,Public
so well documented in Barbara Tuchman's prize-winning history ``The ,Public
Guns of August'' is that misconceptions miscalculations and mistakes ,Public
result in the tragedy of horrific warfare; among them are ,Public
overestimating the value of one's economic power harboring an ill-,Public
founded belief in quick victory and a failure to consider political ,Public
  Madam Speaker the decision to send American men and women into ,Public
harm's way is the most consequential decision the Constitution vests in ,Public
  Members of Congress must be apprised of all facts material to the ,Public
decision and have access to relevant documentation classified and ,Public
otherwise and afforded the opportunity to meet in small groups and in ,Public
secure locations with senior members of the Administration's national ,Public
security team who can answer detailed and pointed questions and provide ,Public
  The Constitution wisely divides the responsibility of deciding when ,Public
to use military force to protect the Nation and its interests between ,Public
the President and the Congress the representatives of the American ,Public
  The United States' military involvement in Iraq begun in March 2003 ,Public
and continuing to this day has taught this Nation the importance of ,Public
having accurate and reliable information when deciding whether to use ,Public
military force and the painful costs in lives and treasure of acting ,Public
  That is why I am proud to support and cosponsor H. Con. Res. 83 the ,Public
concurrent resolution before us which directs the President to ,Public
terminate immediately the use of United States Armed Forces to engage ,Public
in hostilities in or against Iran or any part of its government or ,Public
military unless Congress has declared war or enacted specific ,Public
statutory authorization for such use of the Armed Forces; or the use of ,Public

imminent armed attack upon the United States its territories or ,Public

  Our constituents all Americans across the country and the people of ,Public
the globe are looking to us to ensure that tensions between the United ,Public
States and Iran are deescalated that smart power and diplomacy be ,Public
employed and every effort be made to ensure the peace and safety in ,Public

  Madam Speaker today our Nation is debating the very profound ,Public
question of war and peace and the structure and nature of international ,Public
relations in the 21st century. Before us today is the serious and ,Public
fundamental question of life and death: whether or not this Congress ,Public
will give the President authority to commit this Nation to war.,Public
  Always a question of the greatest importance our decision today is ,Public
further weighted by the fact that we are being asked to sanction a new ,Public
foreign policy doctrine that gives the President the power to launch a ,Public
unilateral and preemptive first strike against Iraq before we have ,Public
  My amendment provides an option and the time to pursue it. Its goal ,Public
is to give the United Nations inspections process a chance to work. It ,Public
provides an option short of war with the objective of protecting the ,Public
American people and the world from any threat posed by Iraqi weapons of ,Public
  The amendment urges the United States to reengage the diplomatic ,Public
process and it stresses our government's commitment to eliminating any ,Public
Iraqi weapons of mass destruction through United Nations inspections ,Public
  It emphasizes the potentially dangerous and disastrous long-term ,Public
consequences for the United States of codifying the President's ,Public
  The administration's resolution forecloses alternatives to war before ,Public
  We do not need to rush to war and we should not rush to war. If what ,Public
we are worried about is the defense of the United States and its ,Public
  If the United States truly faced an imminent attack from anywhere ,Public
the President has all of the authority in the world to ensure our ,Public
defense based on the Constitution the War Powers Act and the United ,Public
  Our own intelligence agencies report that there is currently little ,Public
chance of chemical and biological attack from Saddam Hussein on U.S. ,Public
forces or territories. But they emphasize that an attack could become ,Public
much more likely if Iraq believes that it is about to be attacked. This ,Public
is a frightening and dangerous potential consequence that requires ,Public
  President Bush's doctrine of preemption violates international law ,Public
the United Nations Charter and our own long-term security interests. It ,Public
will set a precedent that could come back to haunt us.,Public
  Do we want to see our claim to preemption echoed by other countries ,Public
maintaining that they perceive similar threats? India or Pakistan? ,Public
  I would submit that we would have little moral authority to urge ,Public
other countries to resist launching preemptive strikes themselves. This ,Public
approach threatens to destabilize the Middle East unleash new forces ,Public
of terrorism and instability and completely derail any prospects for ,Public
  Unilateralism is not the answer. Iraqi weapons of mass destruction ,Public
are a problem to the world community and we must confront it and we ,Public
should do so through the United Nations. Multilateralism and steadfast ,Public
commitment to international law should be the guiding principle as we ,Public
  As I said the purpose of my amendment is to let the United Nations ,Public
do its work. Let us give inspections and other containment mechanisms a ,Public
chance to succeed once again. Inspections did make real progress in ,Public
eliminating weapons of mass destruction in the 1990s despite Saddam ,Public
Hussein's best effort at obstruction and deceit. U.N. inspectors ,Public
destroyed large stockpiles of chemical weapons missiles and weapons of ,Public
mass destruction. We can and should renew and expand this process. In ,Public
addition to inspections we should improve border monitoring through an ,Public
enhanced containment system to prevent shipments of nuclear materials ,Public
or other weapons to Iraq. And we should install surveillance technology ,Public
  As part of enhanced containment we should work with the countries ,Public
bordering Iraq and with regional seaports to ensure that United Nations ,Public
Security Council resolutions are enforced and we should plug holes in ,Public
the current arms embargo blanket. We should also work on ,Public
nonproliferation efforts globally to secure weapons materials.,Public
  All of these are diplomatic options that we can and should undertake ,Public
  What we are doing today is building the framework for 21st century ,Public
international relations. It will either be a framework of unilateralism ,Public
and insecurity or multilateral cooperation and security. It is our ,Public
  During the Cold War the words ``first strike'' filled us with fear. ,Public
  I am really appalled that a democracy our democracy is ,Public
contemplating taking such a fearsome step and really setting such a ,Public
terrible international precedent that could be devastating for global ,Public
  We are contemplating sending our young men and women to war where ,Public
they will be doing the killing and the dying. And we as ,Public
representatives of the American people have no idea where this action ,Public
will take us where it will end and what price we will pay in terms of ,Public
lives and resources. This too should cause us to pause. We have ,Public
choices however and we have an obligation to pursue them to give ,Public
U.N. inspections and enhanced containment a chance to work. What this ,Public
resolution does state very clearly and firmly is that the United States ,Public
will work to disarm Iraq through United Nations inspections and other ,Public
diplomatic tools. It states that we reject the doctrine of preemption ,Public
and it reaffirms our commitment to our own security and national ,Public
interests through multilateral diplomacy not unilateral attack.,Public
  I urge you to protect our national interests by giving the United ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker this week universally ,Public
respected Senator Joe Lieberman a Democrat provided an extraordinary ,Public
op-ed in The Wall Street Journal: ``President Trump's order to take out ,Public
Qasem Soleimani was morally constitutionally and strategically ,Public
correct. . . . No American can dispute that Soleimani created ,Public
supported and directed a network of terrorist organizations that ,Public
spread havoc in the Middle East.'' In Syria ``more than 5000,Public
  ``During the Iraq war Soleimani oversaw three camps in Iran.'' These ,Public
trained fighters have killed more than 600 American soldiers.,Public
  The claim that President Trump ``had no authority to order this ,Public
attack without congressional approval is constitutionally untenable and ,Public
practically senseless. . . . Democrats should leave partisan politics ,Public
at `the water's edge' and . . . stand together against Iran and ,Public
  Senator Joe Lieberman tells the truth. We must resist: ``Death to ,Public
  I extend our sympathies to the family of Nawres Hamid an Iraqi ,Public
American Muslim from California who was murdered by Soleimani-financed ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ,Public
Virginia (Mr. Connolly) a valuable member of the Foreign Affairs ,Public
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 83 ,Public
directing the President to cease military hostilities against Iran.,Public
  Last week President Trump ordered a provocative and disproportionate ,Public
drone strike killing Quds Force commander Major General Qasem ,Public
  Soleimani was a malign actor who masterminded the killings of many ,Public
U.S. soldiers but assassinating him has unleashed the dogs of war. ,Public
Iran launched a dozen ballistic missiles against two U.S. military ,Public
bases in Iraq and we must be prepared for further Iranian retaliation.,Public
  These threats stem from the President's fateful and reckless decision ,Public
to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal a deal that was working by ,Public
every measure leaving us with no leverage and Iran with nothing to ,Public
  We don't need another war. Peace demands action now. That is why ,Public
Congress must reassert its solemn constitutional duty under Article I ,Public
to decide when and where the United States goes to war. This resolution ,Public
  Madam Speaker on Tuesday night Iran launched at least a dozen ,Public
ballistic missiles against two U.S. military bases in Iraq.,Public
  Thankfully there were no American casualties but I remain concerned ,Public
  These attacks come after President Trump ordered a drone strike that ,Public
assassinated Iranian Quds Force commander Major General Qasem ,Public
  Soleimani was a bad actor and masterminded the killings of many U.S. ,Public
soldiers in Iraq and Lebanon. He will not be missed.,Public
  But killing Soleimani was supposed to make us safer. In reality the ,Public
  What is unfolding now is the result of the Trump Administration's ,Public
incoherent foreign policy stemming from its fateful and reckless ,Public
decision to withdraw the United States from our own agreement the Iran ,Public
  By all accounts prior to our withdrawal Iran was in compliance with ,Public
  It was only after our withdrawal and re-imposition of sanctions ,Public
lifted under the agreement that Iran began to exceed its stockpile of ,Public
low-enriched uranium and then resume uranium enrichment.,Public
  Following the Soleimani strike Iran has vowed to ignore all ,Public
restrictions set by the nuclear deal. This move has set in motion the ,Public
very thing we were seeking to avoid--a nuclear-armed Iran.,Public
  Our abrogation of the Iran nuclear agreement leaves us with no ,Public
  Iran and its proxy forces have engaged in a series of retaliatory ,Public
actions: attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf downing an ,Public
American drone in international waters cruise missile attacks against ,Public
Saudi oil plants and rocket attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq.,Public
  Secretary of State Pompeo claimed ``The world is a much safer place ,Public
and I can assure you Americans in the region are much safer after the ,Public
  And yet in the wake of Soleimani's killing the State Department has ,Public
urged Americans to leave Iraq immediately whether by air or by land ,Public
  Two years ago I warned that we were sleepwalking into an armed ,Public
conflict. That the hidden scandal of the Iraq War--the manipulation of ,Public
outcome--was now an overt political strategy to undermine the Iran ,Public
  I fear now that these steps have brought us to the brink of war with ,Public
  According to Pompeo ``this was an intelligence-based assessment that ,Public
  Yet when asked about the imminent threat facing Americans from ,Public
Soleimani Pompeo pointed to a previous attack in Iraq that killed an ,Public
American contractor and injured four servicemembers not a new ,Public
  Yesterday the Trump Administration offered a sophomoric and utterly ,Public
unconvincing briefing to members of Congress on the strike's rationale.,Public
  President Trump's decision to assassinate Soleimani was provocative ,Public
and disproportionate and has endangered American lives and the security ,Public
  We don't need another war. Peace demands action now.,Public
  That is why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority to ,Public
decide when and where the United States goes to war.,Public
  Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution states that ,Public
``Congress shall have power . . . to declare war . . . and to raise and ,Public
  And today the House of Representatives will make clear that Congress ,Public
has not authorized President Trump to go to war with Iran.,Public
  Neither the 2001 nor the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military ,Public
Force (AUMF) authorize the President to attack Iran or its senior ,Public
  I urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to support this ,Public
war powers resolution and reclaim our solemn constitutional duty to ,Public
determine when the United States puts our uniformed men and women in ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
  Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman from Texas.,Public
  This resolution is insincere and unserious. If my colleagues on the ,Public
other side really want to limit the President's ability to defend the ,Public
United States then they ought to take the vote and limit him and stand ,Public
  Now if you are not familiar with terrorist Soleimani let me just ,Public
  His reign of terror for Americans started with 241 marines in Beirut ,Public
Lebanon. He and his organization continued on to the Khobar Towers ,Public
hundreds and hundreds of Americans dead by IEDs and thousands maimed. A ,Public
servicemember from Pennsylvania incinerated--incinerated--in the ,Public
  The President does not desire war with Iran or anyone else but Iran ,Public
  I have got a news flash for everybody: They have been at war with the ,Public
United States since they punched us in the face in 1979.,Public
  Washington has been appeasing Iran and the policy of appeasement has ,Public
542 that is the number of drone attacks under the Obama ,Public
administration in places like Yemen Somalia Pakistan.,Public
  Oh by the way not the theatre of war for the United States. Not a ,Public
peep Madam Speaker not a peep from the other side.,Public
  The terrorist state of Iran cannot continue killing Americans and ,Public
cannot have a nuclear bomb. Madam Speaker it is time to stand up for ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ,Public
California (Mr. Sherman) a longtime valued member of the House Foreign ,Public
  Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker this resolution imposes extraordinary ,Public
restrictions on this President an extraordinary President who needs ,Public
  This is best exemplified by the President's gratuitous comment that ,Public
he would hit cultural sites in Iran. Not only is that a war crime but ,Public
it is a mistake because it drives the Iranian people toward the regime ,Public
while alienating our European allies whose support for our sanctions is ,Public
  The minority leader came to this floor and said Democrats were dupes ,Public
of the Islamic Re. I will compare my record of efforts against ,Public
the Islamic Re of Iran with those of any other Member.,Public
  You could argue whether Soleimani's death makes us safer or not over ,Public
the next few months. We have removed a terrorist mastermind from the ,Public
battlefield but we have inspired the other terrorists.,Public
  The real issue is the effect on Iran's program. That program is more ,Public
robust today than it was a week ago as Iran has employed more ,Public
centrifuges and is building a larger stockpile all without our ,Public
European friends who are still in the JCPOA taking any action against ,Public
  There was no policy process on the golf course where the President ,Public
made this decision. He heard not from a single expert on Iranian ,Public
  Our maximum pressure campaign is designed to put such pressure on the ,Public
Iranian people that they choose not to endure it but demand that the ,Public
nuclear program be scaled back or ended or that the regime that has ,Public
  This assassination undercuts that effort by building support for the ,Public
regime and its nuclear program with most of the Iranian people by ,Public
making Soleimani a martyr in front of a Shiite population a Shiite ,Public

from New York (Mr. Zeldin) a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.,Public
  Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker I rise in strong opposition to this ,Public
resolution. I rise in total support of the decision to remove Qasem ,Public
  I have heard the use of the word ``disproportionate'' from the ,Public
Speaker. I have heard it here today on the House floor and it is just ,Public
a shocking word to be used to describe what took place. It makes me ask ,Public
the question: At what point is it proportionate to take out a ,Public
designated terrorist who kills 600 U.S. troops wounds thousands of ,Public
others kills and wounds troops recently and his proxies attack a U.S. ,Public
  If anyone has any doubt as to what Qasem Soleimani was doing in Iraq ,Public
at the time we took him out you can look at the IRGC's own words. The ,Public
IRGC put out a statement saying that Soleimani and companions were on ,Public

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President in March the Senate narrowly passed a ,Public
resolution that would have misused the War Powers Act and actually ,Public
hampered efforts to bring the conflict in Yemen to a close. ,Public
  So today Members will have a second chance to send the right message ,Public
to our partners in the region to important humanitarian missions and ,Public
to eradicating al-Qaida from the Arabian Peninsula. I urge my ,Public
colleagues to vote to uphold the President's veto.,Public
  The resolution before us starts from false premises. We are not ,Public
parties to the civil war in Yemen. We are no longer providing even air-,Public
  More important the resolution would make it actually more difficult ,Public
to prevent the loss of innocent lives. This resolution would require ,Public
U.S. advisers to cease training and intelligence sharing operations ,Public
that help pilots avoid civilian casualties. And it would dry up U.S. ,Public
noncombat support to the weakened U.N.-recognized government in Yemen.,Public
  The resolution would also create serious new problems for the U.N.-,Public
led diplomatic mission that is doing all it can to negotiate an end to ,Public
  Abandoning our Yemeni Emirati and Saudi partners just as diplomatic ,Public
efforts are starting to make progress is hardly the way to give them ,Public
the confidence to take the hard diplomatic steps that are necessary.,Public

news for Iran for the Houthi rebels they support and of course al-,Public
  I share many of my colleagues' serious concerns about aspects of ,Public
Saudi Arabia's behavior but the best way for us to encourage better ,Public
behavior from our partners is to remain involved with Saudi Arabia and ,Public
the UAE not push them into the arms of Russia and China.,Public
  The War Powers Act is a blunt tool and not at all the right vehicle ,Public

  Madam Speaker the question before us today is very simple: Should ,Public
President Trump be allowed to send the United States hurtling toward ,Public
war with Iran without prior congressional approval?,Public
  It is a question we must wrestle with following the President's ,Public
actions last Thursday. That is when he ordered the lethal drone attack ,Public
on Iraqi soil that killed Iranian General Soleimani. The outgoing Prime ,Public
Minister has said the strike was carried out without Iraqi permission ,Public
or knowledge. It was done without any plan for the consequences in the ,Public
region or the world. And more troubling still it was carried out ,Public
without any input from the people's Representatives here in Congress.,Public
  Madam Speaker just a month ago Iran was staring down some of the ,Public
most intense antigovernment protests in a decade. Thousands took to the ,Public
streets of Tehran to express growing frustration and anger with their ,Public
  But what a difference a month makes. Protestors--men women and ,Public
children--have again taken to the streets of Tehran. Only this time ,Public
their anger wasn't directed at their own leaders; it was directed at ,Public
the United States of America--all because of the President's unilateral ,Public
  Madam Speaker that is what happens when monumental decisions of war ,Public
and peace are made in a vacuum with no regard for the consequences. ,Public
  Rather than protect our national security and stabilize the region ,Public
President Trump's reckless decision to strike Soleimani united Iran. It ,Public
has led to retaliatory strikes on two bases used by U.S. and coalition ,Public
forces in Iraq and it has put our troops and diplomats serving ,Public
  Now make no mistake: This decision has endangered all Americans ,Public
everywhere. Hardliners are emboldened; 4000 more U.S. troops have been ,Public
deployed to the region; operations against ISIS have been suspended; ,Public
the Iraqi Parliament has voted to kick American troops out of Iraq--all ,Public
because of the brash decision of one man: the President of the United ,Public
  Madam Speaker there was no question that Soleimani was a ruthless ,Public
military commander. He had American Syrian Lebanese Iraqi and ,Public
Yemeni blood on his hands. But that is not up for debate today nor is ,Public
the question of whether or not killing him was a good or bad idea.,Public
  The President of the United States assassinated a high-level foreign ,Public
military commander without asking or even notifying Congress ,Public
  Madam Speaker with little evidence the President claims his actions ,Public
prevented an imminent threat but the American people have heard that ,Public
one before. We remember the stories about weapons of mass destruction ,Public
in Iraq. We remember the tens of thousands of American soldiers who ,Public
  Madam Speaker is this Congress going to sit by and allow that to ,Public
happen in Iran or are we going to ensure that this body acts before a ,Public
war begins that could continue long after President Trump leaves ,Public
  Now the Constitution is clear; it is crystal clear. Article I ,Public
Section 8 gives Congress the power to declare war but President Trump ,Public
treated Congress as if it were an afterthought in a decision that has ,Public
  More than 4000 of our brave men and women are now being sent to the ,Public
Persian Gulf all without any input from the people's Chamber.,Public
  We represent the brave young men and women who are deploying to ,Public
Kuwait; we represent those deploying to Iraq; and we represent those ,Public
deploying elsewhere across the Middle East. Each of us speaks for them ,Public
and we speak for their families who are scared sick as their loved ,Public
  Madam Speaker we must summon the courage to be their voice.,Public
  Now I am glad that the United States and Iran have taken a step back ,Public
from the brink of war but what we heard from the President yesterday ,Public
was more of the same bluster. It is clear even after the briefing by ,Public
the administration yesterday that many of us attended that he has no ,Public
  Now make no mistake: The world is less safe because of Trump's ,Public
chaotic foreign policy. The impacts of his strikes are still ,Public
reverberating in the region and across the world and we cannot sit ,Public
  The Constitution makes the President Commander in Chief but it gives ,Public
only Congress the power to declare war. The Founders knew that ,Public
decisions of this magnitude required consultation between the branches ,Public
House no matter who controls the majority on Capitol Hill.,Public
  Our Democrats don't want war with Iran; most Reans don't want ,Public
war with Iran; and the American people certainly don't want a war with ,Public
Iran. I think that would be catastrophic. We should be stopping costly ,Public
  But whatever you believe have the courage of your conviction have ,Public
the courage to vote and that is what the underlying War Powers ,Public
Resolution is all about. Congress needs to authorize any additional ,Public
  Madam Speaker these decisions aren't easy. I understand that. There ,Public
is no more consequential vote than deciding whether to send men and ,Public
women off to war and into harm's way. We weigh that decision knowing ,Public
that despite our hopes and prayers lives are lost in combat.,Public
  Mothers and fathers could lose their children. Kids could be forced ,Public
  But when we were sworn in each of us took an oath to defend the ,Public
Constitution and that means wrestling with this very tough decision ,Public
when necessary. The only question now is whether we have the guts to ,Public
  Madam Speaker with the Middle East held captive to the whims of a ,Public
reckless President and with the Commander in Chief without a clue I ,Public
  On behalf of our troops their families and the American people I ,Public
urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying resolution.,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may ,Public
  I thank Mr. McGovern for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.,Public
  Today we consider H. Con. Res. 83 or technically we are ,Public
considering the rule to consider H. Con. Res. 83 a resolution to ,Public
remove the United States Armed Forces from hostilities in Iran.,Public
  But the thing is we are not engaged in hostilities in Iran. Once ,Public
again we are considering a measure that will have no force of law. ,Public
  There was some debate in the Rules Committee last night on whether a ,Public
concurrent resolution under the War Powers Resolution is in fact ,Public
nonbinding. But in the Senate a joint resolution has been introduced ,Public
making it likely that this House Concurrent Resolution will go no ,Public
  The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war. The ,Public
Constitution also designates the President as the Commander in Chief of ,Public
the Armed Forces. This sets up a conflict. The courts have not ,Public
delineated the boundaries of these authorities or determined gaps ,Public
between them that would either deny power to a President or to the ,Public
  In Federalist Number 69 Alexander Hamilton argued the President's ,Public
power resides only in the direction of the military as placed by law at ,Public
his command. Presidents have long argued that their role as Commander ,Public
in Chief coupled with their inherent authority over foreign affairs ,Public
grants them the power to engage the Armed Forces short of war as they ,Public
  Since the founding of our country the Supreme Court has ruled both ,Public
that the President enjoys greater discretion when acting with respect ,Public
to matters of foreign affairs and that absent an authorization of ,Public
action during wartime any action by the President was void.,Public
  Despite the struggle to maintain the separation of powers with regard ,Public
to engaging our Armed Forces the motivation underlying the inclusion ,Public
in the Constitution of these powers for both the President and the ,Public
Congress continues to this day: The desire to protect and defend the ,Public
  Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973 largely in ,Public
response to the experiences in Korea and Vietnam. The War Powers ,Public
Resolution authorizes the engagement of the forces of the United States ,Public
in hostilities when: There is a declaration of war; or there exists a ,Public
specific statutory authorization; or a national emergency created by ,Public
attack upon the United States its territories or possessions or its ,Public
  To assess the current situation let's examine what has led us to ,Public
  In June of 2019 Iran shot down a surveillance aircraft that was ,Public
flying over international waters near the Strait of Hormuz. This was an ,Public
  At the time President Trump was advised by his military advisers to ,Public
strike back but the President opted not to strike back because it ,Public
would have resulted in Iranian casualties and he felt he could not ,Public
justify creation of human casualties because of the loss of a machine. ,Public
I agree with the President in that decision. I think his restraint was ,Public
  In September of 2019 Iranian cruise missiles struck nearly 20 ,Public
targets of critical energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. This ,Public
disrupted a significant portion of Saudi oil production.,Public
  In December of 2019 Iranian-backed forces in Iraq targeted military ,Public
facilities where United States forces were co-located.,Public
  On December 27 an Iranian-backed Hezbollah group a U.S.-designated ,Public
foreign terrorist organization attacked a base in northern Iraq and ,Public
they killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four U.S. servicemembers.,Public
  The United States responded and it launched a retaliatory air strike ,Public
  On January 2 2020 acting on intelligence of imminent threat to ,Public
American interests and in response to the persistent attack by ,Public
Iranian-backed entities the United States military killed General ,Public
Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was the long-time leader of the Iran ,Public
  The Iran Revolutionary Guard is a U.S.-designated terrorist ,Public
organization. It has been supporting proxy forces throughout the Middle ,Public
East and attacking United States interests and allies for over a ,Public
  Soleimani previously operated under strict security but in recent ,Public
years he has moved much more freely and openly believing that the ,Public
United States did not have the willpower to be able to attack him. His ,Public
atrocities include the deaths of hundreds of Americans and the ,Public
attempted assassination of a Saudi diplomat in the United States among ,Public
  President Obama's former Secretary of Homeland Security Secretary ,Public
Jeh Johnson stated that General Soleimani was a legitimate military ,Public
  I do want to be clear. The last thing that I want to see and I ,Public
suspect anyone in this body wants to see is our men and women committed ,Public
to another conflict in the Middle East. We want those conflicts to end ,Public
  But Madam Speaker today the world is a safer place without General ,Public
  Despite the disagreement in how further to engage in the Middle East ,Public
in the country of Iran be it militarily or diplomatically the last ,Public
thing we should be doing is broadcasting our plans to the enemy.,Public
  By passing this War Powers Resolution directing the President to ,Public
remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities with Iran a point ,Public
that is in itself in contention we are effectively telling the ,Public
Iranian mullahs that it is okay to push forward with their aggressive ,Public
posturing. Rather than stating what the President cannot do perhaps we ,Public
  Last night in the Rules Committee it became clear that both ,Public
Reans and Democrats agree that the world is a safer place without ,Public
General Soleimani and any war with Iran needs to be authorized by ,Public
  Democrats want to maintain the separation of powers as do I but the ,Public
question is to what extent are we jeopardizing our safety?,Public
  I believe Congress does need to authorize military action and ,Public
maintain the separation of powers as intended by the Founders but we ,Public
  While we may be divided on the need for this resolution let us ,Public
recognize the privilege that we enjoy each and every day being able to ,Public
stand in this House and debate these issues without fear of,Public
retribution of our government. Those protesters in Iran did not enjoy ,Public
that freedom. They cut off the internet and eliminated those ,Public
protesters. That is why you don't see them anymore.,Public
  Madam Speaker I urge opposition to this rule and I reserve the ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may ,Public
  Let me just respond to the gentleman when he says that this is a ,Public
concurrent resolution here in the House and it is nonbinding and merely ,Public
symbolic. Let me point out to him that the law states clearly that this ,Public
sort of resolution reins in the President. The War Powers Resolution ,Public
requires the President to stop using American forces and hostilities if ,Public
  Moreover the Constitution gives war powers to the Congress not to ,Public
the President. And if both Houses pass this resolution it is a clear ,Public
statement that Congress is denying the President the authority to wage ,Public
war and that the President must come to Congress for an authorization ,Public
  And by the way we are not just pursuing a concurrent resolution. ,Public
Senator Kaine of Virginia over in the Senate is pursuing a joint ,Public
resolution; so we are covering all bases here because we are deeply ,Public
concerned that we may end up in a war inadvertently here and that ,Public
  Again I would urge the gentleman to read the War Powers Resolution. ,Public
I have a copy here and the accompanying report when this resolution ,Public
was signed into law. The report with regard to consultation is ,Public
crystal clear that consultation is meant prior to introducing our ,Public
forces and engaging into hostilities which is something the President ,Public
  And in terms of the President's exercising this remarkable restraint ,Public
I just have a very different opinion. Have you read his Twitter ,Public
account? Have you been listening to him on TV as he brags about the ,Public
shiny expensive weapons we have that he would love to use? The ,Public
rhetoric the threat to bomb cultural sites which is a war crime? I ,Public
mean the gentleman may be totally at ease with all of that but I am ,Public
not; and most of the American people are scared as hell of this ,Public
President's rhetoric when it comes to a potential war with Iran.,Public
  All we are saying here is that we ought to stand up for this ,Public
institution and stand with the Constitution and make it very clear ,Public
that if the President wants to go to war in Iran that he needs to come ,Public
to Congress to get that declaration to get that authorization.,Public
  Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ,Public
  Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker I rise in strong support of the War ,Public
Powers Resolution to limit the President's military actions regarding ,Public
  As a Member of Congress one of our most sacred votes is our vote to ,Public
declare war. We therefore have an obligation to study the evidence ,Public
and share concerns about the administration's decision to engage in ,Public
hostilities against Iran. We have a duty to question its strategy or ,Public
  My expertise Madam Speaker is not foreign policy but I know Iran. ,Public
I lived there. I worked there as a Peace Corps volunteer many years ,Public
ago. I have been a student of Iranian history and politics for more ,Public
  There is no question about Iran's role in sponsoring terrorism. ,Public
Soleimani himself was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of ,Public
Americans and thousands around the world. He actively worked to foment ,Public
instability across the Middle East on behalf of the government of Iran.,Public
  Nevertheless the President of the United States in his response to ,Public
Iran announced that he would commit a war crime by targeting Iran's ,Public
extraordinary cultural sites. War crimes. No matter who is President of ,Public
the United States when he or she indicates that they are prepared to ,Public
commit a war crime then Congress better step up and reassert its ,Public
  We must demand that the President justify any act and that is what ,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker let me yield myself 30 seconds for the ,Public
  And my response would be had the gentleman from Massachusetts ,Public
yielded to me for a question my question was going to be was he ,Public
asking for unanimous consent to change the concurrent resolution to a ,Public
joint resolution such that it could align and harmonize with the Senate ,Public
activity and then therefore maybe accomplish something. But he ,Public
  Madam Speaker I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. ,Public
  Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker I want to thank my good friend Dr. Burgess ,Public
  I rise Madam Speaker in reluctant opposition quite frankly to ,Public
  As my good friend Chairman McGovern knows we have actually worked ,Public
together to try and expand and reclaim war-making authority for the ,Public
Congress of the United States and I would offer and continue to work ,Public
with him in that partnership. I think that is something that needs to ,Public
  I also think we have no difference that if we were to engage in a war ,Public
with Iraq it would require congressional authorization. And frankly ,Public
last night in the Rules Committee I offered a process whereby we ,Public
could work together in a bipartisan fashion; that is let's just follow ,Public
the War Powers Resolution. Let's submit something to the committee of ,Public
jurisdiction which is actually the Foreign Affairs Committee. We have ,Public
a deadline or a timeline laid out in the War Powers Act; they could ,Public
operate within that. Within a matter of a few weeks we would then in a ,Public
very bipartisan manner bring something to the floor.,Public
  Let's contrast that with how this particular resolution came to the ,Public
floor. We got it about 45 minutes before the Rules Committee meeting. ,Public
It is written in the Speaker's Office; rewritten in the Speaker's ,Public
Office and it is sent down here to make a political point not to ,Public
actually do something that would substantively restore congressional ,Public
war-making power. This is all politics; that is all it is.,Public
  The political aim here is for our friends to suggest that the ,Public
President either wants war with Iran or has acted hastily ,Public
precipitously and recklessly. Neither of those things is true.,Public
  Frankly our latest dispute with Iran begins with the decision by ,Public
this administration appropriately to withdraw from the very ill-advised ,Public
Iranian nuclear deal a deal by the way that the majority of this ,Public
House and the majority of the United States Senate opposed but ,Public
  What has been the Iranian response to our withdrawal? A series of ,Public
provocations to which as my good friend Mr. Burgess pointed out the ,Public
President by and large has acted with remarkable restraint. Let's ,Public
  First it was attacks on ships in the Strait of Hormuz in the gulf. ,Public
What was the President's response? Well let's organize an ,Public
international flotilla to defend these ships. He did not attack Iran.,Public
  Next as my good friend from Texas pointed out we see strikes into ,Public
Iraq itself. Particularly we see an attack on Saudi Arabian oil ,Public
refineries. What is the President's response? Well let's not attack ,Public
Iran. Let's send defensive capabilities from our country there and ,Public
  Then we see attacks on American forces in Iraq. What is the ,Public
President's response? As my friend pointed out let's go after the Shia ,Public
  Finally after that when the President responds we see another ,Public
attack. In that attack as my friend pointed out an American ,Public
contractor died and four American servicemembers were wounded. Again ,Public
  Then the next response our embassy is assaulted. Thank goodness no ,Public
loss of life but I think the President had had enough.,Public
  By the way just after that assault happens who magically shows up ,Public
in violation of a U.N. resolution in Iraq? Our good friend General ,Public
Soleimani a designated terrorist for 13 years a person who has killed ,Public
hundreds of Americans wounded thousands more not to,Public
mention the tens of thousands across the region. What does the ,Public
President do? The President takes out a legitimate terrorist target. In ,Public
Iran? No the President doesn't want to do that. He does it in Iraq.,Public
  Now how anybody could have any doubt about the President's desire ,Public
to number one strike at a terrorist and number two avoid war I ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 1 minute to the ,Public
  Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker passing this resolution as my good friend ,Public
Dr. Burgess suggested sends the wrong message to the wrong people at ,Public
  The President did the right thing here. He has acted in a restrained ,Public
manner. He has endured and our country has endured endless ,Public
  We should reject this rule. Frankly we should have a regular process ,Public
where we actually go back to the committee of jurisdiction. We should ,Public
  Before I conclude I want to mention I know my friend is very sincere ,Public
in his opinions on expanding congressional war power. There is no doubt ,Public
in my mind about it. We have worked on that before. I look forward to ,Public
working with my friend on that issue again. This is the wrong vehicle ,Public
the wrong place the wrong time the wrong consequences for our own ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker let me say to the gentleman from ,Public
Oklahoma that I look forward to working with him on the war powers and ,Public
other issues related to the executive branch encroaching on legislative ,Public
powers in the future. I hope we can work in a bipartisan way and make ,Public

 As Tensions With Iran Escalated Trump Opted for Most Extreme Measure,Public
     (By Helene Cooper Eric Schmitt Maggie Haberman and Rukmini ,Public
       Washington.--In the chaotic days leading to the death of ,Public
     Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani Iran's most powerful commander ,Public
     top American military officials put the option of killing ,Public
     him--which they viewed as the most extreme response to recent ,Public
     Iranian-led violence in Iraq--on the menu they presented to ,Public
       They didn't think he would take it. In the wars waged since ,Public
     the Sept. 11 2001 attacks Pentagon officials have often ,Public
     offered improbable options to presidents to make other ,Public
       After initially rejecting the Suleimani option on Dec. 28 ,Public
     and authorizing airstrikes on an Iranian-backed Shiite ,Public
     militia group instead a few days later Mr. Trump watched ,Public
     fuming as television reports showed Iranian-backed attacks ,Public
     on the American Embassy in Baghdad according to Defense ,Public
       By late Thursday the president had gone for the extreme ,Public
       Mr. Trump made the decision senior officials said on ,Public
     Saturday despite disputes in the administration about the ,Public
     significance of what some officials said was a new stream of ,Public
     intelligence that warned of threats to American embassies ,Public
     consulates and military personnel in Syria Iraq and Lebanon. ,Public
     General Suleimani had just completed a tour of his forces in ,Public
     Syria Lebanon and Iraq and was planning an ``imminent'' ,Public
     attack that could claim hundreds of lives those officials ,Public
       ``Days weeks'' Gen. Mark A. Milley the chairman of the ,Public
     Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Friday when asked how ,Public
     imminent any attacks could be without offering more detail ,Public
     other than to say that new information about unspecified ,Public
       But some officials voiced private skepticism about the ,Public
     rationale for a strike on General Suleimani who was ,Public
     responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops ,Public
     over the years. According to one United States official the ,Public
     new intelligence indicated ``a normal Monday in the Middle ,Public
     East''--Dec. 30--and General Suleimani's travels amounted to ,Public
       That official described the intelligence as thin and said ,Public
     that General Suleimani's attack was not imminent because of ,Public
     communications the United States had between Iran's supreme ,Public
     leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and General Suleimani showing ,Public
     that the ayatollah had not yet approved any plans by the ,Public
     general for an attack. The ayatollah according to the ,Public
     communications had asked General Suleimani to come to Tehran ,Public
     for further discussions at least a week before his death.,Public
       Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike ,Public
     Pence were two of the most hawkish voices arguing for a ,Public
     response to Iranian aggression according to administration ,Public
     officials. Mr. Pence's office helped run herd on meetings and ,Public
     conference calls held by officials in the run-up to the ,Public
       Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and General Milley declined ,Public
     spokeswoman Col. DeDe Halfhill said without elaborating ,Public
     that ``some of the characterizations being asserted by other ,Public
     sources are false'' and that she would not discuss ,Public
     conversations between General Milley and the president.,Public
       The fallout from Mr. Trump's targeted killing is now ,Public
     underway. On Saturday in Iraq the American military was on ,Public
     alert as tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters marched ,Public
     through the streets of Baghdad and calls accelerated to eject ,Public
     the United States from the country. United States Central ,Public
     Command which oversees American military operations in the ,Public
     Middle East said there were two rocket attacks near Iraqi ,Public
     bases that host American troops but no one was injured.,Public
       In Iran the ayatollah vowed ``forceful revenge'' as the ,Public
       In Palm Beach Fla. Mr. Trump lashed back promising to ,Public
     strike 52 sites across Iran--representing the number of ,Public
     American hostages taken by Iran in 1979--if Iran attacked ,Public
     Americans or American interests. On Saturday night Mr. Trump ,Public
     warned on Twitter that some sites were ``at a very high level ,Public
     & important to Iran & the Iranian culture and those targets ,Public
     and Iran itself WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.'',Public
       The president issued those warnings after American spy ,Public
     agencies on Saturday detected that Iranian ballistic missile ,Public
     units across the country had gone to a heightened state of ,Public
     readiness a United States official said on Saturday night.,Public
       Other officials said it was unclear whether Iran was ,Public
     dispersing its ballistic missile units--the heart of the ,Public
     Iranian military--to avoid American attack or was mobilizing ,Public
     the units for a major strike against American targets or ,Public
     allies in the region in retaliation for General Suleimani' s ,Public
       On Capitol Hill Democrats voiced growing suspicions about ,Public
     the intelligence that led to the killing. At the White House ,Public
     officials formally notified Congress of a war powers ,Public
     resolution with what the administration said was a legal ,Public
     largest rapid deployments in decades are bound for the ,Public
       General Suleimani who was considered the most important ,Public
     person in Iran after Ayatollah Khamenei was a commanding ,Public
     general of a sovereign government. The last time the United ,Public
     States killed a major military leader in a foreign country ,Public
     was during World War II when the American military shot down ,Public
     the plane carrying the Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.,Public
       But administration officials are playing down General ,Public
     Suleimani's status as a part of the Iranian state suggesting ,Public
     his title gave him cover for terrorist activities. In the ,Public
     days since his death they have sought to describe the strike ,Public
     as more in line with the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the ,Public
     Islamic State leader who died in October in an American ,Public
       Administration officials insisted they did not anticipate ,Public
     sweeping retaliation from Iran in part because of divisions ,Public
     in the Iranian leadership. But Mr. Trump's two predecessors--,Public
       General Suleimani had been in Mr. Trump's sights since the ,Public
     beginning of the administration although it was a Dec. 27 ,Public
     rocket attack on an Iraqi military base outside Kirkuk which ,Public
     left an American civilian contractor dead that set the ,Public
       General Milley and Mr. Esper traveled on Sunday to Mar-a-,Public
     Lago Mr. Trump's Palm Beach resort a day after officials ,Public
     presented the president with an initial list of options for ,Public
     how to deal with escalating violence against American targets ,Public
       The options included strikes on Iranian ships or missile ,Public
     facilities or against Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq. ,Public
     The Pentagon also tacked on the choice of targeting General ,Public
     Suleimani mainly to make other options seem reasonable.,Public
       Mr. Trump chose strikes against militia groups. On Sunday ,Public
     the Pentagon announced that airstrikes approved by the ,Public
     president had struck three locations in Iraq and two in Syria ,Public
       Jonathan Hoffman the chief Pentagon spokesman said the ,Public
     targets included weapons storage facilities and command posts ,Public
     used to attack American and partner forces. About two dozen ,Public
       ``These were on remote sites'' General Milley told ,Public
     reporters on Friday in his Pentagon office. ``There was no ,Public
       But the Iranians viewed the strikes as out of proportion to ,Public
     their attack on the Iraqi base and Iraqis largely member's ,Public
     of Iranian-backed militias staged violent protests outside ,Public
     the American Embassy in Baghdad. Mr. Trump who aides said ,Public
     had on his mind the specter of the 2012 attacks on the ,Public
     American compound in Benghazi Libya became increasingly ,Public
     angry as he watched television images of pro-Iranian ,Public
     demonstrators storming the embassy. Aides said he worried ,Public
     that no response would look weak after repeated threats by ,Public
       When Mr. Trump chose the option of killing General ,Public
     Suleimani top military officials flabbergasted were ,Public
     alarmed about the prospect of Iranian retaliatory strikes on ,Public
     American troops in the region. It is unclear if General ,Public
     Milley or Mr. Esper pushed back on the president's decision.,Public
     Operations Command looked for an opportunity to hit General ,Public
     Suleimani who operated in the open and was treated like a ,Public
     celebrity in many places he visited in the Middle East. ,Public
     Military and intelligence officials said the strike drew on ,Public
     information from secret informants electronic intercepts ,Public
     reconnaissance aircraft and other surveillance tools.,Public
       The option that was eventually approved depended on who ,Public
     would greet General Suleimani at his expected arrival on ,Public
     Friday at Baghdad International Airport. If he was met by ,Public
     Iraqi government officials allied with Americans one ,Public
     American official said the strike would be called off. But ,Public
     the official said it was a ``clean party'' meaning members ,Public
     of Kataib Hezbollah including its leader Abu Mahdi al-,Public

  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ,Public
New York (Mr. Morelle) a member of the Rules Committee.,Public
  Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker I thank the distinguished chair and my ,Public
colleague from the Rules Committee Mr. McGovern for yielding me this ,Public
  We begin the new year in turbulent and uncertain times particularly ,Public
with regard to Iran and the Middle East. Protecting our national ,Public
interests and securing the safety and security of the American people ,Public
must be the highest priorities of our government. I am gravely ,Public
concerned the recent actions of the Trump administration have ,Public
destabilized the region and undermined those priorities.,Public
  Article I of the United States Constitution vests in the House and ,Public
Senate the responsibility to declare war to appropriate money for the ,Public
national defense and in doing so to ensure no President employs ,Public
military action without careful consultation of and authorization by ,Public
  That is why it is so important that we take action to reaffirm these ,Public
responsibilities by passing the resolution before us which I am proud ,Public
  The use of United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities ,Public
against Iran must come only after thoughtful deliberation and approval ,Public
by Congress. As we move forward we must all seek to achieve a peaceful ,Public
resolution that protects American interests at home and abroad.,Public
  I join with all Americans in praying for the safety of our courageous ,Public
servicemembers and urge my colleagues to support this rule and the ,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from ,Public
Arizona (Mrs. Lesko) a valuable member of the House Committee on ,Public
  Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding.,Public
  First I thank President Trump for making a decisive action to ,Public
  The world now knows that Obama's appeasement strategy policies ,Public
including giving billions of dollars to Iran are over. It didn't work. ,Public
The world knows that when President Trump says we are not going to ,Public
  In Rules Committee last night and again today I listened as my ,Public
Democratic colleagues claim what this resolution is all about. They ,Public
claim that it is about making sure Congress exerts its authority to ,Public
approve future war against Iran. But that is not what this resolution ,Public
  In fact let's read the title of this resolution. It says: ,Public
``Directing the President pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers ,Public
Resolution to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces to engage ,Public
in hostilities in or against Iran.'' It doesn't say anything about ,Public
  We do not currently have U.S. Armed Forces engaged in hostilities in ,Public
or against Iran. If Democrats are serious about making sure Congress ,Public
has its say in declaring war they would follow the statutory ,Public
guidelines as described by Representative Cole. They are already in ,Public
  Instead Democrats have chosen to short circuit the process yet again ,Public
  As a member of the Rules Committee I saw the language of the ,Public
resolution 45 minutes before the Rules Committee started. This is not a ,Public
  Here are the facts. Iran and Iranian-backed militias have escalated ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 30 seconds to the ,Public
  Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker in June 2019 Iran shot down a U.S. drone. ,Public
Trump said no we are not going to retaliate because no U.S. lives ,Public
were lost. Iran attacked Saudi oil fields. Iran-backed militia killed a ,Public
U.S. citizen and wounded four troops. Then an Iran-backed militia ,Public
  Soleimani was a terrorist designated by the Obama administration.,Public
  Let me read very quickly what the Joint Chiefs of Staff have said. He ,Public
has had 40 years of military experience under all different ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again ,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 30 seconds to the ,Public
  Mrs. LESKO. General Milley said the trigger for the drone strike that ,Public
killed Soleimani was ``clear unambiguous intelligence indicating a ,Public
significant campaign of violence against the United States in the days ,Public
weeks and months'' and that the administration would have been ,Public
  This is a man who has been in the military for 40 years under ,Public
different administrations and you are going to doubt what he has to ,Public
  I thank President Trump for protecting American citizens.,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I include in the Record a January 8 ,Public
Vanity Fair article entitled ``There Is No Strategy: Diplomats React to ,Public
     ``There Is No Strategy'': Diplomats React to Trump's Erratic ,Public
       After the American drone strike and Iran's measured ,Public
     retaliation some State vets worry that Trump is a wild card ,Public
     the biggest danger: ``From a political standpoint'' says ,Public
     one ``they have behaved a hell of a lot more rationally and ,Public
       In the aftermath of Iran's strike against two airbases in ,Public
     retaliation for the drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani ,Public
     last week a sigh of relief was breathed but for what? That ,Public
     there had been no casualties from Iran's cruise missiles was ,Public
     a huge reason to be thankful. (U.S. officials have since ,Public
     suggested this was intentional.) But there was also a sense ,Public
     of relief that Trump had stepped back--as if he were the wild ,Public
     card. The developments laid bare what diplomats I spoke with ,Public
     identified as a discomforting reality in the Trump era. ``Up ,Public
     is down and down is up'' a former U.S. ambassador in the ,Public
     region told me noting Iran's decision to notify the Iraqis ,Public
     ahead of the attack on Tuesday and Mohammad Javad Zarif's ,Public
     message of detente in the face of Trump's bluster. ``Who ,Public
     would've imagined that it's the American president who is a ,Public
     crazy person gunning for war and the mullahs who are being ,Public
     careful and deliberate and cautious . . . . They have done ,Public
     terrible things--I am not going to defend the fact that the ,Public
     country holds hostages and has absolutely supported terrorist ,Public
     groups and those sorts of things--but from a political ,Public
     standpoint they have behaved a hell of a lot more rationally ,Public
     and predictably than we have'' this person added. ``Do you ,Public
     take comfort in the fact that Iran is the rational actor or ,Public
     does that scare the bejesus out of you even more?'',Public
       A former Foreign Service Officer who worked on Iran under ,Public
     Barack Obama echoed the point. ``I think it is interesting ,Public
     that [Iran has taken] every opportunity to show that they're ,Public
     actually more responsible than the U.S. president in ,Public
     executing this conflict'' this person said. ``It boggles the ,Public
     mind to me that we are almost more concerned I think about ,Public
     our own president than we are about the way others may ,Public
       Diplomats I spoke with are clear-eyed in their belief that ,Public
     Iran's retaliation for Soleimani is not complete; they are ,Public
     bracing for--if not further military attacks--subsequent ,Public
     responses such as cyberattacks or even kidnappings. To a ,Public
     fault they too are not defending Iran's past malfeasance. ,Public
     And Trump's position on the wake of the attacks is welcomed ,Public
     ``President Trump made the right decision not to respond to ,Public
     Iran's missile attacks. There were no American casualties and ,Public
     the Iranians are clearly signaling they don't want a war'' ,Public
     Nicholas Burns the former ambassador to NATO told me. The ,Public
     problem is that Trump has thus far failed to chart a path ,Public
     forward with Iran. Instead he has shuttled between slamming ,Public
     Iran slighting his predecessor's signature Iran nuclear ,Public
     deal and patting himself on the back for the death of ,Public
     Soleimani and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the former leader of the ,Public
     Islamic State whom the United States killed in October. ``His ,Public
     speech was confusing about his strategy. It is not at all ,Public
     clear if he intends to contain Iran through deterrence or to ,Public
     weaken its government and seek regime change'' Burns added. ,Public
     ``He owes the American  the Congress and our allies a ,Public
     much more specific and consistent game plan. Otherwise it ,Public
     will be difficult for him to gain domestic and allied ,Public
       As I reported in the aftermath of the Soleimani's killing ,Public
     last week a chief concern within the diplomatic ranks was ,Public
     that the Trump administration still lacking a coherent ,Public
     foreign policy had failed to adequately contemplate and ,Public
     prepare for the international and Iranian response to the ,Public
     airstrike against the top Iranian general. Indeed the Trump ,Public
     administration certainly appeared to be caught flat-footed ,Public
     when the Iraqi parliament voted to expel U.S. troops from the ,Public
     country over the weekend. While asserting that the killing of ,Public
     Soleimani left Americans safer Secretary of State Mike ,Public
     Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper have yet to detail ,Public
     the imminent threat they claim the Iranian general posed to ,Public
     U.S. interests. And Trump's remarks on Wednesday arguably ,Public
     raised more questions than they answered. As the former ,Public
     ambassador in the region put it ``There is no strategy. It ,Public
     is satisfying Trump's ego at every step. It's all it is for ,Public
     us there is zero strategy and it's all strategy on Iran's ,Public
       Beyond his ``America First'' tagline Trump has failed to ,Public
     formulate anything resembling a coherent foreign policy. ,Public
     Rather he has a domestic policy that influences American ,Public
     posturing abroad. The clearest through line in Trump's ,Public
     various foreign policy decisions can largely be summed up as ,Public
     ``the opposite of what Obama did.'' But this lack of ,Public
     coherence is particularly troubling in the Middle East and is ,Public
     amplified by the reality that he's surrounded by hawks with ,Public
     hard-ons for toppling the Iranian regime like Pompeo. ``The ,Public
     most frustrating thing is that this is entirely of his own ,Public
     making. You think about where we were less than five years ,Public
     ago when we got to the deal. Things certainly weren't ,Public
     perfect by any means. They were still causing a lot of harm ,Public
     and doing things against our interests in the region but ,Public
     compare that to where we are today and it is so entirely ,Public
     avoidable'' the former Foreign Service officer told me. ,Public
     ``The lack of a strategy continues to be the most dangerous ,Public
       A former high-ranking State Department official expressed ,Public
     similar dismay. ``Foreign policy isn't well-done on impulse. ,Public
     Because so much is intertwined . . . . It requires the ,Public
     ability to understand the trade-offs and possible longer-term ,Public
     impacts. Never easy. But this team has no ability to do ,Public
     that'' they told me. ``If I were a military family member ,Public
     I'd really worry that our troops are being sent out with no ,Public
     clear plan or mission. Not a comforting thought.'',Public
       If Trump really does have an appetite for diplomacy that's ,Public
     undeniably a positive development. Diplomats stress that now ,Public
     is the time for it and the Iranians do seem to be signaling ,Public
     a desire deescalate. ``Now we're in the time of intense ,Public
     diplomacy where around the world leaders are figuring out ,Public
     `If you do this I do that' and 'What will be the response of ,Public
     X if we do Y' '' a former senior U.S. official told me. But ,Public
     this person added ``The only ones not taking part are the ,Public
     Americans.'' Instead ``America is content with a two-,Public
     dimensional policy: We take this act we stand still and ,Public
     watch what happens. The other countries are at least trying ,Public
     to be three-dimensional adding the element of time ,Public
     projecting to the not-too-distant future which advantages are ,Public
       In an ideal world Burns said Trump would open a reliable ,Public
     diplomatic channel to Tehran. ``We should want to be able to ,Public
     deliver tough and clear messages to its government. And it ,Public
     would be smart to offer Iran a diplomatic off-ramp so that we ,Public
     can end the possibility of a wider war that is in neither of ,Public
     our interests'' he said. ``Trump's disinterest in real ,Public
     diplomacy is a significant disadvantage for the U.S.'',Public
       Confronting a president who has repeatedly demonstrated a ,Public
     desire to dive into military conflict before diplomacy ,Public
     Congress is grappling with how to restrain Trump. California ,Public
     congressman Ro Khanna told me the attacks on Tuesday increase ,Public
     ``the urgency for Congress to act. We need to engage in de-,Public
     escalation and a cease-fire to end the cycle of violence.'' ,Public
     Currently on the table are a few measures House Democrats ,Public
     hope can curb Trump's authority to attack Iran. Among them ,Public
     are a War Powers Resolution and a bill drafted by Khanna and ,Public
     Senator Bernie Sanders that would defund any offensive action ,Public
     in Iran and require any such action to have Congressional ,Public
       Khanna told me that the Democratic caucus is unified and ,Public
     that he has been in talks with Speaker Nancy Pelosi about ,Public
     timing and process. The House is expected to vote on a War ,Public
     Powers Resolution after which they would push his bill with ,Public
     Senator Sanders. Currently House leadership is figuring how ,Public
     to craft a War Powers Resolution in a way that would prevent ,Public
     Reans from attaching a Motion to Recommit which could ,Public
     prevent it from reaching the Senate floor--as was the case ,Public
     with the War Powers Resolution on Yemen. ``That is why it is ,Public
     taking some time'' Khanna explained. ``It is taking time to ,Public
     figure out the procedural mechanisms with the parliamentarian ,Public
     in the House and the Senate so that what we send over to the ,Public
     Senate doesn't lose its War Powers privileged status. If it ,Public
     loses its privileged status then [Mitch] McConnell would ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may ,Public
consume to respond to the gentlewoman. I urge the gentlewoman who read ,Public
a couple of lines from the resolution as I urge all of my colleagues ,Public
  This is pretty simple. Basically it says that if we go to war with ,Public
Iran Congress ought to have a say in it. Congress ought to do what the ,Public
  I don't know why that is a radical idea but if my friends want to go ,Public
to war with Iran they have to have the guts to come to the floor to ,Public
  Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. ,Public
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker the President cannot unilaterally go ,Public
to war with Iran nor are we safer since January 22020 after having ,Public
targeted and killed the second-in-command of Iran. The American people ,Public
  In 2002 I was here and I offer these words from my statement on the ,Public
floor regarding President Bush. ``Always a question of the greatest ,Public
importance our decision today'' in 2002 ``is further weighted by the ,Public
fact that we are being asked to sanction a new foreign policy doctrine ,Public
that gives a President the power to launch a unilateral and preemptive ,Public
first strike against Iraq before we have utilized our diplomatic ,Public

that there is currently little chance of chemical and biological attack ,Public
from Saddam Hussein on U.S. forces or territories.'',Public

young men and women and many injured--this resolution and rule are ,Public

Summary of Information Regarding U.S. Counterterrorism Strikes Outside ,Public
       In accordance with the President's direction and consistent ,Public
     with the President's commitment to providing as much ,Public
     information as possible to the American people about U.S. ,Public
     counterterrorism activities the Director of National ,Public
     Intelligence (DNI) is releasing today a summary of ,Public
     information provided to the DNI about both the number of ,Public
     strikes taken by the U.S. Government against terrorist ,Public
     targets outside areas of active hostilities and the assessed ,Public
     number of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from ,Public
     those strikes. ``Areas of active hostilities'' currently ,Public

       The assessed range of non-combatant deaths provided to the ,Public
     DNI reflects consideration of credible reports of non-,Public
     combatant deaths drawn from all-source information including ,Public
     governmental organizations. The assessed range of non-,Public
     combatant deaths includes deaths for which there is an ,Public
     insufficient basis for assessing that the deceased is a ,Public
      U.S. Government Post-Strike Review Processes and Procedures,Public
       The information that was provided to the DNI regarding ,Public
     combatant and non-combatant deaths is the result of processes ,Public
     that include careful reviews of all strikes after they are ,Public
     conducted to assess the effectiveness of operations. These ,Public
     review processes have evolved over time to ensure that they ,Public
     incorporate the best available all-source intelligence media ,Public
     reassessments of strikes if new information becomes available ,Public
     that alters the original judgment. The large volume of pre- ,Public
     and post-strike data available to the U.S. Government can ,Public
     enable analysts to distinguish combatants from non-,Public
     combatants conduct detailed battle damage assessments and ,Public
     separate reliable reporting from terrorist propaganda or from ,Public
     media reports that may be based on inaccurate information.,Public
 Discrepancies Between U.S. Government and Non-Governmental Assessments,Public
     acknowledges that there are differences between U.S. ,Public
     Government assessments and reporting from non-governmental ,Public
     organizations. Reports from non-governmental organizations ,Public
     can include both aggregate data regarding non-combatant ,Public
     deaths as well as case studies addressing particular strikes ,Public
     and generally rely on a combination of media reporting and ,Public
     in some instances field research conducted in areas of ,Public
     reported strikes. Although these organizations' reports of ,Public
     non-combatant deaths resulting from U.S. strikes against ,Public
     terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities vary ,Public
     widely such reporting generally estimates significantly ,Public
     higher figures for non-combatant deaths than is indicated by ,Public
     U.S. Government information. For instance for the period ,Public
     governmental organizations' estimates range from more than ,Public
     200 to slightly more than 900 possible non-combatant deaths ,Public
       Consistent with the requirements applicable to future ,Public
     reporting under Section 3(b) of the Executive Order ``United ,Public
     States Policy on Pre- and Post-Strike Measures to Address ,Public
     Civilian Casualties in U.S. Operations Involving the Use of ,Public
     Force'' the information we are releasing today addresses ,Public
     general reasons for discrepancies between post-strike ,Public
     assessments from the United States Government and credible ,Public
     reporting from non-governmental organizations regarding non-,Public
     combatant deaths and does not address specific incidents. ,Public
     There are a number of possible reasons that these non-,Public
     governmental organizations' reports of the number of ,Public
     noncombatants killed may differ from the U.S. Government ,Public
     assessments based on the information provided to the DNI.,Public
     determining the precise number of combatant and non-combatant ,Public
     deaths particularly when operating in non-permissive ,Public
     methodologies that have been refined and honed over the years ,Public
     and that use information that is generally unavailable to ,Public
     non-governmental organizations. The U.S. Government draws on ,Public
     all available information (including sensitive intelligence) ,Public
     to determine whether an individual is part of a belligerent ,Public
     party fighting against the United States in an armed ,Public
     conflict taking a direct part in hostilities against the ,Public
     United States or otherwise targetable in the exercise of ,Public
     national self-defense. Thus the U.S. Government may have ,Public
     reliable information that certain individuals are combatants ,Public
     but are being counted as non-combatants by nongovernmental ,Public
     individual's possible membership in an organized armed group ,Public
     may include among other things: the extent to which an ,Public
     individual performs functions for the benefit of the group ,Public
     that are analogous to those traditionally performed by ,Public
     members of a country's armed forces; whether that person is ,Public
     carrying out or giving orders to others within the group; or ,Public
     whether that person has undertaken certain acts that reliably ,Public
       Second according to information provided to the DNI U.S. ,Public
     Government post-strike reviews involve the collection and ,Public
     analysis of multiple sources of intelligence before during ,Public
     and after a strike including video observations human ,Public
     sources and assets signals intelligence geospatial ,Public
     intelligence accounts from local officials on the ground ,Public
     and open source reporting. Information collected before a ,Public
     strike is intended to provide clarity regarding the number of ,Public
     individuals at a strike location as well as whether the ,Public
     individuals are engaged in terrorist activity. Post-strike ,Public
     collection frequently enables U.S. Government analysts to ,Public
     confirm among other things the number of individuals killed ,Public
     as well as their combatant status. The information is then ,Public
     analyzed along with other all-source intelligence reporting. ,Public
     This combination of sources is unique and can provide ,Public
     insights that are likely unavailable to non-governmental ,Public
       Finally non-governmental organizations' reports of ,Public
     counterterrorism strikes attributed to the U.S. Government--,Public
     particularly their identification of non-combatant deaths--,Public
     may be further complicated by the deliberate spread of ,Public
     organizations in local media reports on which some non-,Public
       Although the U.S. Government has access to a wide range of ,Public
     information the figures released today should be considered ,Public
     in light of the inherent limitations on the ability to ,Public
     determine the precise number of combatant and non-combatant ,Public
     deaths given the non-permissive environments in which these ,Public
     strikes often occur. The U.S. Government remains committed to ,Public
     considering new credible information regarding non-combatant ,Public
     deaths that may emerge and revising previous assessments as ,Public
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker if we want to have an ,Public
honest debate about the War Powers Act then let's have an honest ,Public
  Why didn't we hear anything from our colleagues on the other side of ,Public
the aisle about Libya when President Barack Obama took action that led ,Public
to the death of Muammar Qadhafi? Why not Syria? Why not Yemen? Why is ,Public
  The only reason Iran is singled out in this resolution is to take a ,Public
political jab at President Trump for utilizing an airstrike to take out ,Public
General Soleimani a terrorist who was responsible for killing ,Public
thousands of Americans partner troops and yes Iranians.,Public
  While our colleagues are upset with the use of airstrikes to kill ,Public
General Soleimani I remind them that the Obama administration ,Public
according to their own Director of National Intelligence conducted ,Public
hundreds of airstrikes averaging more than six kills a week between ,Public
January 2009 and December 2015 and that was in areas of ,Public
nonhostilities. That doesn't even include Iraq Afghanistan and Syria ,Public
  Let's just be honest about what this is. This is another partisan ,Public
attack against the President of the United States for killing General ,Public
Soleimani who was a terrorist in an area where the President had the ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may ,Public
consume to respond to the gentleman from Georgia who I have a great ,Public
  Let's be honest here. Many of us contrary to what the gentleman just ,Public
said have been outspoken against unilateral interventions by the ,Public
executive branch without notifying Congress without seeking our ,Public
approval on military authorization under Obama. I for one was ,Public
critical of his drone attacks. I raised issues about our involvement in ,Public
  I include in the Record a statement that I made saying that Congress ,Public
should reconvene and debate and vote on a resolution with regard to ,Public
       Washington DC.--For several weeks now I have been calling ,Public
     for an internationally-enforced no-fly-zone over Libya in ,Public
     order to prevent Colonel Qadaffi from slaughtering his own ,Public
     people. I agree with President Obama that U.S. ground troops ,Public
     should not be committed to this effort and that our ,Public
     international partners should soon take the lead. Whether or ,Public
     not Qadaffi remains the leader of Libya must in the end be ,Public
     up to the Libyan people. I am troubled about pressure to ,Public
     expand the military operation and the many unanswered ,Public
     questions about Libyan opposition forces. I urge the House ,Public
     leadership to call the Congress back into session as soon as ,Public
     possible so that Congress can exercise its constitutional ,Public
     responsibility to clearly spell out the mission and limits of ,Public
     U.S. military engagement in Libya. And I urge the Obama ,Public
     Administration to consult with Congress and to engage us at ,Public
     every possible opportunity as this crisis continues to ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker some of us have been consistent on this ,Public
through Democratic and Rean administrations. I take great ,Public
exception when anybody tries to say that we are raising this issue just ,Public

1 hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking ,Public
minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.,Public
  The gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) and the gentleman from Texas ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members ,Public
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  Madam Speaker it is a little surprising that we find ourselves back ,Public
on the floor debating this resolution. After all it has already passed ,Public
both Chambers with bipartisan support. It has passed the Senate twice.,Public
  Opponents of this measure have used every trick in the book to slow ,Public
it down to try and derail it but we have reached the last page in ,Public
that book and I am confident that after we vote today this resolution ,Public
will head to the President's desk and the President will have to face ,Public
the reality that Congress is no longer going to ignore its ,Public
constitutional obligations when it comes to foreign policy and when it ,Public
comes to determining when and where our military is engaged in ,Public
  We are taking up this resolution because we see a policy from this ,Public
administration that has strayed from our values and a crisis that ,Public
demands moral leadership which is the war in Yemen.,Public
  I fully understand America's security concerns in Yemen. I appreciate ,Public
the complexities of our interests in the region. The Houthis are ,Public
trouble. They launch missiles and armed UAVs into Saudi territory and ,Public
international waters and that is a direct threat to Americans. They ,Public
are starving the Yemeni people diverting assistance and holding ,Public
  The Houthis are one of the groups Iran uses to drive instability and ,Public
gain influence. We all know what a serious threat Iran poses in the ,Public
region. The regime is the world's prolific state sponsor of terrorism ,Public
so it is important that we push back against Iran and those who depend ,Public
  But the Saudi-led coalition's response has not grappled with this ,Public
problem in a responsible way in a way designed to minimize damage to ,Public
civilians and the communities where they live and in a way that could ,Public
help bring about a political solution to this crisis.,Public
  Instead time after time after time coalition strikes have resulted ,Public
in the loss of innocent life and the violence has set off ripple ,Public
effects that have contributed to the worst humanitarian crisis in the ,Public
  Madam Speaker 85000 children have starved to death and 14 million ,Public
are on the brink of famine. More than 1 million suffer from cholera ,Public
and just last week the coalition reportedly bombed a hospital run by ,Public
  In the face of this catastrophe the administration has demanded no ,Public
accountability from the Saudis and Emiratis. But Congress won't remain ,Public
  This brings us once again to the resolution we are now considering. ,Public
This measure would specifically ban aerial refueling of warplanes ,Public
carrying out airstrikes. The Defense Department has stopped refueling ,Public
as a matter of policy. This measure would do so as a matter of law.,Public
  The Defense Department also says that the United States is not ,Public
engaged in hostilities when it comes to this war. Well the Defense ,Public
Department is entitled to its opinion but Congress is a coequal branch ,Public
of government and only we say when the United States is at war. We ,Public
don't look to the executive branch to explain the war powers that ,Public
reside in this body or for permission to exercise that power the power ,Public
  This measure is written very narrowly so it won't tie the hands of ,Public
the executive branch or set new precedents or cause unintended ,Public
consequences when it comes to our other security agreements around the ,Public
  It does nothing to expand or modify the authority provided under the ,Public
Authorization for Use of Military Force this body passed in 2001. ,Public
Instead it focuses on this particular tragedy and sends the message ,Public
that enough is enough that Congress will no longer abdicate its ,Public
responsibility when it comes to foreign policy and that we will push ,Public
to make sure our values are at the core of how the United States ,Public
  This resolution is rooted in those values: respect for human rights ,Public
for human dignity and for the belief that all people should be able to ,Public
  I hope the President understands that; and if he uses his veto pen I ,Public
hope he understands just what it is he is vetoing.,Public
  Let me thank Mr. Khanna for his hard work and leadership on the ,Public
  I also want to thank our ranking member on the Foreign Affairs ,Public
Committee Mr. McCaul. We have an honest disagreement on this one but ,Public
he has consistently and forthrightly made his case on the policy. I am ,Public
grateful to all my colleagues who have contributed so much to this ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  Madam Speaker let me first say at the outset that the chairman and ,Public
I work very closely together. There is a recent article that said that ,Public
Chairman Eliot Engel and Ranking Member McCaul forge a rare bipartisan ,Public
bond and I think that is the way we like to conduct this committee. It ,Public
is a national security committee and it needs to be bipartisan. ,Public
However as the chairman mentioned there are times when we do have ,Public
policy differences but we do have respect in those differences.,Public
  We did take this up on the floor several weeks ago. I did oppose it ,Public
then and I oppose it for the same reasons today most importantly ,Public
because the resolution uses the war powers mechanisms to direct the ,Public
  The problem is there are no U.S. Forces to remove and the basic ,Public
premise of this resolution is that somehow we have forces in Yemen that ,Public
need to be removed that are engaged in hostilities. As the Department ,Public
has repeatedly confirmed no United States Forces are conducting ,Public
  This resolution abuses a war powers tool to get at a completely ,Public
different security assistance issue which Congress already has clear ,Public
tools to address. If Members want to condition or cut off U.S. security ,Public
assistance to Saudi Arabia then bring forward a bill to do just that.,Public
  But this resolution does nothing to address the humanitarian crisis ,Public
in Yemen. It does nothing to secure justice for the heinous murder of ,Public
Jamal Khashoggi. It does not even make real decisions on U.S. security ,Public
assistance to Saudi Arabia. The only thing it addresses clearly is the ,Public
midair refueling of coalition aircraft ended in November of 2018 ,Public
  Meanwhile this resolution stretches the definition of war powers ,Public
hostilities to cover non-U.S. military operations by other countries. ,Public
Specifically it reinterprets U.S. support to these countries as ,Public
  This radical reinterpretation has implications far beyond Saudi ,Public
Arabia. This precedent will empower any single Member to use privileged ,Public
war powers procedures to force congressional referendums that could ,Public
disrupt U.S. security cooperation agreements with more than 100 ,Public
  Just days after Israel was forced to respond to rocket attacks from ,Public
Gaza I believe this would be a dangerous precedent to legitimize this ,Public
  It could also be used to call into question our commitments to NATO ,Public
members. Let me remind my colleagues that we are celebrating NATO's ,Public
70th anniversary this week as we saw the Secretary of NATO address a ,Public
  Finally this one-sided resolution completely ignores the destructive ,Public
role of the Houthis and their backers in Tehran. The Houthis violently ,Public
overthrew the Government of Yemen. They are attacking Saudi Arabia with ,Public
weapons they got from Iran in violation of the U.N. Security Council ,Public
resolutions. They have killed Saudi civilians and endangered many ,Public
  Human Rights Watch accused the Houthis of taking hostages and ,Public
torturing detainees. The United Nations says the Houthis use civilian ,Public
human shields. The World Food Program has criticized them for illegally ,Public
stealing urgently needed food aid. The Houthis have targeted ships in ,Public
  These realities are ignored in the text of this resolution. The only ,Public
impact this resolution will have on the Houthis will be to encourage ,Public
  In addition Madam Speaker this is very important because since the ,Public
last time we debated this on the floor the Houthis engaged in a ,Public
propaganda outlet supported by Hezbollah actively touting this very ,Public
resolution online. They used our debate on the floor of the Congress to ,Public
advance their propaganda a proxy of Iran and Yemen.,Public
  This is what we are doing here today. I would submit Madam Speaker ,Public
that is very dangerous. It is dangerous and I believe it is reckless.,Public
  This will weaken the hand of the U.N. Special Envoy as well to ,Public
Yemen whose efforts currently represent the best hope we have of ,Public
bringing a negotiated end to this conflict and ending the suffering of ,Public
  So for these reasons I continue to oppose this pro-Iran pro-Houthi ,Public
resolution. I hope that my colleagues will join me in voting against ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
  Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker the blood of innocents stains this Trump ,Public
administration. And while the Trump family pals around with Saudi ,Public
murderers that blood continues to flow in the world's worst ,Public
humanitarian disaster. Only last week four years after the first Saudi ,Public
assault on Yemen they killed another group of children at a hospital ,Public
  Just as the Trump administration has aided and abetted war crimes in ,Public
Yemen this Congress has aided and abetted the Trump administration in ,Public
  Last year Reans blocked any consideration of a bipartisan ,Public
Senate resolution to stop U.S. involvement in this war. Most recently ,Public
these folks used a devious motion to recommit whose real purpose was ,Public
not the very worthy goal of condemning anti-Semitism but the sole ,Public
purpose was to obstruct this resolution and ensure it never became ,Public
  Today we must reject any such motion--no matter how worthy it may ,Public
be it can be dealt with in other legislation--in order to halt all ,Public
  We are talking about our relations with the Saudis. You know those ,Public
folks Madam Speaker. They are the ones with the leader with the bone ,Public
saw to dismember an opponent and who tortures women for asserting their ,Public
  Hearts do break for those who are lost and tortured but until we ,Public
break with the Saudis in Yemen the bombing the starvation the ,Public
  Months years hundreds of small graves ago this Congress should ,Public
have done its job. Today is a moment of moral clarity a moment for ,Public
this Chamber to act as the Constitution requires: to weigh war and ,Public
peace and for once to extract ourselves from a war we did not start ,Public
  We can finally place a clean War Powers Act resolution directly on ,Public
President Trump's desk and do so today. Let us do what is right and ,Public
let us do so before more young lives are destroyed.,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I continue to reserve the balance of my ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from ,Public
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker first of all let me thank ,Public
Chairman Engel for yielding and also for his leadership.,Public
  Also I want to just mention Congressmen Khanna Pocan and McGovern. ,Public
I want to also thank them in addition to Chairman Engel for bringing ,Public
  Madam Speaker I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 7 which of ,Public
course is a joint resolution directing the removal of U.S. Armed ,Public
  This critical resolution which we are taking now for the second time ,Public
this Congress would end America's unconstitutional participation in ,Public
  Since 2015 the United States has participated in the Saudi-led ,Public
military campaign in Yemen without authorization from Congress. We have ,Public
helped create and worsen the world's greatest and largest humanitarian ,Public
  Madam Speaker 22.2 million Yemenis--that is 75 percent of the ,Public
  At least 85000 children under the age of 5--85000--have died from ,Public
  Our involvement in this war is shameful. That is why this bipartisan ,Public
and bicameral measure to end the United States' unconstitutional role ,Public
  Yes Madam Speaker I voted against that 2001 resolution because I ,Public
knew it was open-ended and would set the stage for endless wars. It was ,Public
a blank check. We see this once again today in Yemen. We must repeal ,Public
  Over the past 18 years we have seen the executive branch use this ,Public
AUMF time and time again. It is a blank check to wage war without ,Public
  It is past time for Congress to reassert our Constitutional duty to ,Public
debate on matters of war and peace and it is past time to end this ,Public
  Madam Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and to support ,Public
this bipartisan bill to end the United States' role in Yemen.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman ,Public
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman from New York ,Public
and the gentleman from Texas. We may have some agreements because ,Public
frankly I think there is not one person on this floor in this House ,Public
and in the Senate who does not believe that there has been enormous ,Public
  I have been to Yemen. I want to go back. I know that it is if not ,Public
the poorest one of the poorest nations in the world. The children are ,Public
  If the United States should be engaged in any aspect of this let our ,Public
  I think it is important to remind my colleagues of the vicious ,Public
bombing of an innocent school bus where 40 children died and any number ,Public
of other incidences where children were involved and died.,Public
  Now these children are suffering from malnutrition and are dying ,Public
from lack of access to healthcare as well as no food. We can be a ,Public
major force the United States in providing that humanitarian aid.,Public
  But this is a resolution already passed by the other body the ,Public
Senate that indicates that if we are to be engaged in a war there ,Public
must be a debate under the Constitution about taking Americans into ,Public
war. Because the Americans who offer their sons and daughters clearly ,Public
are sacrificing. And those who put on the uniform--and we thank them--,Public
  This is a conflict between the Saudis and Houthis. It is a violence ,Public
that is going to go on and on. And if we are to prop them up--the ,Public
Saudis--they will never stop. They will never seek reconciliation. They ,Public
will never stop killing the babies because of an ``accident'' they ,Public
declared: It was a mistake. We don't know how it happened.,Public
  We cannot allow Yemeni children or any children to be in the line ,Public
  So this resolution indicates that the Congress must make a ,Public
determinative if you will assessment and engagement through the War ,Public
Powers Act and its powers to declare war under the Constitution.,Public
  Frankly I believe that this is a must-pass resolution. It must be ,Public
signed immediately and can be signed by the President of the United ,Public
States and we can begin to in an effective manner withdraw troops ,Public
and provide humanitarian aid to save the lives of children.,Public
  Madam Speaker I support the resolution and I thank the Senate for ,Public
sending it to us. We should vote on it and pass it now.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ,Public
  Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker I thank the chairman for his ,Public
leadership on this and I really want to thank Representative Ro Khanna ,Public
for his continued steadfast efforts to end this situation.,Public
  So I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution and ,Public
finally end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.,Public
  If we fail to act today if we let one more opportunity to end these ,Public
horrors pass us by we are telling the world we are okay with another ,Public
day in which innocent civilians are killed; another day that nearly 20 ,Public
million people go without basic healthcare and even more in need of ,Public
emergency food aid; another day that a child must battle illnesses that ,Public
could easily have been prevented if not for this crisis happening on ,Public
  We have an opportunity as Members of this body Reans and ,Public
Democrats to tackle the difficult problems and have the debates that ,Public
others have ignored for too long. This is one of those problems. And ,Public
this is one of those moments that makes me optimistic that the tide is ,Public
  I want to thank the chairman for making this a top priority. It is ,Public
long past time for Congress to reassert its role our role in foreign ,Public
  Seeing the level of suffering in Yemen we cannot wait one more day ,Public
to do it. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
from California (Mr. Khanna) who has been so instrumental in bringing ,Public
everyone together to make a change in policy that is much needed.,Public
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker I want to thank the chairman for his ,Public
leadership and his entire staff's leadership for getting us to this ,Public
point. Let me be very clear. If it weren't for Chairman Engel we would ,Public
  My motivation for this bill is very simple. I don't want to see 14 ,Public
million Yemenis starve to death. That is what Martin Griffith had said ,Public
at the U.N. that if the Saudis don't stop their blockade and let food ,Public
and medicine in within 6 months we will see one of the greatest ,Public
  That should be a bipartisan issue that this Congress speak with a ,Public
moral voice that food and medicine should get to civilians.,Public
  Now as Chairman Engel knows and others know I am not for the BDS ,Public
movement. I have supported very strongly resolutions condemning anti-,Public
Semitism. But I also don't think that these tactics should be used as ,Public
weapons to prevent efforts to stop the greatest humanitarian crisis in ,Public
  Those issues should be voted on separately and I will proudly vote ,Public
  Madam Speaker I want to with that thank again Chairman Engel ,Public
Representative McGovern Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer and ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ,Public
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding and I ,Public
rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 7 invoking the War Powers ,Public
Resolution to withdraw U.S. military support for the Gulf coalition in ,Public
  For 4 years the war in Yemen has ground on killing tens of ,Public
thousands of Yemeni civilians and putting millions at imminent risk of ,Public
  The cause of the war is complicated and has much to do with Iran's ,Public
  But our interest today is not in debating the blame for the war but ,Public
in bringing it to an end. That is why I urge all Members to support ,Public
this resolution because it is in our interest and above all in the ,Public
  U.S. military support for the Saudi coalition has not prevented ,Public
civilian suffering and it is my hope that by withdrawing our support ,Public
we will make clear that a diplomatic resolution is the only resolution ,Public
  Madam Speaker I urge support for this resolution. I urge Members to ,Public
oppose any motion to commit which would have the effect of killing ,Public
this bill and prolonging the world's worst humanitarian crisis.,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  As I close I include in the Record a statement of administration ,Public
  S.J. Res. 7--Directing the President to Remove United States Armed ,Public
  Forces from Hostilities in the Re of Yemen that Have Not Been ,Public
      Authorized by Congress--Sen. Sanders I-VT and 19 cosponsors,Public
       The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 7 ,Public
     a joint resolution that purports to direct the President to ,Public
     remove United States forces from hostilities in or affecting ,Public
       The premise of the joint resolution is flawed. Since 2015 ,Public
     the United States has provided limited support to member ,Public
     countries of the Saudi-led coalition including intelligence ,Public
     sharing logistics support and until recently aerial ,Public
     refueling to assist in the defense of United States allies ,Public
     and partners. The provision of this support has not caused ,Public
     United States forces to be introduced into hostilities. Such ,Public
     support is provided pursuant to licenses and approvals under ,Public
     the Arms Export Control Act statutory authorities for ,Public
     Department of Defense to provide logistics support to foreign ,Public
     countries and the President's constitutional powers. Because ,Public
     the President has directed United States forces to support ,Public
     the Saudi-led coalition under his constitutional powers the ,Public
     joint resolution would raise serious constitutional concerns ,Public
     to the extent it seeks to override the President's ,Public
       In addition to its erroneous premise the joint resolution ,Public
     would harm bilateral relationships in the region negatively ,Public
     affect our ability to prevent the spread of violent extremist ,Public
     organizations--such as al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula and ,Public
     ISIS in Yemen--and establish bad precedent for future ,Public
     legislation by defining ``hostilities'' to include defense ,Public
     cooperation such as aerial refueling for purposes of this ,Public
     legislation. While we appreciate that sections 5 and 6 of the ,Public
     resolution acknowledge these serious consequences to some ,Public
     extent after-the-fact reporting is not an effective means to ,Public
     mitigate them. Our continued cooperation with regional ,Public
     partner nations allows the United States to support ,Public
     diplomatic negotiations to end the conflict promote ,Public
     humanitarian access mitigate civilian casualties enhance ,Public
     efforts to recover United States hostages in Yemen and ,Public
     defeat terrorists who seek to harm the United States.,Public
       If S.J. Res. 7 were presented to the President his senior ,Public
     advisors would recommend he veto the joint resolution.,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker it really basically states yet again ,Public
that the fundamental premise of this resolution is flawed because U.S. ,Public
forces are not engaged in hostilities against the Houthis in Yemen ,Public
  If we want to cut off economic assistance or logistic assistance ,Public
security assistance to Saudi there is a way to do that but it is not ,Public
  I think it is unfortunate that we couldn't work that out but I think ,Public
we are using the wrong vehicle here. I think this confrontation abuses ,Public
the War Powers process and we need to protect the integrity of the War ,Public
  Also what worries me is the resolution stays silent on the role of ,Public
Iran. It does not condemn the Houthis who are responsible for the ,Public
killings. It tells them both to press on. It also undermines the peace ,Public
negotiations going on as I speak. The U.S. envoy is working with the ,Public
full support of the United States to negotiate a political end to this ,Public
  Getting all parties to the table has taken substantial pressure ,Public
  Again I think the fact that the Houthis are using this resolution as ,Public
propaganda to advance their cause is concerning and disturbing.,Public
  The other side cannot tell us specifically what assistance this ,Public
resolution would cut off. What I can say for sure is that this ,Public
resolution says to the Houthis and to Iran to keep going because you ,Public
  It only emboldens the rebels who violently overthrew Yemen's ,Public
government and the radical regime that backs them. That would be Iran.,Public
  So I think this resolution would set a dangerous precedent with ,Public
respect to the War Powers Act a dangerous damaging policy. Once ,Public
again Madam Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote against it and I ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  In closing let me say this. Everyone who knows me knows that I hold ,Public
Iran guilty to many nefarious things that are happening in that region. ,Public
This is not really about Iran. Iran is providing dangerous weapons to ,Public
the Houthis and the Houthis have starved the Yemeni people killed ,Public
civilians and diverted assistance. I am not here to defend the ,Public
  The Saudis do have legitimate concerns about the Houthis and the ,Public
Houthis are not my vision of good and righteous. Quite the opposite.,Public
  But this resolution doesn't empower Iran. Quite the opposite. The ,Public
longer the conflict goes on and the longer the United States supports ,Public
  We are really doing two things here. We are saying to the ,Public
administration--and I frankly would say this given my experience ,Public
over the past two decades--to any administration. There is no blank ,Public
check for war. We have abrogated our responsibility in the years that I ,Public
have been here--and I am as guilty as anyone--by allowing ,Public
administration after administration after administration to conduct ,Public
  Only Congress can declare war. And if we ignore what is happening ,Public
with the civilian population in this war with the Houthis then we do ,Public
so at our own peril. We then say that because Saudi Arabia does have ,Public
legitimate concerns--and they do--we are giving them a blank check to ,Public
  No blank checks anymore. No blank checks to say the administration ,Public
can run wars without getting the approval of Congress. And no blank ,Public
checks to indiscriminately bomb and have innocent civilians and ,Public
schoolchildren in buses be killed and people starving in a ,Public
  We can't just sit back and say: ``Well you know we have ,Public
difficulties with Iran so we are going to look the other way.'' I have ,Public
lots of difficulties with Iran but we can't look the other way when ,Public
people are starving or when people are being killed. That is what we ,Public
  So we are doing two things. We are saying no more war in which we are ,Public
complicit where a population is wholesale starving. We are also saying ,Public
that this body is not giving a blank check to every administration. And ,Public
I would be doing this no matter who the President of the United States ,Public
  We need to reclaim our authority. We have fought in war after war ,Public
after war. As everyone knows we haven't declared war since before all ,Public
of us were born since December 71941 when President Roosevelt stood ,Public
up right here and declared war. That was the last time.,Public
  I hope this will be the start of Congress taking back its ,Public
constitutional power not for the sake of having a fight with the ,Public
executive branch but for the sake of doing what we are supposed to do.,Public
  Congress has the power to declare war. Congress has the power to say ,Public
what we do when it comes to war. We are taking that back today. We are ,Public
saying that America will not be complicit in the wholesale beating down ,Public
of civilian populations and looking the other way.,Public
  Let me say that again. Iran has fueled this conflict through its ,Public
support for the Houthis but the longer this conflict rages the better ,Public
it is for Iran. Iran thrives on every misstep of the Saudi-led ,Public
coalition. A vote for this resolution is a vote to end the United ,Public
States' involvement in this war a war which helps Iran.,Public
  Let me say again for Congress this is an important step in ,Public
reclaiming our role in foreign policy by debating where and when the ,Public
United States military is engaged abroad. With the humanitarian crisis ,Public
in Yemen it is critical that we act now. I urge my colleagues to join ,Public
  Before I yield back I want to again tell Mr. McCaul that we don't ,Public
always agree on things. I think we agree on things more than we don't. ,Public
But I do appreciate his earnest attempts with me to try to make foreign ,Public
policy as bipartisan as we can. I think that is what we need to do.,Public
  We need to show unity in strength. In unity there is strength. We ,Public
are all Americans. We may disagree from time to time but I think we ,Public
are not going to be disagreeable. So I thank Mr. McCaul.,Public
  Madam Speaker I yield back the balance of my time.,Public
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker I rise today in strong support of ,Public
S.J. Res. 7 which directs the removal of United States Armed Forces ,Public
from hostilities in the Re of Yemen that have not been authorized ,Public
  The passage of S.J. Res. 7 would mark the first time in the 45 years ,Public
since the enactment of the War Powers Act that the House of ,Public
Representatives successfully invoked the statute's removal mechanism to ,Public
compel the Executive Branch to remove American troops from harm's way.,Public
  I support this resolution because Congress has the sole power to ,Public
declare war under Article I Section 8 Clause 11 of the United States ,Public
  Madam Speaker Congress has not declared war with respect to or ,Public
provided a specific statutory authorization for the conflict between ,Public
military forces led by Saudi Arabia including forces from the United ,Public
Arab Emirates Bahrain Kuwait Egypt Jordan Morocco Senegal and ,Public
Sudan (the Saudi-led coalition) against the Houthis also known as ,Public
  Since March 2015 members of the United States Armed Forces have been ,Public
introduced into hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the ,Public
Houthis including providing to the Saudi-led coalition aerial ,Public
targeting assistance intelligence sharing and mid-flight aerial ,Public
  The United States has established a Joint Combined Planning Cell with ,Public
Saudi Arabia in which members of the United States Armed Forces assist ,Public
in aerial targeting and help to coordinate military and intelligence ,Public
  Madam Speaker the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and the ,Public
Houthis constitutes within the meaning of Section 4(a) of the War ,Public
Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)) either hostilities or a ,Public
situation where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly ,Public
indicated by the circumstances into which United States Armed Forces ,Public
  Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states ,Public
that ``at any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in ,Public
hostilities outside the territory of the United States its possessions ,Public
and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory ,Public
authorization such forces shall be removed by the President if the ,Public
  Most importantly no specific statutory authorization for the use of ,Public
Forces with respect to the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and ,Public
  Also no provision of law explicitly authorizes the provision of ,Public
targeting assistance or of midair refueling services to warplanes of ,Public
Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates that are engaged in such ,Public
  For this reason the resolution directs that the President remove ,Public
United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the ,Public
Re of Yemen except United States Armed Forces engaged in ,Public
operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces by not later than ,Public
the date that is 30 days after the date of the enactment.,Public
  The resolution makes clear that the term ``hostilities'' includes in-,Public
flight refueling non-United States aircraft conducting missions as ,Public
  Madam Speaker Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world ,Public
right now. The Yemen crisis began in the Arab Spring of 2011 when an ,Public
uprising forced the country's long-time authoritarian president Ali ,Public
Abdullah Saleh to hand over power to his deputy Abdrabbuh Mansour ,Public
  Since 2015 Saudi Arabia has launched an estimated 18000 air strikes ,Public
on Yemen attacking hospitals schools water treatment plants ,Public
  The Saudis also imposed a blockade on food fuel and medicine from ,Public
freely entering the country in what can only be described as a ,Public
deliberate effort to starve the civilian population into submission.,Public
  More than 14 million Yemenis are steps away from starvation and at ,Public
least 85000 children under the age of five have perished from war-,Public
  The United States has supported the Saudi led air campaign with mid-,Public
air refueling support intelligence and targeting assistance and other ,Public
  Yemen is experiencing the world's worst famine in 100 years with 12 ,Public

      SUPPORT OF H.R. 2500 THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT,Public
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker last Friday I voted in support of H.R. ,Public
2500 the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year ,Public
  While I have consistently opposed this legislation in previous years ,Public
and still have concerns about a number of provisions included in this ,Public
year's legislation--including yet another spending increase to an ,Public
already bloated Pentagon budget--this legislation also contains ,Public
numerous policy priorities that I strongly support and which have not ,Public
  First this legislation grants our men and women in uniform a well-,Public
deserved pay raise of 3.1 percent--the largest pay raise for our troops ,Public
since the last Democratic House majority in 2010. Those who serve in ,Public
uniform continue to make extraordinary sacrifices for our country and ,Public
the very least we can do is grant them a pay raise.,Public
  I am pleased that this legislation also includes numerous provisions ,Public
that require the Department of Defense (DoD) to address the existential ,Public
threat of climate change including updating military construction ,Public
standards to promote energy and climate resilience. It also requires ,Public
DoD to report on its progress towards meeting the goal of 25 percent ,Public
  Additionally I am pleased that this legislation prevents the ,Public
president from diverting defense funding to pay for an unnecessary ,Public
border wall prohibits funding for the deployment of dangerous low-,Public
yield nuclear weapons nullifies President Trump's discriminatory ,Public
military transgender ban and helps protect our veterans from being ,Public
taken advantage of by predatory for-profit colleges. Moreover it ends ,Public
the unfair Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP)/Indemnity Compensation (DIC) ,Public
offset--also known as the ``widow's tax''--which currently reduces ,Public
spouse survivor benefits by an average of $1250 per month. I am also ,Public
strongly supportive of the inclusion of twelve weeks of paid family and ,Public
  This legislation also includes several provisions to strengthen our ,Public
national security including requiring the DoD to enhance our election ,Public
security countering Russian aggression and election interference ,Public
enhancing security cooperation with our allies in Europe and Asia and ,Public
protecting against the increasing risk of cyber attacks.,Public
  I have always advocated for strengthening Congress's constitutional ,Public
authority to declare war and limiting the president's authority to ,Public
engage in armed conflict without the consent of Congress. That's why I ,Public
voted in support of amendments to prevent the president from using ,Public
unauthorized force against Iran to prohibit U.S. support to and ,Public
participation in the Saudi-led coalition's military operations in ,Public
Yemen and to repeal the long-outdated 2002 authorization for the use ,Public
of military force (AUMF) in Iraq. I am proud that these amendments ,Public
  This year I have once again introduced legislation to amend the War ,Public
of 1973 and reassert Congress's constitutional war powers. I have also ,Public
consistently supported legislation to repeal the 2001 AUMF which the ,Public
Pentagon uses to continue to justify the 18 years our troops have been ,Public
fighting in the Middle East. President Trump has sent troops to Syria ,Public
Yemen and elsewhere without seeking a new AUMF which in my view is a ,Public
  Furthermore I am pleased that this legislation accelerates closure ,Public
of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility by prohibiting new detainees ,Public
and allowing transfer of detainees to secure facilities in the United ,Public
States. This unnecessary facility costs almost $450 million each year ,Public
to house 40 prisoners and has been used as a top recruiting tool by ,Public
terrorists. The prison at Guantanamo Bay has been a black eye for the ,Public
United States eroding relationships with our allies undermining U.S. ,Public
missions abroad and putting U.S. citizens and our troops at risk of ,Public
  However I believe this legislation could have made responsible cuts ,Public
to our defense budget without jeopardizing the safety of our troops or ,Public
undermining our national security. For years Congress has continued to ,Public
increase the Pentagon's budget despite overwhelming evidence of its ,Public
waste and abuse of taxpayer money. This year's legislation--with its ,Public
outrageous top line defense budget of $733 billion--is yet another ,Public
example of Congress's habit of increasing the defense budget every ,Public
  I have long supported a financial audit of the Pentagon. Unlike every ,Public
other federal agency the DoD has yet to pass a financial audit. In ,Public
Nov-18 the Pentagon spectacularly failed its first full audit ,Public
which highlighted numerous examples of waste and abuse. While I am ,Public
pleased that this year's NDAA requires an annual audit of the DoD in ,Public
order to help identify waste it is ridiculous to provide the Pentagon ,Public
a massive spending increase--as this bill does--when the Pentagon ,Public
cannot even account for how it spends taxpayer money.,Public
  In particular I have always opposed the DoD's Overseas Contingency ,Public
Operation (OCO) account a fiscally irresponsible fund that is not ,Public
counted in the budget recklessly adds to our mounting debt and has no ,Public
congressional oversight. OCO is a Pentagon slush fund that gives a ,Public
blank check to fund endless wars that Congress hasn't authorized. ,Public
That's why I co-led an amendment to cut OCO funding in the bill by ,Public
approximately 25 percent. I am disappointed that this amendment failed ,Public
  The bottom line is that fiscal responsibility and accountability at ,Public
the Pentagon would allow for funds to be better spent supporting the ,Public
needs of our troops meeting our obligations to veterans and ensuring ,Public
our legitimate defense needs are prioritized. I strongly encourage my ,Public
Senate colleagues to keep the strong provisions included in the House ,Public

          PRESIDENT NEEDS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR MILITARY ACTION,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from ,Public
  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker young men and women enlisting in our ,Public
military for the first time will enter recruitment offices across our ,Public
  On their IDs will be birth dates that reflect the fact that they are ,Public
signing up to fight in wars that started before they were born.,Public
  Nineteen years. That is how long we have been in Afghanistan. ,Public
Seventeen years. That is how long we have been in Iraq. Not to mention ,Public
the American weapons the American dollars the American boots the ,Public
American lives that have been sent to Yemen Syria Somalia and many ,Public
  We are a generation that has spent the better part of its life at war ,Public
in a country in the Middle East perpetual wars fought under the cover ,Public
of two permission slips that this body gave the executive branch nearly ,Public
  In 2001 Congress authorized our offensive against al-Qaida and the ,Public
Taliban in the wake of 9/11 in what became the largest armed conflict ,Public
in American history. In 2002 Congress authorized the invasion of Iraq ,Public
and it became the greatest foreign policy mistake of a generation.,Public
  And our response has been silence silence from this collective body; ,Public
silence as we have sent hundreds of thousands of American men and women ,Public
to Afghanistan and tens of thousands more to Iraq; silence as three ,Public
administrations Democratic and Rean have used these two ,Public
authorizations to expand to evolve to justify and to prolong our ,Public
presence in a volatile and violent region; and silence as our role has ,Public
  What we have lost in this silence is hard to quantify--the lives that ,Public
could have been spared the families we could have protected the money ,Public
we could have used to do good and the credibility we could have saved ,Public
if we had summoned the collective courage to tear up those permission ,Public
  The vote today on the War Powers Resolution to restrict the current ,Public
administration's actions against Iran is an important one. It is a ,Public
necessary response to a reckless President without a plan. But it is ,Public
not enough because yesterday this administration told us that the ,Public
legal authority to launch a strike targeting Iran 6 days ago was ,Public
granted based on the authority that this body allowed to invade Iraq 18 ,Public
years ago using a deceased dictator to justify a potential war against ,Public
an entirely different adversary making a mockery of matters of war and ,Public
  So now facing the threat of war with a different yet brutal regime ,Public
this body must finally act to cut off any avenue that this President or ,Public
any other President has to enter our people into a war that we do not ,Public
want because this isn't just about the actions of a current ,Public
administration. It is about the precedent that we set from this day ,Public
  We must pass a War Powers Resolution today. We must repeal the 2001 ,Public
and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force. We must compel the ,Public

  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President today I wish to discuss Senate amendment ,Public
  The author of the amendment Senator Romney and others have made ,Public
clear that this language does not constitute an authorization of the ,Public
use of military force or AUMF. I agree with that assessment.,Public
  While this amendment appears to restate existing Presidential ,Public
authority to defend the country in the event of an attack it includes ,Public
other language that could be interpreted to provide more authority to ,Public
the President. That concerns me which is why I voted against this ,Public
  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President amendment No. 861 fully captures the ,Public
utter failure of the modern Congress to assert and defend congressional ,Public
war powers that the U.S. Constitution solely vests in the legislative ,Public
branch. It treats matters of life and death as mere fodder for ,Public
votes and represents an approach to legislating that is ultimately as ,Public
  If one asked 10 attorneys to analyze the text of amendment No. 861 ,Public
one might very well receive 10 wildly different interpretations of what ,Public
the undefined terms in the amendment mean from the use of the term ,Public
``attack by the government military forces or proxies of a foreign ,Public
nation or by other hostile forces'' to the phrase ``used to ensure the ,Public
ability of the Armed Forces of the United States to defend themselves ,Public
  As the authors plausibly argue the intent of the amendment may very ,Public
well be to simply reaffirm existing legal interpretations and norms ,Public
that authorize the U.S. Armed Forces to defend itself and our citizens ,Public
against attack by a foreign nation or other hostile force. As ,Public
supporters argue the amendment language avoids using the specific ,Public
phrase ``authorization for use of military force'' and thus one may ,Public
  Yet adopting such an interpretation requires ignoring years of ,Public
executive branch overreach when it comes to taking unilateral military ,Public
action without seeking an authorization for use of military force or a ,Public
  It requires willfully forgetting the behavior of our current ,Public
President and past Presidents of both parties who have chosen to ,Public
define the concept of Commander in Chief under Article II of the U.S. ,Public
Constitution to be less a commander and more an emperor while the ,Public
legislative branch has sat idly by as its war powers were rapidly ,Public
  Congress is a coequal branch of government. It is time we started ,Public
acting like it. We cannot trust any President to take a blank check and ,Public
fill in a reasonable number. I must oppose amendment 861 because in my ,Public
reading any President of any party would adopt the broadest legal ,Public
interpretation possible in defining what constitutes an ``other hostile ,Public
force'' or an ``attack'' or what it means to ``ensure the ability of ,Public
the Armed Forces of the U.S. to defend themselves.'',Public
  This language risks unintentionally authorizing President Trump to ,Public
order all types of military strikes against any number of potential ,Public
entities that the President deems to be a threat. How would the Trump ,Public
administration determine the precise baseline that defines the term ,Public
``ability'' of the military to defend itself? Would allowing the ,Public
degradation of any platform or capability qualify as failing to ,Public
``ensure the ability'' of the U.S. Armed Forces to defend itself? If ,Public
so that would authorize the use of funds in the National Defense ,Public
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 to take unilateral preemptive ,Public
action again a foreign nation or hostile force to preserve the current ,Public
  I am confident the author of this amendment would disagree with this ,Public
interpretation of his legislative language. However would the sponsor ,Public
argue that such an interpretation is unreasonable or not possible? ,Public
Would a Federal Court not defer to the Federal Agency's interpretation ,Public
of a vague and ambiguous statute? I do not know the answer to either ,Public
question; yet I know this: I am not willing to take that risk.,Public
  We are living with the consequences of a previous Congress that ,Public
rushed to pass a concise authorization for use of military force that ,Public
appeared targeted and limited at first. We have watched as Rean ,Public
and Democratic administrations alike subsequently employed creative and ,Public
broad legal interpretations of that authorization to continually expand ,Public
which parties were connected with the horrific terrorist attacks of ,Public
  To this very day the Trump administration cites this authorization ,Public
for use of military force as legal justification to unilaterally deploy ,Public
Americans all around the world even though it was authorized in ,Public
response to an event that took place before some of these troops were ,Public
even born. To be clear I am not asserting that I oppose the premise or ,Public

  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President killings of environmental defenders are ,Public
shockingly common in Latin America Africa and Asia. The assassination ,Public
of Berta Caceres in Honduras 3 years ago orchestrated by top officials ,Public
of a hydroelectric company and carried out by retired and Active-Duty ,Public
soldiers who had received training from the United States was ,Public
emblematic of the widespread use of harassment threats and murder to ,Public
silence those who courageously call for changes in policies and ,Public
  According to a report released today by Global Witness the ,Public
Philippines has the highest number of killings in Asia of people who ,Public
oppose illegal logging destructive mining and corrupt agribusiness ,Public
with at least 30 cases documented in 2018. The total number is likely ,Public
higher as some investigations are ongoing. Many of the victims simply ,Public
wanted a say in how their land and the country's natural resources are ,Public
used. The perpetrators are almost never arrested or prosecuted.,Public
  On July 25 2016 the Philippines' newly elected President Rodrigo ,Public
Duterte delivered his first state of the nation address. He promised to ,Public
safeguard the country's rural and indigenous communities tackle ,Public
corruption and protect the environment. The results since then paint a ,Public
very different and distressing picture. If President Duterte meant what ,Public
he said he has failed miserably. According to Global Witness in the 3 ,Public
years before Duterte took office at least 65 land and environmental ,Public
defenders were murdered. That was appalling enough. But in the 3 years ,Public
since he came to power that number rose to 113. At least 31 of those ,Public
murders were reportedly committed by the Philippine Armed Forces whose ,Public
soldiers and officers act with near total impunity.,Public
  The Philippines is a major recipient of U.S. military aid and we are ,Public
perceived by the families of the victims to be enablers of these ,Public
crimes. In addition to increasing support for local environmental ,Public
defenders the Secretary of State and Administrator of the U.S. Agency ,Public
for International Development should urge the Duterte government to ,Public
ensure that the right to free prior and informed consent of those ,Public
impacted by policies and practices that threaten their land and natural ,Public
resources is respected. This is necessary not only to prevent the ,Public
destruction of forests and farms the pollution of watersheds and the ,Public
extinction of species but to avoid confrontations and violence that ,Public
result when extractive industries supported by the Armed Forces and ,Public
  The Secretaries of State and Defense should also ensure that those in ,Public
the Philippine Armed Forces who receive our aid respect the rights of ,Public
civilians and are accountable to the rule of law. When abuses occur ,Public
they should be thoroughly investigated and the individuals responsible ,Public
brought to justice. The Leahy Laws require that and it is the ,Public
responsibility of U.S. officials to ensure that they are enforced.,Public
