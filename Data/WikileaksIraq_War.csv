THE %%% STATED THAT THE Improvised Explosive Device DETONATED -%%% METERS AHEAD OF THE UNMANNED High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle Humvee ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE ROAD BETWEEN A LARGE OPENING IN THE BARRIERS. THE TEAM REMOTELY CLEARED THE AREA OF SECONDARY DEVICES AND PROCEEDED TO CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF THE SITE. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE, A DETERMINATION OF WHAT THE Improvised Explosive Device CONSISTED OF COULD NOT BE MADE. THERE WAS NO FRAGMENTATION OR LEFT OVER RESIDUE TO INDICATE WHAT TYPE OF INITIATION SYSTEM THE DEVICE CONTAINED. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE BLAST SEAT CRATER, THE Explosive Ordnance Disposal TEAM LEADER ASSESSED THAT THE DEVICE CONTAINED APPROXIMATELY -%%% Pounds OF Unknown Bulk Explosives. THERE HAVE BEEN TWO PREVIOUS ATTACKS AT THE SAME SITE. THE FIRST ATTACK HAPPENED ON 15april09 AND THE SECOND HAPPENED ON 28april09. BOTH Improvised Explosive DeviceS CONSISTED OF %%% THAT WERE COMMAND WIRE INITIATED. THE FACT THAT THE Improvised Explosive Device WENT OFF IN FRONT OF THE FIRST VEHICLE INDICATES THAT THE Improvised Explosive Device MAY HAVE BEEN EITHER Reserve Component OR Passive Infrared INITIATED.

THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO ANY VEHICLES, BARRIERS, OR BUILDINGS. BECAUSE THIS SITE IS NOW FREQUENTLY BEING USED TO %%% Improvised Explosive DeviceS, COMPLETELY BLOCKING OFF THE OPENING WITH ADDITIONAL BARRIERS WOULD BE ADVISABLE TO PREVENT FURTHER ATTACKS FROM THE SAME PLACE.
