On August 5 2007 P.L. 110-55 the Protect America Act of 2007 was signed into law by President Bush after having been passed by the Senate on August 3 and the House of Representatives on August 4. The measure introduced by Senator McConnell as S. 1927 on August 1 makes a number of additions and modifications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) as amended 50 U.S.C. �� 1801 et seq. and adds additional reporting requirements. As originally passed the law was to sunset in 180 days on February 1 2008. On January 29 2008 both the House and the Senate passed H.R. 5104 a 15-day extension to the sunset for the Protect America Act to allow further time to consider pass and go to conference on proposed legislation to amend FISA while ensuring that the intelligence community would have the authority it needed in the intervening period. Signed into law on January 31 it became P.L. 110-182. On February 13 2008 the House rejected H.R. 5349 which would have extended the sunset provision an additional 21 days. Bills have been introduced in the Senate to extend the sunset from 180 to 210 days (S. 2541 S. 2556 and S. 2615) or to extend it to July 1 2009 (S. 2557).,Private
assesses recent international developments as the leaders from a number of nations work to reach a consensus on an informal set of best practices regarding national restrictions on foreign investment for national security purposes. also provides one possible approach for assessing the costs and benefits involved in using national policies to direct or to restrict foreign direct investment for national security reasons. Within the United States there is no consensus yet among Members of Congress or between the Congress and the Administration over a working set of parameters that establishes a functional definition of the national economic security implications of foreign direct investment. In part this issue reflects differing assessments of the economic impact of foreign investment on the U.S. economy and differing political and philosophical convictions among Members and between the Congress and the Administration.,Private
H.R. 3773 S. 2248 and the Senate Judiciary Committee's amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 2248 each includes amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. provides a side by side comparison of the provisions of these three measures. A glossary of FISA terms from section 101 of FISA 50 U.S.C. � 1801 is attached. Other FISA bills have also been introduced such as S. 2440 S. 2441 and S. 2402.

"Section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 P.L. 108-458 amended the definition of ""agent of a foreign power"" in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) 50 U.S.C. � 1801(b)(1) to add a new category of covered individuals. Under this ""lone wolf"" provision a non-United States person who engages in international terrorism or activities in preparation for international terrorism is deemed to be an ""agent of a foreign power"" under FISA. This provision does not change the procedures to be used to apply for a court order authorizing electronic surveillance or a physical search under FISA. If an order is sought under this definition of an ""agent of a foreign power"" however the applicant is not required to demonstrate a connection between the target of the electronic surveillance or the physical search and a foreign nation foreign group or international terrorist group. Nor does the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) in approving such an order have to find probable cause to believe that such a connection existed. Rather if the court authorizes such a surveillance or physical search using this definition of ""agent of a foreign power"" the FISC judge has to find in pertinent part that based upon the information provided by the applicant for the order the target had engaged in or was engaging in international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor. By operation of the sunset provision in Section 103 of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act P.L. 109-177 the amendment to the definition of ""agent of a foreign power"" in FISA will cease to have effect on December 31 2009.",Private
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 was enacted principally to prevent corporate bribery of foreign officials. This act had three major parts: 1. It required the keeping by corporations of accurate books records and accounts; 2. It required issuers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to maintain a responsible internal accounting control system; and 3. It prohibited bribery by American corporations of foreign officials. For a number of years after passage of the act Congress debated amending it in response to numerous criticisms. On August 23 1988 the President signed into law the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 of which Title V is known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Amendments of 1988. The Amendments maintained the three major parts of the 1977 Act but significant changes were made. One of these changes enacted a knowing standard in order to find violations of the act. This standard was intended to encompass conscious disregard and willful blindness. The amendments provided certain defenses against finding violations of the act such as that the gift is lawful under the laws of the foreign country and that the gift is a bona fide and reasonable expenditure or for the performance or execution of a contract with the foreign government. In 1998 the act was further amended in order to implement the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. These amendments expanded the scope of coverage to include some foreign persons and extended jurisdiction beyond the borders of the United States.,Private
"The President is generally seen as exercising broad discretionary authority over developing and implementing U.S. direct investment policy including the authority to suspend or block investments that ""threaten to impair the national security."" Congress is also directly involved in formulating the scope and direction of U.S. foreign investment policy and some Members are urging the President to be more aggressive in blocking certain types of foreign investments. Such confrontations reflect vastly different philosophical and political views between members of Congress and between Congress and the Administration over the role foreign investment plays in the economy and the role that economic activities should play in the context of U.S. national security policy. In July 2007 Congress asserted its own role in making and conducting foreign investment policy when it adopted and the President signed P.L. 110-49 the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007. This law broadens Congress' oversight role and it explicitly includes the areas of homeland security and critical infrastructure as separately identifiable components of national security that the President must consider when evaluating the national security implications of a foreign investment transaction. The act may well draw Congress into a greater dialogue and possibly greater conflict with the Administration over efforts to define the limits of the broad rubric of national economic security.",Private
"The Constitution of the United States makes no specific allowance for any one of the co-equal branches to have access to information held by the others and contains no provision expressly establishing a procedure for or a right of public access to government information. Nonetheless Congress has legislated various public access laws. These include two records access statutes - the Freedom of Information Act (FOI Act or FOIA; 5 U.S.C. � 552) and the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. � 552a) - and two meetings access statutes - the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA; 5 U.S.C. App.) and the Government in the Sunshine Act (5 U.S.C. � 552b). Moreover due to the American separation of powers model of government interbranch conflicts over the accessibility of information are neither unexpected nor necessarily destructive. The federal courts historically have been reluctant to review and resolve ""political questions"" involving information disputes between Congress and the executive branch. Although there is considerable interbranch cooperation such conflicts probably will continue to occur on occasion.",Private
The USA PATRIOT Act sections were originally set to sunset on December 31 2005. By then both Houses had passed legislation that amended and extended the expiring sections (H.R. 3199) and a conference report resolving their differences had been issued H.Rept. 109-433 (2005). In order to provider further time for consideration the expiration date has been extended twice first until February 3 2006 P.L. 109-160 (2006) and more recently until March 10 2006 H.R. 4659 P.L. 109- (2006).,Private
As part of the war on terrorism it is widely recognized that the U.S. government has a substantial and growing need for personnel with knowledge of foreign languages and especially languages that may be spoken in limited and remote areas of the world. In 2002 the federal government employed about a thousand translators and interpreters in four agencies responsible for security-related functions. In addition these agencies employ nearly 20000 staff in positions that require some foreign language proficiency. Yet there is a widespread consensus that requirements for foreign language qualified personnel are not currently being met. The report issued by the 9/11 Commission in July of 2004 makes several references to this deficiency and suggests corrective action to address it.,Private

The Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act H.R. 5825 109th Congress was one of a number of bills introduced in the Senate and the House of Representatives addressing various aspects of the TSP and a variety of approaches to electronic surveillance of terrorists and those affiliated with them. This bill was designed to enhance flexibility in electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information while requiring increased reporting and congressional oversight of these activities. The measure was introduced on July 18 2006 and passed the House on September 28 2006. summarizes the bill as passed by the House and analyzes the potential impact of its provisions were they to become law. The 110th Congress may wish to contemplate similar or different approaches to these issues or may choose to forego legislation in light of the new FISC orders and the anticipated termination of the TSP while continuing congressional oversight.,Private
The destructive aspects of foreign outsourcing are costly and distressing to those whose jobs are lost to increased imports. Therefore matters of efficiency and equity are intertwined and one of the principal challenges for policymakers in the face of foreign outsourcing (and trade in general) is to find ways to ameliorate the associated harm without sacrificing the economy-wide gains that such trade generates. Compensation for loss and adjustment assistance is thought by economists to offer the best chance for securing higher economic efficiency along with distributional equity.,Private
"The continued rise in China's trade surplus with the United States and the world and complaints from U.S. manufacturing firms and workers over the competitive challenges posed by Chinese imports have led several Members to call for a more aggressive U.S. stance against certain Chinese trade policies they deem to be unfair. Among these is the value of the China's currency (the renminbi or yuan) relative to the dollar. From 1994 to July 2005 China pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar. On July 21 2005 China announced it would let its currency immediately appreciate by 2.1% and link its currency to a basket of currencies (rather than just to the dollar). Although the yuan has appreciated 16% since 2005 many Members complain that China continues to ""manipulate"" its currency in order to gain an unfair trade advantage resulting in U.S. job loss. Numerous bills have been introduced to induce China to adopt a more flexible currency policy.",Private
The current legislative and oversight activity with respect to electronic surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) has drawn national attention to several overarching issues. briefly outlines three such issues and touches upon some of the perspectives reflected in the ongoing debate. These issues include the inherent and often dynamic tension between national security and civil liberties particularly rights of privacy and free speech; the need for the intelligence community to be able to efficiently and effectively collect foreign intelligence information from the communications of foreign persons located outside the United States in a changing fast-paced and technologically sophisticated international environment or from United States persons abroad and the differing approaches suggested to meet this need; and limitations of liability for those electronic communication service providers who furnish aid to the federal government in its foreign intelligence collection. Two constitutional provisions in particular are implicated in this debate - the Fourth and First Amendments. briefly examines these issues and sets them in context.,Private

The international investment position of the United States is an annual measure of the assets Americans own abroad and the assets foreigners own in the United States. The net position or the difference between the two sometimes is referred to as a measure of U.S. international indebtedness. Although this designation is not strictly correct the net international investment position does reveal the difference between the total assets Americans own abroad and total amount of assets foreigners own in the United States. These assets generate flows of capital into and out of the economy that have important implications for the value of the dollar in international exchange markets. Some Members of Congress and some in the public have expressed concerns about the U.S. net international investment position because of the role foreign investors are playing in U.S. capital markets and the potential for large outflows of income and services payments. Some observers also argue that the U.S. reliance on foreign capital inflows leaves the economy vulnerable to financial crises.,Private

The federal budget's return to persistent deficits after fiscal year 2001 increased and continues to increase the amount of federal government debt sold to the public. The sale of U.S. Treasury-issued debt to the public provides the government with the cash it needs to cover the gap between its income and its spending. The Treasury Bulletin (published quarterly) provides data on the amount of federal debt held by different categories of holders. The categories of holders include among others depository institutions individuals pension funds insurance companies state and local governments and foreign governments and international institutions. For this report the holdings of federal debt by the public are divided into just two categories domestic private holdings and foreign and international holdings (hereafter referred to as foreign holdings).

Federal statutes of limitation are as old as federal crimes. When the Founders assembled in the First Congress they passed not only the first federal criminal laws but made prosecution under those laws subject to specific statutes of limitation. Similar provisions continue to this day. Federal capital offenses may be prosecuted at any time but unless some more specific arrangement has been made a general five year statute of limitations covers all other federal crimes. Some of the exceptions to the general rule like those of the USA PATRIOT Act identify longer periods for particular crimes. Others suspend or extend the applicable period under certain circumstances such as the flight of the accused or during time of war.,Private

"The 109th Congress considered H.R. 5068 and S. 3938 both titled the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2006 which would reauthorize the Bank's charter for five years through September 30 2011. The House measure was introduced by Representative Pryce on March 30 2006 and was sent to the House Financial Services Committee which has jurisdiction in the House of Representatives over the Bank. The measure was approved with four amendments by the Committee on June 14 2006 and passed the full House unanimously without amendment on July 26 2006. In the Senate S. 3938 was introduced September 26 2006 by Senator Crapo and sent to the Committee on Banking Housing and Urban Affairs which has jurisdiction.

China officials assert that they have been moving aggressively to improve their food safety system and to close unsafe plants. China in late 2007 concluded a memorandum of agreement with the United States aimed at improving the safety of traded food and feed products. Nonetheless some Members of Congress continue to express sharp criticism of both China's food safety record and U.S. efforts to insure import safety. In the 110th Congress committees on both sides of Capitol Hill held hearings on food safety concerns generally and on the China situation.

U.S. aid to the Palestinians has fluctuated considerably over the past three years largely due to Hamas's changing role within the Palestinian Authority (PA). After Hamas led the PA government for over a year its forcible takeover of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 led to the creation of a non-Hamas government in the West Bank. Since then the U.S. has dramatically boosted aid levels to bolster the PA and President Mahmoud Abbas vis-�-vis Hamas. In FY2008 Congress appropriated a total of $414.5 million in bilateral assistance to the Palestinians the largest single year appropriation ever for the Palestinians. Because of congressional concerns that among other things U.S. funds might be diverted to Palestinian terrorist groups much of this assistance is subject to legislative restrictions. For FY2009 an additional $200 million have already been appropriated for the Palestinians (with another $100 million requested by the Bush Administration). Experts advise that PA stability hinges on now more than ever improved security economic development Israeli cooperation and the continuation of high levels of foreign assistance.,Private
The The House-passed farm bill would have replaced (rather than supplemented) the current federal-state cooperative inspection programs with a new program to enable meat and poultry that is not federally inspected to be shipped across state lines so long as the state programs adopted standards identical to those of USDA along with any additional changes USDA required. The House bill also would have enabled many plants currently under federal inspection to apply for state inspection and continue to ship interstate. Opponents of this change feared that many would seek to opt out of the federal system if they believed that could receive more lenient oversight by the states - an assertion that state proponents dismissed. If the conference farm bill becomes law as many anticipate stakeholders will next turn their attention to USDA where implementation details will be determined through the rulemaking process.,Private
The Interim Cooperative Framework addresses many congressional concerns regarding development in Haiti: promotion of democratic governance and political stability; effective and transparent use of domestic and international funds; and economic development and reduction of poverty.

The nation's trade deficit is equal to the imbalance between national investment and national saving. National saving is the sum of household saving business saving and public sector saving (a budget deficit equals public sector borrowing). In the 2000s the gap between national saving and investment widened largely because of a fall in private and public saving causing the trade deficit to widen. (It fell somewhat in 2007 relative to GDP.) To finance the trade deficit foreign capital must flow into the United States. Net private capital inflows have not grown over this period however to match the widening gap between saving and investment. To finance the growing trade deficit from 2002 through 2007 official capital inflows became increasingly important as central banks in a few Asian and oil-producing countries purchased U.S. assets to moderate or prevent their currencies from appreciating against the dollar. Net official capital inflows were close to $400 billion in 2006 and 2007. If total net capital inflows should decline the dollar and trade deficit would decline U.S. interest rates would rise and U.S. spending on capital goods and consumer durables would fall all else equal.,Private

There are three main avenues for students from other countries to temporarily come to the United States to study and each involves admission as a nonimmigrant. The three visa categories used by foreign students are: F visas for academic study; M visas for vocational study; and J visas for cultural exchange. While most non-immigrants are admitted with visas that have a precise expiration date foreign postsecondary students are admitted for duration of status which lasts as long as they are full-time students or participating according to the terms of their exchange programs.,Private
Several temporary provisions affecting the taxation of capital income were adopted in the 2001-2003 period and further changes may be considered. The 2001 tax cuts provides a phased-in reduction of individual tax rates (typically around three percentage points) which are scheduled to sunset in 2010. The 2002 tax provides bonus depreciation for equipment allowing 30% of investment to be deducted immediately (with the remainder depreciated under standard rules). This bonus depreciation provision was enacted as a temporary stimulus applicable only to acquisitions before 2005. The bonus depreciation share was increased to 50% by the 2003 tax cut. This provision has now expired but it might be considered for reinstatement if fundamental tax reform is considered. Temporary tax reductions on dividends and capital gains received by individuals were also adopted in 2003. The top capital gains tax rate was reduced from 20% to 15% and dividends were also made eligible for these lower tax rates. The 2003 tax cut also accelerated some of the planned individual rate reductions in the 2001 tax cut.,Private
Trade liberalization ultimately results in gains to all economies; however there are winners and losers (both industries and workers) along the way. Worker rights provisions could mitigate the effects of trade liberalization on both groups somewhat by increasing labor costs in developing countries. However the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC) as worker a worker rights promotion vehicle with a developing country has mitigated the effects of trade expansion from NAFTA very little so far because most compliance is voluntary.,Private
The reason for the pending legislation that would alter the current tax code's FSC provisions is FSC's difficulties with the WTO. U.S. trading partners in the EU have argued that FSC is an export subsidy in violation of the WTO agreements and in 1999 a WTO panel supported those claims. looks a U.S. tax laws and how they relate to the WTO agreements.

"provides a current summary of ballistic and cruise missile activity in selected countries and discusses implications for U.S. national security policy. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency's Weapons of Mass Destruction Terms of Reference Handbook defines a ballistic missile as ""a missile that is guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight when the trajectory that it follows is subject only to the external influences of gravity and atmospheric drag"" and a cruise missile as ""a long-range low-flying guided missile that can be launched from air sea and land."" Ballistic and cruise missile development and proliferation continue to pose a threat to U.S. national security interests both at home and abroad. Approximately 35 countries currently possess operational ballistic missiles of various ranges and approximately 25 countries have operational cruise missiles with a range greater than 150 km (90 miles). Some analysts consider cruise missile proliferation to be of more concern than that of ballistic missile proliferation primarily due to their low threshold of use availability affordability and accuracy.",Private

Following amendment an appellate court dismissed one of the earlier cases as moot and remanded the second for reconsideration in light of the amendments. On remand the lower federal court again held the NSLs constitutionally suspect. The decision is on appeal. A report of the Department of Justice's Inspector General found that in its early use of its expanded USA PATRIOT Act authority the FBI had ""used NSLs in violation of applicable NSL statutes Attorney General Guidelines and internal FBI policies"" but that no criminal laws had been broken.

Broad comprehensive data on U.S. multinational companies generally lag behind current events by two years and were not developed to address the issue of jobs outsourcing. Many economists argue however that there is little evidence to date to support the notion that the overseas investment activities of U.S. multinational companies play a significant role in the rate at which jobs are created in the U.S. economy. Instead they argue that the source of job creation in the economy is rooted in the combination of macroeconomic policies the nation has chosen the rate of productivity growth and the availability of resources. addresses these issues by analyzing the extent of direct investment into and out of the economy the role such investment plays in U.S. trade jobs and production and the relationship between direct investment and the broader economic changes that are occurring in the U.S. economy.,Private
"Since 2002 the dollar has depreciated against a broad basket of currencies and against the euro. This depreciation has prompted some observers to question whether the ""cheap"" dollar is leading to a ""fire sale"" of U.S. firms especially of those firms that can be identified as part of the Nation's defense industrial base. Congress has displayed a long and continuing interest in foreign direct investment and its impact on the U.S. economy. Since September 11 2001 Congress has demonstrated a heightened level of concern about the impact of foreign direct investment in critical industries or in sectors that are vital to homeland security. On July 26 2007 the 110th Congress passed P.L. 110-49 (H.R. 556) the National Security Foreign Investment Reform and Strengthened Transparency Act of 2007. The measure reflects a heightened level of concern about the presence of foreign investors in the economy by increasing Congressional oversight over federal reviews of foreign direct investment and by expanding the current areas of review to include homeland security and critical infrastructure. The continued weakness in the exchange value of the dollar and its potential effects on direct investment likely will continue to attract the attention of Members in the second session of the 110th Congress.",Private

A long-running dispute between the United States and the European Union (EU) over U.S. export tax benefits may have reached a conclusion. For more than 30 years U.S. tax law provided a tax benefit to exporters: first as the Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) provisions; then with the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) benefit; and finally with the Extraterritorial Income (ETI) provisions. The EU maintained for virtually the entire period that the U.S. export benefits violated international trade agreements' prohibitions of export subsidies arguing that DISC violated the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and later complaining that FSC and the ETI provisions violated the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements that replaced GATT. Successive attempts by the United States to redesign its export tax benefits so as to achieve legality under GATT and the WTO were not successful; GATT and WTO panels without exception ruled against the U.S. provisions. WTO rulings against the U.S. export benefits culminated in 2002 with the approval of up to $4.03 billion in retaliatory tariffs by the EU. Congress began consideration of legislation to repeal ETI and initially the EU deferred application of its tariffs. By early 2004 however the United States had not enacted repeal legislation and the EU began to phase in its tariffs in March of that year.,Private

National reconciliation has been the primary goal of President Violeta Chamorro's administration since 1990.

"Some policymakers have called for a ""stimulus"" package to boost economic activity in response to the housing downturn. A fundamental difference between stimulus proposals is how much of the stimulus should be composed of government spending and how much should be composed of tax cuts. considers that issue in the context of conventional economic analysis. It first identifies any policy change that increases the budget deficit (or reduces a surplus) and is not entirely saved by the recipient as ""stimulative"" if the economy is operating below its full potential. It then separates the short-run effects of a budget deficit from the long-run effects. In this context certain spending proposals would be more stimulative than certain tax reductions in the short run because they result in a bigger boost in aggregate spending. This advantage may come at the cost of forgone growth in the long run however.",Private

Trends in U.S. foreign assistance to Latin America generally reflect the trends and rationales for U.S. foreign aid programs globally. U.S. assistance spiked in the 1960s during President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress reflecting an interest in preventing the spread of Soviet and Cuban influence in the region and recognizing poverty as one possible root cause of popular discord. In the 1980s the U.S. focus shifted to the Central American isthmus where leftist insurgencies were challenging friendly governments and where a leftist movement in Nicaragua had taken control of government through armed combat. Substantial amounts of U.S. assistance were provided to support Central American governments and the U.S.-backed Contras seeking to overthrow the Sandinista government in Nicaragua. In the aftermath of the 1989 U.S. military intervention in Panama and the 1990 electoral defeat of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua U.S. assistance to these two countries increased substantially. Central America resolved many of its political problems since then although it is still one of the least developed areas in the hemisphere. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 U.S. concerns about spreading communist influence lessened and so too did levels of U.S. assistance. Since 2000 assistance has again increased largely in the Andean region for counternarcotics programs.,Private

This analysis looks at two questions that the policy debate addresses. First what is the impact of the U.S. tax system on the flow of investment abroad? Second what would be the impact of the principal legislative proposals on that flow? It concludes that under current law the tax system poses a patchwork of incentives and disincentives for overseas investment in some cases encouraging U.S. firms to shift operations abroad in some cases discouraging overseas investment. The overall net impact of the system on incentives defines generalization. The current legislative proposals likewise contain a mixture of tax incentives for domestic and foreign investment and whether they would on balance encourage overseas or domestic investment is not clear.,Private
"The foreign tax credit alleviates the double-taxation that would result if U.S. investors' overseas income were to be taxed by both the United States and a foreign country. U.S. taxpayers credit foreign taxes paid against U.S. taxes they would otherwise owe and in doing so concede that the country where income is earned has the primary right to tax that income. But the United States retains the primary right to tax U.S.-source income placing a limit on the foreign tax credit: foreign taxes can only offset the part of a U.S. taxpayer's U.S. tax that falls on foreign source income. It is this limit to which the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-357 Jobs Act) applied. To calculate the limit a firm separates its revenue and costs for tax purposes into those having a foreign source and those having a U.S. source. Foreign taxes can offset U.S. tax on revenue ""sourced"" abroad; in effect foreign-source income is exempt from U.S. tax for firms whose foreign tax credits exceed the limit (firms with ""excess credits""). But because deductions allocated abroad reduce U.S. tax the effect is the same as if deductions allocated to foreign sources can not be claimed for U.S. tax purposes.",Private

There are several reasons why Congress might address the estate tax sooner rather than later. The law governing the estate tax over the next four years is highly erratic. The applicable exclusion amount (popularly known as the exemption) under the estate tax is $2 million for people who die in 2008. The exclusion is scheduled to rise to $3.5 million in 2009. The estate tax is repealed for people who die in 2010 only. Then because the current law governing the estate tax is scheduled to sunset on December 31 2010 the estate tax is set to be reinstated in 2011 with an exclusion of $1 million per person for 2011 and beyond.,Private

"Title VI of the Higher Education Act (HEA P.L. 89-329 as amended) - International Education Programs - authorizes a variety of grants to institutions of higher education (IHEs) and related institutions for the purpose of enhancing instruction in foreign language and area studies (FLAS). This is one of the oldest continuous programs of federal support to higher education having been initiated as Title VI of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 (NDEA P.L. 85-864). It played a historical role of helping to establish along with non-governmental support from certain foundations multi-disciplinary ""area studies"" departments in many colleges and universities especially during the late 1950s and 1960s. Throughout its life the program has also supported courses and programs in less commonly taught languages or world regions.1 The long history of this program reflects the special priority placed by the federal government on FLAS especially with respect to diplomacy national security and trade competitiveness. Interest in HEA Title VI and other federal programs supporting FLAS has increased recently as a result of concerns regarding terrorism arising from foreign regions which are infrequently included in American postsecondary curricula and a related interest in greater expertise in those areas. As with the rest of the HEA Title VI may be considered for reauthorization by the 110th Congress. provides an overview of Title VI programs and an analysis of reauthorization issues.",Private

International trade continues to grow in importance for the world economy as well as the U.S. economy enhancing economic well-being generally but also imposing costs on trade sensitive sectors of national economies.

examines the importance to the U.S. economy of China's investment in U.S. securities as well as U.S. concerns over the possibility that China might unload a large share of those holdings the likelihood that this would occur and the potential implications such action could have for the U.S. economy. The report concludes that a large sell-off of Chinese Treasury securities holdings could negatively affect the U.S. economy at least in the short-run. As a result such a move could diminish U.S. demand for Chinese products and thus could lower China's economic growth as well. The issue of China's large holdings of U.S. securities is part of a broader question that has been raised by many economists: What are the implications of the heavy U.S. reliance on foreign investment to maintain healthy economic growth and to finance the budget deficit?,Private
"There are three basic approaches which are not mutually exclusive to assist greenhouse gasintensive trade-exposed industries: (1) directly supporting domestic industries; (2) penalizing foreign competitors; and (3) developing alternative sectoral approaches. Importantly these are presumably transitional actions pending some international agreement that ""levels the playing field.""",Private
With expanding trade with growing emerging economies that have changing resource endowments the U.S. economy's terms of trade may move as this growth causes changes in the worldwide demand for and supply of the goods and services that the United States exports and imports. Given its current and prospective size China's impact on these forces could be large. China's main impact on the U.S. terms of trade over the last decade has been through the falling price of U.S. imports from China transmitting a favorable impulse to the U.S. terms of trade. It also seems likely that the impact of the economic growth of China on the U.S. terms of trade over the near term will continue to be dominated by the favorable effects of a falling price for imports from China. Over the longer term conclusions are more tentative. Several factors point to a favorable outcome for the United States; however some deterioration of the U.S. terms of trade may be the unavoidable consequence of successful economic development in large emerging economies such as China (as well as India Russia and Brazil). The economic benefit to the world economy from large numbers of people accomplishing the very difficult transformation from poverty to a steadily rising standard of living is great.,Private
The United States has been free of a national debt for only two years 1834 and 1835. In its first year 1790 the country faced a debt of $75 million. From FY1998 to FY2001 the federal government ran budget surpluses. Since then the budget has returned to deficit and the debt had risen to $5 trillion by 2007. It rose to a high of 108.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of World War II; declined to a post-World War II low of 23.8% of GDP in 1974; and then rose to another high of 49.5% of GDP in 1993.,Private
Conventional economic analysis suggests that the cause of the current account deficit is insufficient national saving. Because the U.S. saving rate is too low to finance national demand for physical capital investment the United States must borrow from abroad to bridge the gap. The conventional policy prescription for reducing the current account deficit has been to boost the national saving rate by reducing the budget deficit and encouraging higher rates of private saving.,Private

Laws and regulations have changed significantly since September 2001 and an Information Sharing Executive (ISE) has been established within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to design and implement information sharing procedures. It is clear however that sustaining the exchange of law enforcement and intelligence information remains a challenge. In particular there is continued concern about sharing of information that might in some way jeopardize the rights of free speech or association of U.S. persons. This opposition has contributed to the difficulty Congress has had in addressing legislation in this area and can be expected to continue. Some argue that given the extent of legislation enacted in recent years extensive oversight of information sharing efforts may be an appropriate way to ensure that the balance between ensuring domestic security and protecting civil liberties can be maintained.,Private
"Renewed congressional efforts to codify English as the ""official"" or ""national"" language by statute largely replaced the constitutional amendment approach of earlier years. This trend culminated in 1996 when the House passed H.R. 123 to declare English the official language of the United States government and restricting other linguistic usage in the conduct of ""official"" governmental business. The measure died in the Senate. Contemporary versions of the earlier measure however have appeared in subsequent legislative sessions and similar legislation has been introduced in the 110th Congress. Both H.J.Res. 17 and H.J.Res. 19 would amend the Constitution to establish English as the official language of the United States while H.Con.Res. 11 would resolve that the federal government should pursue policies that not only encourage all residents to become fully proficient in English but also encourage all residents to learn or maintain skills in languages other than English. Meanwhile H.R. 768 would prohibit the enforcement of any executive order that creates an entitlement to services provided in languages other than English while H.R. 769 H.R. 997 S. 1335 and S. 1348 would among other things declare English to be the official language of the United States.",Private

A noticeable phenomenon of the 1980s was the growth in the U.S. trade deficit to record proportions. From a slight surplus in 1980 and 1981 the trade deficit grew to a record 2.5% of GDP in 1986. The trade deficit then declined to a low of about 0.2% of GDP in 1991. It then began to rise reaching a record high of 3.9% of GDP in 2000 the last full year of the 1991-2001 expansion. The growth of the deficit was especially rapid over 1998-2000. During 1998 the deficit was 2.2% of GDP whereas in 1997 it was only 1.1% of GDP. The advent of the recession in 2001 and the subsequent recovery and expansion did not produce a decline in the trade deficit. Rather it continued to rise reaching 5.6% of GDP during 2005 and 5.4% in 2006. (In all of the computations above exports imports the difference between the two and GDP are measured in 2000 dollars.

Most crime is territorial. It is proscribed investigated tried and punished under the law of the place where it occurs. As a general rule no nation's laws apply within the territory of another. Yet in a surprising number of instances federal criminal law does apply overseas whether the accused is an American or a foreign national. As long as there is some nexus to the United States federal law authorizes prosecution - practical diplomatic and procedural impediments notwithstanding.

It begins with a description of the U.S. Social Security policy debate along with a brief comparison of Chile and the United States. Next the report explains what Chile's individual retirement accounts system is and how it works. The pension reform bill sent to the Chilean Congress for debate in 2007 is also discussed. The report does not address other components of Chile's social security system such as maternity work injury and unemployment. The final section provides an assessment of Chile's now 26-year-old individual retirement accounts system. Pension reforms have contributed to the rapid growth in the Chilean economy over the past two decades and returns on pension fund investments have been greater than expected. Administrative costs however have been high and participation rates have been modest at best. There is concern that the system does not cover the entire labor force and provides inadequate benefits to low income workers.,Private

traces out the channels through which the tax cuts are thought to affect the economy and assesses the performance of those economic indicators including gross domestic product (GDP) employment interest rates inflation labor supply saving capital investment and the trade deficit. The report uses theory and data to evaluate the tax cuts' effects through 2004. (does not analyze economic developments since 2004. Presumably individuals had adjusted their behavior to the tax changes by then and economic developments since have not been significantly influenced by tax cuts enacted several years earlier.) The report also offers an overview of the forecasts of their effects made at the time the tax cuts were passed. Most estimates predicted that the tax cuts would increase economic growth in the short-term and reduce it in the long run. Despite the wide diversity of the models used all of the results are relatively small as would be expected of tax cuts that are relatively small in relation to GDP in the years considered.,Private

The path of the dollar is symptomatic of underlying economic forces that shape and propel U.S. international transactions. Of singular importance in this regard is the waxing and waning of the world's appetite for dollar denominated assets and the associated flow of funds on international capital markets. A closer look at the several forces that influence that appetite is revealing of not only the ups and downs of the dollar but also the forces behind the large current account imbalances in the world economy (deficits in the United States and surpluses in other major economies) large asset market imbalances in the world economy (a large stock of liabilities in the United States and a large stock of dollar assets in the investment portfolios of foreigners) and the prospects for an orderly or disorderly correction of those imbalances.,Private

"provides background information regarding the cases of two U.S. citizens deemed ""enemy combatants"" Yaser Esam Hamdi who has been returned to Saudi Arabia and Jose Padilla who remains in military custody. A brief introduction to the law of war pertinent to the detention of different categories of individuals is offered followed by brief analyses of the main legal precedents invoked to support the President's actions as well as Ex parte Milligan which some argue supports the opposite conclusion. A discussion of U.S. practice during wartime to detain persons deemed dangerous to the national security follows including legislative history that may help to shed light on Congress' intent in authorizing the use of force to fight terrorism. The report concludes that historically even during declared wars additional statutory authority has been seen as necessary to validate the detention of citizens not members of any armed forces casting in some doubt the argument that the power to detain persons arrested in a context other than actual hostilities is necessarily implied by an authorization to use force.",Private

A reduced flow of credit will likely dampen economic activity that is dependent on such borrowing as residential investment spending (purchasing new homes) by households business investment spending (purchasing new plant and equipment) and consumer spending (purchasing autos appliances and higher education) by households. Residential investment spending has fallen over 40% between the fourth quarter of 2005 and the third quarter of 2008 and has on average subtracted about 1.0 percentage point from real GDP growth in each of those six quarters. Non-residential investment spending continued to increase in 2007 and the first half of 2008 but the pace fell steadily and in the third quarter of 2008 it declined 0.1%. Consumption expenditures had been increasing but at a decelerating rate in 2007 and the first half of 2008. However in the third quarter of 2008 consumer spending fell 3.1%. A recent study estimates that the decrement to the U.S. economy's supply of credit is about $1 trillion leading to a potential drag on real GDP of about 1.8 percentage points for two years.,Private

examines a small slice of the federal policies influencing pharmaceutical innovation: the federal tax burden on the pharmaceutical industry. The federal tax code affects private investment in new drug discovery and development in a variety of ways and these linkages form the core of the report. More specifically it analyses the industry's federal tax burden from 1995 to 2001 - the most recent year for which federal corporate tax return data are available - focusing on the provisions in the federal tax code that appear to generate significant tax benefits or penalties for pharmaceutical firms that invest heavily in R&D. The size of the industry's tax burden influences its capacity to invest in innovation. The report begins with an examination of the distinguishing traits of the pharmaceutical industry directly related to its tax treatment and concludes with a description of legislative proposals to modify some aspect of this treatment in the 109th Congress.,Private

The rate of long-term economic growth is the salient measure of the nation's ability to steadily advance its material living standard. The pace of long-term economic growth is likely to be a center of attention in the decades just ahead as the U.S. economy confronts the need to undertake unprecedentedly large generational transfers of income to pay for the retirement of the huge baby-boom generation as well as large transfers to the rest of the world to meet the debt service costs of the United States' large and still growing foreign debt.,Private
Most capital offenses are state crimes. In 1994 however Congress revived the death penalty as a federal sentencing option. More than a few federal statutes now proscribe offenses punishable by death. A number of bills were offered during the 110th Congress to modify federal law in the area. None were enacted. One S. 447 (Senator Feingold)/H.R. 6875 (Representative Kucinich) would have abolished the federal death penalty. Another H.J.Res. 80 (Rep McCollum) would have amended the Constitution to abolish capital punishment as a sentencing alternative for either state or federal crimes. Other proposed amendments would have eased constitutional limitations on the death penalty as a sentencing option particularly in cases involving the rape of children H.J.Res. 83 (Representative Broun) H.J.Res. 96 (Representative Chabot).,Private

"Manufacturing seems to be a steadily diminishing presence in the American economy producing a falling share of Gross National Product and employing a smaller share of the labor force. Many see this as a loss of something vital to providing ""good"" jobs and advancing economic well being. On the other hand deindustrialization has occurred in varying degrees in most industrial economies and can be seen as a natural outcome of economic progress and a rising living standard. When examined from the standpoint of real output and level of employment the U.S. manufacturing sector has shown considerable stability over the last 20 years. Because the apparent deindustrialization has been coincident with a rising level of international trade particularly recent increases in trade with many low-wage developing economies there is an inclination to see causality running from rising trade to a faltering manufacturing sector. Yet economic analysis indicates that while a rising level of trade can have adverse consequences for particular industries it is unlikely to adversely affect the whole manufacturing sector. Increased imports may hurt some industries but the increased exports needed to pay for those imports helps other industries. Therefore across all tradeable goods producing industries there is no net loss of jobs. Moreover exporting industries tend to pay higher wages than import competing industries.",Private
Economics tells us that a nation exports so that it may import. Exports are the cost goods and services the domestic economy must give up while imports are the benefit foreign goods and services that we wish to acquire in trade. Clearly the nation is better off if for any given volume of imports it exchanges a smaller volume of exports rather than a larger volume. The nations terms of trade is a measure of the export cost of acquiring desired imports. Increases and decreases in its terms of trade indicate whether a nations gains from trade is rising or falling. While trade is a process of mutual beneficial exchange each trading partners share of those benefits can change over time and movement of the terms of trade are an indicator of that changing share.,Private

Over the past 15 years the U.S. current account has moved from a small surplus to a deficit that in 2005 was nearly $800 billion. The final tally for 2006 has not been completed but preliminary data suggests the deficit will grow to near $900 billion. The current account deficit has increased also as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) climbing from near zero to a record 6.2% in 2005. Because a current account deficit is a reflection of a concurrent net inflow of borrowed funds from the rest of the world the accumulation of debt from a long succession of large annual deficits has caused the United States to move from being a small net creditor to the rest of the world to being a large net debtor. The net accumulation of liabilities through 2005 is $2.7 trillion which is equivalent to about 22% of U.S. GDP.,Private
One reason that Social Security reform is on the congressional agenda is the large projected long-term fiscal shortfall facing Social Security estimated at an average of 0.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) between now and 2080. But relatively little attention has been given to the potential long-term shortfall faced by the rest of the government which is estimated to be more than 6.5 times larger than Social Security's shortfall. The government's overall fiscal gap under an extension of current policy estimated at an average of 7.2% of GDP between now and 2080 is the result of the large projected increase in future spending that is not matched by any projected increase in tax revenue. Most of the increase in spending occurs in Medicare and Medicaid; Social Security is the third largest contributor to the fiscal gap. If viewed from the revenue side the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts increased the fiscal gap by an average of 2.2% of GDP between now and 2080. The fiscal gap measure may be useful to policymakers because it highlights the unsustainability of current policy in the long term and the potential cost of inaction and it provides a measure that can be used to estimate the implications of current policy for the macroeconomy and generational equity.,Private

"Recently the critics have urged that the multiple policy goals of the Federal Reserve (Fed) be replaced by a single goal of price stability. Critics believe that central bankers tend to use their discretionary powers to achieve political as well as economic objectives notably to create ""good times"" through monetary expansion. Since these ""good times"" do not last long such a policy imparts a costly inflationary bias to an economy and hence is not economically optimal over time. Among other virtues it is argued that a single goal would provide an explicit anchor for the American monetary system.",Private

Several members of the European Union (EU) over the past two years have been erecting barriers to cross-border mergers and acquisitions possibly in violation of their Single Market commitments. The main focus of these anti-competitive actions often dubbed economic nationalism or economic patriotism by the press is on corporate control particularly in the banking steel and energy sectors. Unlike in the 1980s when the main opposition to creation of the Single Market for goods capital labor and services came from companies resistant to being exposed to more international competition the main opposition to liberalization today comes from some member state governments (and or politicians) fearful of losing national prestige and jobs as a result of merger activity. examines the nature and significance of rising economic nationalism as well as how U.S. interests may be affected.,Private

Implementation of the security screening opt-out provision is likely to be an issue of considerable interest during the remainder of the 108th Congress. While privatization advocates are calling for an expansion of the opt-out provision to allow for greater program flexibility and less federal control of private airport screening advocates for federal control of aviation security view a return to private screening as a move that could reintroduce deficiencies in aviation security that existed before the federalization of passenger screening under ATSA.,Private
Many Members of Congress charge that China's policy of accumulating foreign reserves (especially U.S. dollars) to influence the value of its currency constitutes a form of currency manipulation intended to make its exports cheaper and imports into China more expensive than they would be under free market conditions. They further contend that this policy has caused a surge in the U.S. trade deficit with China and has been a major factor in the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs. Although China made modest reforms to its currency policy in 2005 resulting in a modest appreciation of its currency many Members contend the reforms have not gone far enough and have warned of potential legislative action.,Private
For security and other reasons the President Vice President and First Lady use military aircraft when they travel. The White House generally categorizes the trips as fulfilling either official or political functions. Often a trip involves both official and political or unofficial activities. When a trip is for an official function the government pays all costs including per diem (food and lodging) car rentals and other incidental expenses. When a trip is for political or unofficial purposes those involved must pay for their own food and lodging and other related expenses and they must also reimburse the government with the equivalent of the airfare that they would have paid had they used a commercial airline. When a trip involves both official and political activities a formula determines the amount to be reimbursed for that part of the trip involving political activities. Whether a trip is for official or political purposes the Air Force pays all operational and other costs incurred by the use of the aircraft. While the travel policies of specific Administrations concerning the reimbursement of expenses for unofficial travel generally are not publicly available it appears that policy guidelines developed by the Reagan White House have served as a basis for the travel policies of subsequent Administrations.,Private

Open source information (OSINT) is derived from newspapers journals radio and television and the Internet. Intelligence analysts have long used such information to supplement classified data but systematically collecting open source information has not been a priority of the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC).

Increasing border and transportation security are essential strategies for improving and maintaining homeland security. Border security entails regulating the flow of goods and people across the nation's borders so that dangerous and unwanted goods or people are detected and denied entry. Transportation security entails screening and protecting people and goods as they move between different locations within the country. Determining which goods and people are permitted and which are denied entry into the United States involves a system of sophisticated border management. This system must balance the need for securing the nation's borders with facilitating the essential commerce and legitimate free flow of citizens and authorized visitors. The system must be capable of a detailed examination of the goods and people seeking entry but must still fit within budgetary constraints and be administratively feasible. Improving transportation security has meant an expanded federal role in screening passengers and baggage traveling through airports and also increasing the presence of federal officers aboard domestic and international flights. Plans exist to expand the presence of federal officers in other modes of transportation. Finally these management systems must accomplish their functions with a minimum of disruption of legitimate activities and without unnecessary intrusion into the civil liberties of persons affected by them.,Private

In the process of arguing its position at the WTO Japan made representations that its market for photographic film and paper is open.

After the repeated urging of the Department of Energy (DOE) Congress in 2006 agreed to temporarily consolidate separate counterintelligence (CI) offices at the Department of Energy and the National Security Administration (NNSA) into a single CI office under DOE control. DOE had complained that the dual office structure was ineffective. In permitting DOE to consolidate the two offices Congress reversed its 1999 authorization to establish a separate NNSA CI office-a decision that at the time was prompted by congressional concerns over repeated departmental security and counterintelligence lapses. At the same time in 2006 DOE combined its separate Offices of Intelligence and Counterintelligence into a new DOE office called the Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence. The Department reasoned that combining the disciplines of counterintelligence and foreign intelligence under one integrated office would foster synergistic cooperation that would lead to a more strategic and ultimately more effective counterintelligence program. analyzes both consolidations-the first authorized by Congress at DOE's request; the second initiated by DOE-and examines the impact of each on the effectiveness of the Department's CI program. A major oversight issue for Congress is whether either or both organizational changes will strengthen the Department's CI program as intended. Some observers are concerned that the two consolidations may have undercut CI capabilities.,Private

Federal mandatory minimum sentencing statutes (mandatory minimums) demand that execution or incarceration follow criminal conviction. Among other things they cover drug dealing murdering federal officials and using a gun to commit a federal crime. They have been a feature of federal sentencing since the dawn of the Republic. They circumscribe judicial sentencing discretion although they impose few limitations upon prosecutorial discretion or upon the President's power to pardon. They have been criticized as unthinkingly harsh and incompatible with a rational sentencing guideline system; yet they have also been embraced as hallmarks of truth in sentencing and a certain means of incapacitating the criminally dangerous. is an overview of federal statutes in the area and a discussion of some of the constitutional challenges they have faced.,Private

A recurring question in the debate on adding individual accounts (IAs) to Social Security is how large the typical account would be upon retirement. Making this calculation requires assumptions about the contribution rate length of time the account was held and rate of return earned on the account (net any administrative fees and taxes). Because of the power of compound interest changing the rate of return on the account leads to greatly different outcomes. For example $1 invested every month for 40 years accumulates to $1526 if earning 5% $2625 if earning 7% and $4681 if earning a 9% rate of return. Many estimates of how large the IAs would be have assumed that assets in the account would earn a rate of return equal to the historical average. For example in the official actuarial estimates of various IA plans the Social Security Administration actuaries assume that equities will average a rate of return of 6.5% and government bonds will earn 3%. Some proposals assume that the accounts would hold equities (stocks) others bonds and others some combination of the two. Since stocks historically have a higher rate of return than bonds on average the rate of return earned by the IA's would increase as the fraction held in equities increased. But is the assumption that future rates of return will mirror historical rates of return a valid one? Or are there ways in which the future may differ from the past that will have a predictable effect on the rate of return? analyzes demographic economic and financial reasons why the assumption might or might not be valid.,Private

The purpose of this report is to outline the commonalities and potential differences between EO 13354 and P.L. 108-458 as these conceptual differences could be meaningful in the implementation process of P.L. 108-458 and/or should the issue of intelligence reform be re-visited by the 109th Congress. The report examines some aspects of the law related to the NCTC including the relationship between the NCTC's Director and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) which may have implications related to policy and implementation of an effective and efficient nationally coordinated counterterrorism function. Moreover the report examines several issues that may be of interest to Congress as the NCTC matures and evolves including potential civil liberties implications of collocating operational elements of the traditional foreign intelligence and domestic intelligence entities of the U.S. Intelligence Community. While the appointment and confirmation of a DNI may resolve some of the uncertainty regarding the NCTC the NCTC is only one of a myriad of complex issues that will be competing for the time and attention of the recently nominated DNI. An issue for Congress is whether to let the existing intelligence reform law speak for itself (and let certain ambiguities be resolved during implementation) or to intervene to address apparent ambiguities through amendments to the law now. Alternatively the executive branch may choose to intervene to clarify apparent ambiguities within P.L. 108-458 or between EO 13354 and P.L. 108-458.,Private

New issues of the 30-year Treasury bond were discontinued in November 2001 based on budget projections at the time that the publicly held national debt would be retired within a matter of years. It was reasoned at the time that it would not be in the nation's interest to issue debt that would still be outstanding after the national debt had been retired and the budget had entered a period of sustained surplus. The drawbacks to discontinuing the 30-year bond were seen to be insignificant. The Treasury also discontinued other maturities such as the 20-year bond and the 3-year note in the surplus years in order to increase liquidity in the remaining maturities as borrowing needs dwindled. Since then the projections of large surpluses have been transformed into large deficits. On August 3 2005 the Treasury announced that the 30-year bond would be reintroduced in the first quarter of 2006. To evaluate the merits of this change it is useful to consider how the reintroduction of the 30-year bond would affect the cost of government borrowing the macroeconomy and the efficiency of financial markets. Before doing so it is useful to define the goals of Treasury debt management.,Private

The Administration and Congress agree on the need to invest in science and engineering research and science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) education in order for the United States to be more competitive with other nations. Their priorities as to which programs to fund and how much however are different. When Congress passed the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology Education and Science Act (P.L. 110-69) known as the America COMPETES Act in August 2007 much of the FY2008 appropriations debate had already taken place. As a consequence FY2008 appropriations largely failed to address the new priorities enacted in the America COMPETES Act.

Over the last decade or so concern about illegal immigration has sporadically led to a re-examination of a long-established tenet of U.S. citizenship codified in the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and �301(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. �1401(a)) that a person who is born in the United States subject to its jurisdiction is a citizen of the United States regardless of the race ethnicity or alienage of the parents. The war on terror and the case of Yaser Esam Hamdi a U.S.-Saudi dual national captured in Afghanistan fighting with Taliban forces further heightened attention and interest in restricting automatic birthright citizenship after the revelation that Hamdi was a U.S. citizen by birth in Louisiana to parents who were Saudi nationals in the United States on non-immigrant work visas and arguably entitled to rights not available to foreign enemy combatants. traces the history of this principle under U.S. law and discusses some of the legislation in recent Congresses intended to alter it.,Private

Recently enacted statutes mandate better integration of ISR capabilities and require that the Defense Department prepare a roadmap to guide the development and integration of ISR capabilities over the next fifteen years. An effective roadmap if developed could potentially ensure more comprehensive coverage of targets and save considerable sums of money. To establish responsibility for an Intelligence Community-wide effort the 9/11 Commission recommended that a new position of Director of National Intelligence be established to manage the national intelligence program (but not joint military and tactical intelligence programs which would continue to be managed by the Defense Department). This position was included after extended debate in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) that was approved by the President on December 17 2004. The implications of this legislation for ISR programs are as yet uncertain but Congress may seek to assess the effectiveness of the statute in addressing long-existing concerns with ISR programs.,Private

The Before the USA PATRIOT Act federal authorities engaged in gathering foreign intelligence information or conducting an investigation of international terrorism could seek a FISA court order for access to hotel airline storage locker and car rental business records. Section 215 amended the procedure so that in a foreign intelligence or international terrorism investigation federal authorities may obtain a FISA order for access to any tangible item no matter who holds it including by implication library loan records and the records of library computer use. Although past practices have apparently made the library community apprehensive the extent to which the authority of Section 215 has been used if at all is unclear. Media accounts of federal investigations involving library patrons ordinarily do not distinguish between simple inquiries grand jury subpoenas criminal search warrants FISA physical search orders and FISA tangible item orders.

The issue that has received the most attention in post-Katrina discussions is the speed of rescue and relief operations. The Department of Defense's (DOD's) Northern Command began its alert and coordination procedures before Katrina's landfall; however many deployments did not reach the affected area until days later. An examination of the timeline of DOD's response and the decision points along that timeline could provide insight into whether the response could have been accelerated given the intensity of the storm and the extent of the destruction. Both the National Response Plan and DOD's own Homeland Security Doctrine lay out extensive procedures and specific decision points in an attempt to ensure an organized response to catastrophic incidents. It may now be necessary to examine those procedures and the actions of responsible authorities to determine whether procedural obstacles administrative failures or both delayed the arrival of needed resources in the affected area. The traditional assumption that the Department of Defense is the resource only of last resort may also require reexamination.,Private
Some in Congress and the executive branch have not been content with the changes being undertaken by the states and several proposals have been put forth over the past few years for increased federal involvement in insurance regulation.

These changes prohibit the Bank from providing loans or guarantees for exports of goods primarily capital equipment that foreign firms can use to increase their production of goods that are substantially the same as products that are subject to a countervailing or antidumping duty order under title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 or a determination under title II (escape clause relief) of the Trade Act of 1974. The Bank is also required to develop a set of policies regarding exports of equipment that foreign firms can use in the production of items that are subject to a preliminary rather than a final injury determination.

Increasingly efforts to protect integral features of the natural environment that are essential to human well being face a double challenge. First the magnitude of some conventional and emerging threats to environmental quality is growing despite solid progress in controlling some causes. This is particularly the concern on a global scale in terms of atmospheric changes and loss of biological diversity. Second easily-implemented uniform control methods using feasible technologies or other direct regulatory approaches are already in place for many pollution and resource management problems in the United States. Additional progress with so-called command and control policies can be expensive and disruptive and thus counter productive to overall economic well being. This type of dilemma is common where environmental deterioration results from diffuse and complex causes inherent in technically-advanced high-consumption industrial societies such as the U.S. Solutions to these types of environmental problems are complicated by the diffuse benefits which obscures the net gains of additional controls that have concentrated and highly visible costs. Given this double bind many policy analysts and academics have for years advocated more cost-effective and flexible approaches relying on market forces to further some environmental management objectives. Although market-based theory and practical environmental policy are still far apart the incremental approach to environmental policymaking since the late seventies has resulted in some market-type innovations within traditional regulatory frameworks at all levels of government. The most prominent examples are the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) air emissions trading program and the recently enacted sulfur dioxide allowance trading program under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.,Private
Although seafood consumption can contribute to a healthy diet some fish and shellfish can cause foodborne illnesses or contain environmental contaminants.

In the early 1990s Sweden faced a banking and exchange rate crisis that led it to rescue banks that had experienced large losses on their balance sheets and that threatened a collapse of the banking system. Some analysts and others argue that Sweden's experience could provide useful lessons for the execution and implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 20081. The banking crisis facing the United States is unique so there are no exact parallels from which to draw templates. Sweden's experience however represents a case study in how a systemic banking crisis was resolved in a developed country with democratic institutions. The Swedish central bank separated out good assets which it left to the banks to oversee from bad assets which it placed in a separate agency with broad authority to work out debt problems or to liquidate assets. Four lessons that emerged form Sweden's experience are: 1) the process must be transparent; 2) the resolution agency must be politically and financially independent; 3) market discipline must be maintained; and 4) there must be a plan to jump-start credit flows in the financial system. provides an overview of the Swedish banking crisis and an explanation of the measures Sweden used to restore its banking system to health.,Private

On August 16 2004 President Bush unveiled one of the most sweeping changes to the numbers and locations of military overseas basing facilities since the beginning of the Cold War. Announcing a plan that had been under study for approximately three years the Department of Defense would move thousands of personnel from installations in Europe and Asia to bases within the United States. Simultaneously the military would shift its approach away from huge bases such as Ramstein Air Force Base which has all of the comforts of the U.S. - family housing supermarkets convenience stores theaters and so forth to reliance on more austere facilities in Central Asia Africa and the Middle East that would be less elaborate and lack most of these benefits. In 2004 the Congress chartered the Commission on the Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States (also known as the Overseas Basing Commission) to provide an independent assessment of the DOD overseas basing needs.1 The DOD plan could prompt budget and oversight decisions for the second session of the 109th Congress. These might include approval modification or rejection of the DOD proposal. Congress could also have to consider appropriations requests for construction of infrastructure at new overseas or expanded continental United States (CONUS) locations as well as fund increased impact aid to local communities. Congress would have to oversee new acquisition programs for mobility and logistics capabilities (such as airlift) needed for the strategy. Congress may also consider whether the plan will be executable given the results of the 2005 round of the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. Finally the Senate may consider new or revised treaties with new basing partners submitted for its advice and consent.,Private
"Some U.S. producers of merchandise subject to antidumping (AD) duties or countervailing duties (CVD) complain that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have not collected the full amount of duties owed on targeted imports. One of the ""loopholes"" often cited is a law that allows importers that receive goods from new exporters of targeted merchandise to post bonds instead of cash deposits while an investigation of the ""new shipper"" is conducted to assess an appropriate AD or CVD duty amount based on the exporter's previous sales.

compares aggregate data on U.S. assistance to Iraq through FY2006 with U.S. assistance to Germany and Japan during the seven years following World War II. U.S. aid allocations (all grant assistance) for Iraq appropriated from 2003 through 2006 total $35.7 billion. About $11.8 billion (33%) went for economic infrastructure assistance. The remaining $23.8 billion was targeted at bolstering Iraqi security ($15.5 billion) and traditional political social and economic reform assistance ($8.3 billion). A higher proportion of Iraqi aid has been provided for economic reconstruction of critical infrastructure than was the case for Germany and Japan. Total U.S. assistance to Iraq thus far is about a fifth more than total assistance (adjusted for inflation) provided to Germany - and somewhat more than double that provided to Japan - from 1946-1952.,Private

"The ""War Powers Act of 1933"" is a name given by some members of the militia and patriot movement to emergency banking legislation passed in 1933 five days after President Roosevelt came into office. It has apparently been so labeled by some because the banking legislation amended the ""Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917"" in order to give legal underpinning to President Roosevelt's efforts to cope with the banking crisis. It is alleged by its modern-day critics that by that amendment the government in effect declared war on the American people and began a reign of unconstitutional rule through President emergency powers. These allegations overlook the facts that the amendment of the Trading with the Enemy Act has subsequently been repealed but the powers exercised pursuant to President Roosevelt's proclamation of national emergency have been terminated and that the President's exercise of emergency powers is now regulated under the ""National Emergencies Act.""",Private

International pressure on Iran to curb its nuclear program is increasing the hesitation of major foreign firms to invest in Iran's energy sector hindering Iran's efforts to expand oil production beyond 4.1 million barrels per day. Iran continues to attract preliminary energy investment interest from firms primarily in Asia. The formal U.S. effort to curb energy investment in Iran began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) although no firms have been sanctioned under it and the precise effects of that law on energy investment in Iran has been unclear.

States are now the primary regulator of insurers. Some insurers joined by some banks with insurance affiliates believe that current state insurance regulation hinders their effective competition with other financial intermediaries. Congress has several interests in any examination of state insurance regulation. In the 1945 McCarran-Ferguson Act it ceded that insurance regulatory authority to the states but it also committed to assessing the effectiveness of this regulation. Another is to assess the marketplace after the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which dramatically revised regulation for most of the financial services industry but left insurance regulation essentially unchanged. The objective of this report is to frame these issues in their historical and substantive contexts. The frame will have several parts. One is that insurance regulation developed at the state level largely because most companies were local. A second is that until 1945 the courts said that Congress did not have the constitutional authority to regulate insurance. Third since the 1950s Congress and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) have been engaged in a ongoing dialogue about the nature and quality of state regulation which has led both to the substantial growth of the NAIC and to increasing federal legislative involvement in insurance regulation. Fourth insurance is now regulated at both the state and national level.,Private

As the 111th Congress convenes economic stimulus activity through new spending and tax cuts will likely be of primary concern. Proposals that have been mentioned include the extension of bonus depreciation suspension of rules requiring withdrawals from individual retirement accounts an employee wage credit and the suspension of taxes on unemployment benefits. Measures to reduce the budget deficit-such as raising taxes on higher income individuals-may not be introduced in 2009. Instead it is possible that the reductions of the top tax rates created in 2001 would be allowed to expire at the start of 2011. Later in the 111th Congress after any economic stimulus measures are perceived to be taking effect other tax policy issues may be addressed. Policies that may be addressed include the alternative minimum tax changes in marginal individual income tax rates estate taxes corporate income tax rates and capital gains rates; and the taxation of small business.

Rising procurement costs for Navy ships are a matter of concern for both Navy officials and Members of Congress who track Navy-related issues. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that executing a 30-year Navy shipbuilding plan submitted to Congress in early 2006 may require annual funding levels about 33% higher than the Navy plans and about 76% more than the Navy has received on average in recent years. Combined with constraints on shipprocurement funding rising ship procurement costs have caused the Navy in recent years to reduce planned ship procurement rates. Some Members of Congress have expressed concern about the effects these reduced rates would have on the future size of the Navy and on the shipyards that build the Navy's ships. The issue for Congress is how to respond to rising Navy ship procurement costs. Congress's decisions on this issue could affect future Navy capabilities Navy funding requirements and the shipbuilding industrial base.,Private

In 1998 a U.S. district court held that the imposition of the coal excise tax or black lung excise tax on exported coal was unconstitutional. Refunding the tax has been controversial. This is because some coal producers and exporters attempted to bypass the limitations in the Internal Revenue Code's refund scheme by bringing suit under the Export Clause in the Court of Federal Claims seeking damages from the United States in the amount of coal excise taxes paid. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals held there was Tucker Act jurisdiction to hear some of the suits and allowed them as an alternative to the Code's refund process. However in a 2008 decision United States v. Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co. the Supreme Court held that taxpayers must comply with the Code's refund process. Meanwhile several bills would provide an alternative method for coal excise tax refunds including the amended version of H.R. 6049 (Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008) that was passed by the Senate on September 23 2008 and H.R. 7060 (Renewable Energy and Job Creation Tax Act of 2008) which was passed by the House on September 26 2008.,Private

The 107th Congress enacted a variety of immigration-related laws. The Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296) reorganizes the federal government with the creation of a new Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security.

According to the President's budget request in FY2008 funds from a reauthorized MDUFMA would account for an estimated $47.5 million and 200 full-time equivalent employees (FTEs). This would comprise 16.6% of FDA's medical device review budget authority and 13.0% of its medical device review-related FTEs. While these numbers and percentages are not as high as those projected for collection under a similar FDA user fee authority related to prescription drugs (pursuant to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act) they are significant.,Private
With the U.S. committed to implementing NAFTA most ongoing issues of interest to Congress once Public Citizen v. DOT is resolved are issues of oversight. The most immediate issues is oversight of implementation on the U.S. side of the border within the context of U.S. treaty obligations and the safety enforcement preconditions Congress set forth in the FY2002 DOT Appropriations Act. Mexican implementation may become a major oversight issue. The Mexican government as of this writing has neither accepted applications by U.S. firms to operate in Mexico nor set forth the regulations for doing so. Other oversight issues include whether the role of Mexican customs brokers and drayage operators in cross-border trade is a barrier against U.S. trucking firms; the possible illegal operation of Mexican trucks beyond their operating authority in the United States; and the leasing of Mexican trucks and drivers by U.S. firms for use in the United States.,Private

As the 110th Congress debates immigration control (i.e. border security and interior enforcement) and legal reform (i.e. temporary and permanent admissions) concerns arise over the capacity of the Department of Homeland Security to identify and remove temporary aliens who fail to depart when their visas expire. It is estimated that each year hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals overstay their nonimmigrant visas or enter the country illegally (with fraudulent documents or bypassing immigration inspections). The most recent published estimate based upon the March Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS) is that 11.1 million unauthorized aliens were residing in the United States in 2005.2 Reliable estimates of the number of nonimmigrant overstays are not available and sample estimates range from 31% to 57% of the unauthorized population (depending on methodology).,Private

If housing prices were being driven by a bubble there is a chance that they could suddenly collapse with adverse effects on the U.S. economy. Residential investment which rose 9% annually in 2003-2005 fell by 9.8% in 2006:2. It remains to be seen if this decline is the beginning of a broader trend. A decline in housing wealth could also depress consumption thereby depressing aggregate spending in the short run. A sudden collapse in housing prices could also affect the health of the financial sector if financial institutions are not adequately safeguarded. All of these possibilities give Congress a cause for concern yet effective policy responses to a bubble are difficult. If house prices were to decline in some regions it would not be the first time this occurred. The report examines previous price declines in California New England and Texas.

The Navy's proposed FY2009 budget did not request funding for a 10th LPD-17 and instead proposed ending LPD-17 procurement with the ninth ship which was procured in FY2008. The Navy's planned 313-ship fleet calls for a 31-ship amphibious force that includes 10 LPD-17s and the Marine Corps states that a 33-ship amphibious force that includes 11 LPD-17s would be required to fully meet the Marine Corps' amphibious lift goal.,Private
Both the House and the Senate have passed comprehensive legislation to reauthorize existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) programs and expand the agency's authority to ensure the safety of prescription drugs medical devices and biologics. The Senate passed the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act (S. 1082) on May 9 2007. The House passed the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (H.R. 2900) on July 11 2007. At its core the legislation renews authority for two key user fee programs that are set to expire on October 1 2007: the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA; P.L. 107-188) and the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act (MDUFMA; P.L. 107-250). These account for 87% of FDA's user fee revenue and 19% of FDA's total FY2008 program level budget. Without the reauthorizations and absent a substantial increase in FDA's annual appropriations the agency would lose a significant source of funding. FDA had warned that a failure to reauthorize the user fee programs before August 1 2007 would require the agency to issue layoff notices but the agency has reportedly forestalled that necessity by switching to reserve funds.,Private

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) enacted on August 8 2005 expanded some of the existing tax subsidies for the oil and gas industry and created several new ones.

The industry also benefits from provisions of current tax law that are not strictly tax subsidies (or tax expenditures) but that nevertheless provide advantages for and reduce effective tax rates of the oil and gas industry. The remainder of this report discusses these tax provisions in detail. The first section below discusses the origin and evolution of the oil and gas tax subsidies that were incorporated into the 2005 act. The second section summarizes each of the oil and gas tax subsidy provisions in the 2005 energy act and reports its corresponding revenue loss estimate. Section three describes other oil and gas tax subsidies those that existed before EPACT05 and were generally not affected by it. The final section describes several tax provisions that benefit the oil and gas industry; these are not tax subsidies per se - they are not considered to be tax expenditures - but are deemed by some observers to confer excessive (or unfair) benefits for the industry.,Private

Congress has several options for responding to recent proposals for procuring DOD ships and aircraft with funding mechanisms that do not conform to the full funding policy. These options could have the effect of terminating modifying maintaining or strengthening the full funding policy. In weighing these options Congress may consider several factors including Congress's power of the purse its ability to conduct oversight of DOD procurement programs the impact on future Congresses DOD budgeting discipline and the potential impact on weapon costs. The process of weighing options may involve balancing a need to meet DOD procurement goals within available funding against the goal of preserving Congress's control over DOD spending and its ability to conduct oversight of DOD programs.,Private

While the social security number (SSN) was first introduced as a device for keeping track of contributions to the Social Security system its use has been expanded by government entities and the private sector to keep track of many other government and private sector records. Use of the social security number as a federal government identifier was based on Executive Order 9393 issued by President Franklin Roosevelt. Beginning in the 1960s federal agencies started adopting the social security number as a governmental identifier and its use for keeping track of government records on both the federal and state levels greatly increased. Section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974 limits compulsory divulgence of the social security number by government entities. While the Privacy Act does provide some limits on the use of the social security number by state and federal entities exceptions provided in that statute and succeeding statutes have resulted in only minimal restrictions on governmental usage of the social security number. Constitutional challenges to social security number collection and dissemination have for the most part been unsuccessful. Private sector use of the social security number is widespread and continues to be largely unregulated by the federal government. The chronology in this report provides a list of federal developments affecting use of the social security number including federal regulation of the number as well as specific authorizations restrictions and fraud provisions concerning its use.,Private

During the nineteen-year occupation U.S. military and civilian officials numbering less than 2500 for the most part supervised the collection of taxes and the disbursement of revenues maintained public order and initiated a program of public works. The Haitian government remained in place but was subject to U.S. guidance. The Haitian people benefitted from the end of endemic political violence and from the construction of roads bridges and ports as well as from improved access to health care. The U.S. occupation was nonetheless deeply resented throughout Haitian society and many of its accomplishments did not long endure its termination in 1934.,Private

analyzes the factors that determine the cost of electricity from new power plants. These factors - including construction costs fuel expense environmental regulations and financing costs - can all be affected by government energy environmental and economic policies. Government decisions to influence or not influence these factors can largely determine the kind of power plants that are built in the future. For example government policies aimed at reducing the cost of constructing power plants could especially benefit nuclear plants which are costly to build. Policies that reduce the cost of fossil fuels could benefit natural gas plants which are inexpensive to build but rely on an expensive fuel. The report provides projections of the possible cost of power from new fossil nuclear and renewable plants built in 2015 illustrating how different assumptions such as for the availability of federal incentives change the cost rankings of the technologies.,Private

Throughout its history the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) which was once envisioned as a for-profit corporation has failed to achieve a profit and has needed to rely on annual federal subsidies for its survival. Despite this there has been enough support in Congress and at times also in the White House to provide just enough subsidies to keep Amtraks trains running. There has not however been enough federal and state financial support for Amtrak as a money losing (some would add at least at times mismanaged) operation to develop its routes into the robust national network that intercity passenger rail advocates had hoped for. That Amtrak has teetered on the edge of a shutdown many times only to be saved by federal subsidies raises the questions of why and to whom a national intercity rail network matters.,Private

"Federal law promises criminal defendants a proper venue i.e. trial in the district in which the federal crime was committed. A crime is committed in any district in which any of its ""conduct"" elements are committed. Some offenses are committed entirely within a single district; there they must be tried. Others begin in one district and are completed in another. They may be tried where they occur unless Congress has limited the choice of venue for the particular offense. Conspiracy may be tried in any district in which an overt act in its furtherance is committed at least when the commission of an overt act is an element of the conspiracy statute at issue. Crimes committed beyond the territorial confines of the United States are usually tried in the district into which the accused is first brought.

The federal government affects the supply and demand of various agricultural goods through farm income support and food donation programs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides payments to farmers and landowners for producing certain program commodities. Ranking commodities by the level of support depends on the criteria and time period. Over FY2003-FY2005 USDA expects to spend about $11 billion annually on farm payments. In total outlays feed grains receive the most support (29% of the total) followed by wheat dairy and cotton (15%-18% each). However using different criteria based on the proportion of crop revenue from government payments rice peanuts and wool and mohair receive a higher percentage of revenue from the government (42%-51%) than cotton wheat and feed grains (12%-25%). USDA also purchases some of these program commodities and other non-program commodities and processed products for use in domestic and international food aid programs. In FY2003 USDA purchased commodities totaling $1.5 billion for domestic food assistance and $1.3 billion for international food aid. Beef was the most purchased commodity for domestic programs (15% of the total) followed by cheese (14%) and chicken (9%). The child nutrition and school lunch programs were significant users of these commodities. Wheat is the most-purchased commodity for international food aid programs (33%).,Private

In recent years numerous studies have addressed various concerns and provided recommendations regarding U.S. foreign aid policy funding and structure. Views range from general approval of the F process as a first step toward better coordination of aid programs and the need to build on it to strong criticism of the creation of the F Bureau its inadequacy in coordinating or reforming much of what is wrong with foreign aid and the need to replace it with a cabinet-level department of foreign aid. While the 14 studies surveyed by the Congressional Research Service (CRS) emphasize different aspects of the importance of U.S. foreign assistance all agree that foreign assistance must be reformed to improve its effectiveness. Of the 16 recommendation categories CRS identifies only enhancing civilian agency resources has the support of all of the studies covered in this report.

"At several meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin President George W. Bush stated that his administration will work with the Congress to grant Russia permanent ""normal trade relations"" (PNTR) status. The change in Russia's trade status will require legislation to lift the restrictions currently applied to Russia under Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 which includes the ""freedom-of-emigration"" requirements of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. On November 19 2006 U.S. and Russian officials signed the bilateral agreement on Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Two basic methods are used by the Senate to bring legislation to the floor for consideration. The Senate at the majority leader's request grants unanimous consent to take up a matter or agrees to his motion to proceed to consider it. Because the motion to proceed is subject to debate in most circumstances it is not frequently used. Both methods are derived from the basic premise that the Senate as a body may decide what matters it considers. The Senate may also use the same two methods to bring up executive business (nominations and treaties).,Private

The Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative (BMENA) is a multilateral development and reform plan aimed at fostering economic and political liberalization in a wide geographic area of Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries. In December 2004 the first BMENA meeting took place in Rabat Morocco and was called the Forum for the Future. At the forum foreign ministers and finance ministers of the countries in the region stretching from Morocco to Pakistan as well as from the countries of the G8 pledged to create several new development programs and committed $60 million to a regional fund for business development. Critics of BMENA contend that the initiative focuses too heavily on economic issues instead of political reform and does little to strengthen non-governmental organizations and civil society groups in Arab and non- Arab Muslim countries.

Argentina's restructuring of over $100 billion in defaulted bond debt in June 2005 demonstrated the country's emergence from its 2001-2002 economic crisis that had caused severe stress on the political system. Current President Néstor Kirchner elected in 2003 has made bold policy moves in the areas of human rights institutional reform and economic policy that have helped restore Argentines' faith in democracy. The October 2005 legislative elections demonstrated strong support for President Kirchner whose popularity at this juncture bodes well for his re-election if he chooses to run in the October 2007 presidential election. Economic growth has rebounded since 2003 and in January 2006 Argentina paid off its $9.5 billion debt to the International Monetary Fund.

Throughout the last few decades the United States has had a strong interest in El Salvador. During the 1980s El Salvador was the largest recipient of U.S. aid in Latin America as its government struggled against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) insurgency during a 12-year civil war. A 1992 negotiated peace accord brought the war to an end and formally assimilated the FMLN into the political process as a political party. After the peace accords were signed U.S. involvement shifted towards helping the government rebuild democracy and implement market-friendly economic reforms. Successive National Republican Alliance (ARENA) governments including that of the current president Tony Saca have maintained close ties with the United States. The political scene in El Salvador has become increasingly focused on the January 2009 legislative elections and the March 2009 presidential election. U.S. observers are most interested in the upcoming presidential election particularly since the FMLN candidate Mauricio Funes appears to be leading the ARENA candidate Rodrigo �vila in the polls.,Private

South Korea followed a conciliation policy toward North Korea under the administrations of Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun; but President Lee Myung-bak elected in December 2007 states that he will link South Korean aid to North Korea more closely to the nuclear issue and will press North Korea on human rights.

"Islamic finance is based on principles of shariah or ""Islamic law."" Major principles of shariah are a ban on interest a ban on uncertainty adherence to risksharing and profit-sharing promotion of ethical investments that enhance society and asset-backing. The international market for Islamic finance has grown between 10% to 15% annually in recent years. Islamic finance historically has been concentrated in the Persian Gulf countries but has expanded globally to both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. There is a small but growing market for Islamic finance in the United States. Through international and domestic regulatory bodies there has been effort to standardize regulations in Islamic finance across different countries and financial institutions although challenges remain. Critics of Islamic finance express concerns about possible ties between Islamic finance and political agendas or terrorist financing and the use of Islamic finance to circumvent U.S. economic sanctions. Proponents argue that Islamic finance presents significant new business opportunities and provides alternate methods for capital formation and economic development.",Private
"S. 364 (Rockefeller) would amend the URAA to require that Congress expressly approve any regulatory modification or final rule proposed to implement an adverse WTO ruling and would rescind certain regulatory actions that have already entered into effect.

"In effect the Senate acts in a unicameral capacity when it is engaged in ""executive business""--so-called because the Senate and the chief executive are constitutionally involved in considering treaties and nominations.

Products liability refers to the liability of a manufacturer or seller for injury caused by his product to the person or property of a buyer or third party. Legal developments starting in the 1960s particularly the adoption of strict tort liability have made it substantially easier for persons injured by defective products to recover damages. Starting in the 1980s however many states enacted tort reform legislation that limited the rights of injured parties. Advocates for consumers and plaintiffs view strong products liability law as necessary to ensure adequate compensation for injured workers and consumers and to furnish an incentive for the manufacture of safe products. Manufacturers and their insurers by contrast contend that many products liability judgments are unwarranted or excessive and that national uniformity in products liability law is needed. Therefore they favor replacing the 50 state products liability laws with one federal law. In the 110th Congress the following bills have been introduced that would affect various aspects of products liability law: H.R. 961 H.R. 989 H.R. 1012 H.R. 2067 S. 243 S. 244 and S. 328.,Private

"A ""grand coalition"" government of Germany's two largest parties the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Socialist Union1 (CDU/CSU) and the Social Democrats (SPD) led by CDU candidate Angela Merkel took office on November 22 2005 after the two parties worked out an agreement on a coalition governing program. The German federal election of September 18 2005 had produced no clear winner or direction for the next government. Some see this government as short-lived and unlikely to succeed while others believe that only such a coalition has the combined strength to implement potentially painful but needed economic and social benefits reforms assuming that it can overcome partisan politics. Foreign policy is likely to play a secondary and less contentious role given the press of domestic business and a general consensus on most international issues. The atmosphere of U.S.- German relations has already improved since the Merkel government took office as reflected by the successful first official visit of Chancellor Merkel to Washington on January 13 2006.",Private

A consistent theme of U.S. and other international criticism of Russia is that Russian troops use excessive and indiscriminate force to quell separatism in Chechnya and commit serious human rights abuses. Several analysts have discerned a decrease in Bush Administration criticism of Russian policy in Chechnya perhaps spurred to some degree by the Moscow theater hostage crisis and stepped-up terrorist bombings and armed attacks throughout Russia in 2003-2004. U.S. concerns before the Iraq conflict with gaining Russias support also may have contributed to the shifts. There appeared to be fewer Administration suggestions to Russia that it should open peace talks with former Chechnya leader Aslan Maskhadov more tolerance for Russias argument that it was battling terrorism in Chechnya and some hope that elections and rebuilding in Chechnya could contribute to a political settlement. But some in the Administration also argue that Russia is showing declining interest in the adoption of Western democratic and human rights values and that such slippage could ultimately harm bilateral relations.

U.S. relations with India depend largely on Indias political leadership. Indias 2004 national elections ended governance by the center-right coalition headed by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and brought in a new center-left coalition led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

The prospect of a GMD capability based in Europe raises a number of significant international security and foreign policy questions.

On May 6 2007 French voters chose the Gaullist Nicolas Sarkozy to be President of France. In a contentious campaign he defeated the Socialist S�gol�ne Royal by a margin of 53.1% to 46.9%. Sarkozy will assume power on May 16. The two-round legislative elections will follow on June 10 and 17. Sarkozy represents a younger generation of leaders at a time when a majority of the French public believes their country is in decline in part due to enduring low economic growth and high unemployment in part to an apparent diminishing influence in guiding the course of the European Union (EU). The second round of the presidential elections saw a near-record turnout of 84.9% in a campaign that was closely watched by voters. Sarkozy succeeded in capturing a majority of both the women's vote and the vote of those over 60.

Because of their importance to the U.S. economy and to many U.S. trade partners textile and apparel trade has been a major issue in trade relations with a number of countries and regions. Other industrialized countries have faced similar issues and international and domestic measures were undertaken to try to resolve conflicts between the interests of exporters and importers.

Over the past year increasing attention has focused on China's growing interest in Latin America. Most analysts appear to agree that China's primary interest in the region is to gain greater access to needed resources - such as oil copper and iron - through increased trade and investment. Some also believe Beijing's additional goal is to isolate Taiwan by luring the 12 Latin American and Caribbean nations still maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan to shift their diplomatic recognition to China. Some analysts maintain that China's involvement in the region could pose a future threat to U.S. influence. Others assert that China's inroads in Latin America are marginal and likely to remain overwhelmed by the economic and geographic advantage of the U.S. market. Although many Latin American countries welcome the new Chinese investment some view China as an economic threat and are concerned that both their domestic industries and their U.S. export markets will be overwhelmed by cheap Chinese imports.,Private

The bill also requires the President to report within 90 days and every year thereafter on the sale by Belarus of weapons or weapons-related assistance to regimes supporting terrorism and on the personal wealth of Lukashenko and other senior Belarusian leaders. The 109th Congress passed several resolutions criticizing human rights abuses and calling on Belarus to hold free and fair elections. In January 2007 President Bush signed the Belarus Democracy Reauthorization Act (P.L. 109-480) which reauthorized and updated the provisions of the 2004 law.,Private
SOFAs are often included along with other types of military agreements as part of a comprehensive security arrangement with a particular country. A SOFA itself does not constitute a security arrangement; rather it establishes the rights and privileges of U.S. personnel present in a country in support of the larger security arrangement. SOFAs may be entered based on authority found in previous treaties and congressional actions or as sole executive agreements. The United States is currently party to more than 100 agreements that may be considered SOFAs. A list of current agreements included at the end of this report is categorized in tables according to the underlying source of authority if any for each of the SOFAs.,Private
The pending debate over reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is likely to be a high priority in the 110th Congress. Funding authorizations for aviation programs set forth in Vision 100 - the Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (P.L. 108-176 hereafter referred to as Vision 100) as well as authorization of the existing aviation tax structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund are set to expire at the end of FY2007.

The CAFTA-DR is not expected to have a large effect on the U.S. economy as a whole given the relatively small size of the Central American economies and the fact that most U.S. imports from the region had already been entering duty free under normal trade relations or CBI and GSP preferential arrangements. Adjustments will be slightly more difficult for some sectors but none are expected to be severe. Supporters see it as part of a policy foundation supportive of both improved intraregional trade as well as long-term social political and economic development in an area of strategic importance to the United States. Opponents wanted better trade adjustment and capacity building policies to address the potentially negative effects on certain importcompeting sectors and their workers. They also argued that the labor intellectual property rights and investment provisions in the CAFTA-DR needed strengthening. discusses negotiation issues and evolution of the CAFTA-DR agreement from the time negotiations commenced on January 27 2003 until its implementation by the last country on January 1 2009.,Private

The government of this long-term U.S. ally is trying to address endemic economic and social problems while adhering to stringent International Monetary Fund guidelines. Active Islamist groups capitalize on societal ills and create a troubling context for the government's efforts. They and others are victims of human rights abuses.

Members of Congress have become increasingly concerned about a perceived decline in U.S. manufacturing particularly as it may affect employment levels in their states or districts. For two years after the economy emerged from a relatively shallow recession in 2001 there was a continuing loss in manufacturing jobs. And even as the recovery progresses many fear that new non-manufacturing jobs will not have the same relatively high levels of wages and benefits traditionally associated with manufacturing. By contrast despite the recession of 2001 the level of real (inflation-adjusted) U.S. manufacturing output as of mid-2005 stood almost 30% higher than at a similar point after the recession of 1991 with about 2.5 million fewer manufacturing employees. This is more than three times real manufacturing output in 1960 when a comparable number of people were employed in manufacturing.,Private

The seven-year term of Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer was scheduled to expire on May 16 2007 and parliament (the Grand National Assembly) was required to elect a successor by that date. Since November 2002 the Justice and Development Party (AKP) a party with Islamist roots which claims a conservative democratic orientation controlled a comfortable majority in parliament but its numbers fell short of the two-thirds needed to elect a president in the first and second rounds of a vote. Sezer a former head of the Constitutional Court is an ardent secularist who often vetoed AKP-proposed laws and appointments that he found conflicted with the founding nationalist and secularist principles of the state. Both the AKP and its secularist opponents understood that much was at stake in the choice of Sezer's replacement. On April 25 2007 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan named Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul to be the AKP's candidate for president. In doing so Erdogan appears to have severely misjudged his opposition failed to provide sufficient time for thoughtful discussion and contributed to one of the worst political crises in recent Turkish history.,Private

"On September 1 2008 Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda stunned observers by resigning his post saying that a new leader might be able to avoid the ""political vacuum"" that he faced in office. Fukuda's 11-month tenure was marked by low approval ratings a sputtering economy and virtual paralysis in policymaking as the opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) used its control of the Upper House of Japan's parliament (the Diet) to delay or halt most government proposals. On September 22 the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will elect a new president who will become Japan's third prime minister in as many years. Ex-Foreign Minister Taro Aso a popular figure known for his conservative foreign policy credentials and support for increased deficit spending is widely expected to win. Many analysts expect that the new premier will dissolve the Lower House and call for parliamentary elections later in the fall. As a result Japanese policymaking is likely to enter a period of disarray which could negatively affect several items of interest to the United States including the passage of budgets to support the realignment of U.S. forces in Japan and the renewal of legislation that authorizes the deployment of Japanese navy vessels that are refueling ships supporting U.S.-led operations in Afghanistan. analyzes the factors behind and implications of Japan's current political turmoil.",Private
Vietnam's addition to the U.S. GSP program is generally viewed as another step in the process of promoting the continued growth of trade relations and expanding bilateral ties between the two countries.

Since 1991 the these three countries have made great strides in building democracies and free market economies.

Japan's FTA program assuming the current cautious and defensive course persists is likely to have varied effects on U.S. interests. On the one hand it is likely to provide a positive yet small boost to increasing Japan's role in the economics and political economy of East Asia. It is also likely to be favorable to bilateral trade ties as other Asian trading partners (instead of just the United States) pressure Japan to open its agricultural market further. On the other hand the absence of a meaningful agricultural reform bodes poorly for support from Japan in the agricultural negotiations of the Doha Round. There are also concerns that a defensive and weak FTA program could allow China to play a more dominant role in the Asian economy through its own FTA program - perhaps even creating a exclusionary Asian trading bloc.,Private

In 1979 official U.S. relations with Taiwan (the Republic of China) became a casualty of the American decision to recognize the communist government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) as China's sole legitimate government. Since then U.S. unofficial relations with Taiwan have been built on the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act (P.L. 96-8) and shaped by three U.S.-China communiques.

"To effectively analyze the desired size and characteristics of tomorrow's military some argue that we must take a hard look at feasible real-world contingencies. A possible conflict with China attracts considerable attention from defense planners because it is a regional competitor today and could over time grow to be a ""near-peer"" competitor. Analysts can also easily identify flashpoints where the two nations might meet and feel compelled to defend national interests. The analysis in this report seeks to explore the possible role that U.S. nuclear and conventional forces might play in four stages of potential conflicts: deterrence prior to the start of the conflict; crisis stability in the early stages of the conflict; warfighting during the height of the conflict; and war termination through either a negotiated settlement or a battlefield victory. highlights a number of policy issues that may bear consideration in the ongoing debate regarding military investments.",Private

Since FY2001 Congress has conditioned U.S. aid to Serbia on a presidential certification that Serbia has met certain conditions including cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The second session of the 110th Congress may consider similar certification provisions in the FY2009 foreign aid legislation. Supporters of aid conditionality say such provisions may have spurred Serbia's cooperation with the Tribunal. Serbian cooperation with the ICTY may also be affected by the status of Serbia's Kosovo province. The Serbian government and parliament have threatened to sharply downgrade relations with any country that recognizes Kosovo's independence. If the United States and most European Union countries recognize Kosovo as they are expected to do in early 2008 Serbia cooperation with the ICTY might cease at least for a time.,Private

"A 1996 amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) enables American victims of international terrorist acts supported by certain States designated by the State Department as sponsors of terrorism - Cuba Iran North Korea Sudan Syria and previously Iraq and Libya - to bring suit in U.S. courts for damages. Despite congressional efforts to make blocked (or ""frozen"") assets of such States available for attachment by judgment creditors in such cases plaintiffs encountered difficulties in enforcing the awards. Congress passed as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2008 (NDAA) (H.R. 1585) an amendment to the FSIA to provide a federal cause of action against terrorist States and to facilitate enforcement of judgments. After the President vetoed the NDAA based on the possible impact the measure would have on Iraqi assets Congress passed a new version P.L. 110-181 (H.R. 4986) which includes authority for the President to waive the FSIA provision with respect to Iraq.

"Over the past several years reports indicate that an increasing number of U.S. firms have altered their structure by substituting a foreign parent corporation for a domestic one. Such ""inversions"" typically involve creation of a new foreign corporation in a country with low tax rates (a ""tax haven"") that becomes the parent of the firm's foreign and U.S. component corporations. A chief motive for inversions is apparently savings by firms on their U.S. corporate income tax. One source of savings is tax on a firm's foreign income: the United States taxes corporations chartered in the United States on both U.S. and foreign income but taxes foreignchartered corporations only on their U.S.-source income. An inversion can thus potentially reduce a firm's U.S. taxes on foreign income. Other tax savings apparently result from ""earnings stripping"" or the shifting of U.S.-source income from taxable U.S. components of the firm to the tax-exempt foreign parts.",Private

In recent years Congress has been increasingly concerned that other countries - China Japan Taiwan and Korea in particular - are manipulating the value of their national currencies in ways injurious to the U.S. economy. A spate of legislation was introduced in the 109th Congress seeking to pressure foreign countries to revalue their currencies or seeking changes in the international financial system - particularly changes in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - that would help accomplish that end. Similar bills are likely to be introduced in the 110th Congress.,Private
"In the week before Congress adjourned for recess on September 30 the House and Senate passed conference agreements on both the FY2007 national defense authorization bill H.R. 5122 and the FY2007 defense appropriations bill H.R. 5631. The President signed the appropriations bill into law P.L. 109-289 on September 29 and he signed the authorization bill into law P.L. 109-364 on October 17. The conference agreement on the appropriations bill provides $436.6 billion for defense including $366.6 billion in regular appropriations and $70 billion in additional appropriations mainly as a ""bridge fund"" for operations abroad. The total of regular appropriations is $4 billion below the Administration request. The Senatepassed bill provided $9 billion less than the request which freed that much to add to non-defense appropriations bills. The White House  however threatened to veto the defense bill if reduced defense by more than $4 billion.",Private
This is a comparison of the laws of the United Kingdom and of the United States that govern criminal and intelligence investigations of terrorist activities. Both systems rely upon a series of statutory authorizations: in the case of the United States primarily the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act; in the case of the United Kingdom the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act the Police Act the Intelligence Services Act. Among other differences the U.S. procedures rely more heavily upon judicial involvement and supervision while those of the UK employ other safeguards. The UK procedures afford greater latitude to arrest detain and supervise suspected terrorists than those available in the United States.,Private
The overview that this report provides is useful background information for a number of policy issues that have received congressional consideration. Analysis of these policy issues is beyond the scope of this report. Some of these issues are the political status of the territories and their relationship with the United States; whether the possessions are taxed unfairly or more favorably than the states taking into account their limited participation in federal spending programs; and whether the possessions that use the mirror system of taxation have sufficient fiscal flexibility given the difference between their economies and that of the United States.,Private

The policy issues for Congress surrounding the monitoring and enforcement of international trade agreements focus on three basic problems. The first is whether sufficient resources and the governmental organization exist to accomplish the task. The second and related issue is whether new data and information should be generated to determine whether trade agreements are being fully implemented. A third issue is the effectiveness of various monitoring and enforcement approaches and whether the WTO dispute settlement mechanism is effectively resolving complaints.,Private
The House has chosen to handle committee jurisdiction in a number of ways. It has chosen to concentrate jurisdiction over an issue in new existing and temporary committees. It has chosen to keep jurisdiction over components of an issue distributed among several committees. And it has chosen to vest in one committee jurisdiction over a narrow subject matter that could just as readily have been considered a component of subject matter within another committees jurisdiction. Rules relating to referral and the Speakers referral authority have also been changed to deal with jurisdictional issues.

The role for Congress in this financial crisis is multifaceted. A major issue is how to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of financial markets to promote the general well-being of the country while protecting taxpayer interests and facilitating business operations without creating a moral hazard. In addition to preventing future crises through legislative oversight and domestic regulatory functions Congress has been providing funds and ground rules for economic stabilization packages and informing the public through hearings and other means. The largest question may be how U.S. regulations should be changed if necessary and how closely any changes are harmonized with international recommendations. Other questions include: should the United States promote global regulatory standards to be voluntarily adopted by countries or should a supranational regulatory institution be created that would impose rules on international financial markets? Where would enforcement authority reside; at the state national or international level? Congress also plays a role in measures to reform international financial institutions and in recapitalizing the International Monetary Fund. Also should U.S. policies be designed to restore confidence in and induce return to the normal functioning of a self-correcting financial system or has the system itself become inherently unstable?,Private

On December 7 1998 the federal banking regulators invited comments on proposed regulations that would require banks and thrifts to develop formal policies and procedures whereby they could identify unusual transactions in customers' accounts to report as suspicious activity in conjunction with the federal laws outlawing money laundering. Small banks criticized the increased costs of screening. Individuals and businesses raised privacy concerns. Although there were varied proposals before the 106th Congress on the issue no legislation was enacted. The issue likeliest to command attention in the 107th Congress is international money laundering. There have been recent instances in which banking regulators imposed corrective action comparable to the Know Your Customer requirements on the several international banking institutions after unearthing potential money laundering activity.,Private

National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) are often of considerable interest to many Members of Congress. They represent the most formal assessment of a given issue by the U.S. Intelligence Community and address issues of major national security importance which may require congressional action. The intelligence process however is not an exact science and on occasion NIEs have proved unreliable because they were based on insufficient evidence or contained faulty analysis. This was demonstrated in the NIE produced in 2002 on Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction parts of which were significantly inaccurate. NIEs can provide insights into the likely effects of certain policy approaches but they are not usually made to take into account the details of planned U.S. diplomatic economic military or legislative initiatives.,Private
"China's rapid economic growth since 1979 has transformed it into a major economic power. Over the past few years many analysts have contended that China could soon overtake the United States to become the world's largest economy based on estimates of China's economy on a ""purchasing power parity"" (PPP) basis which attempts to factor in price differences across countries when estimating the size of a foreign economy in U.S. dollars. However in December 2007 the World Bank issued a study that lowered its previous 2005 PPP estimate of the size of China's economy by 40%. If these new estimates are accurate it will likely be many years before China's economy reaches U.S. levels. The new PPP data could also have an impact on U.S. and international perceptions over other aspects of China's economy including its living standards poverty levels and government expenditures such as on the military.",Private

Putin's genuine popularity at home combined with the near-total control that he and his regime exercise over nearly every aspect of the political scene guaranteed the electoral outcomes sought by the Kremlin. Major questions remain however about the configuration of political power after Medvedev succeeds Putin as president. What will be the balance of power between the President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin? Will a diarchy of power be stable? Will Putin seek to regain the presidency after a Medvedev interregnum which would legalize a third (and fourth) non-consecutive term for Putin? The answers to these questions will help determine the course of Russia's political evolution  continuing and consolidating the authoritarianism that Putin has fostered or moderating that trend. At the same time Russia's domestic political evolution will likely have a strong influence on its relations with its neighbors with the EU and NATO and with the United States.,Private

The Gaza crisis constitutes a conundrum for all involved. Israel would like to avoid a drawn-out invasion and occupation of Gaza but at the same time does not want to abandon the military operation without assurance that the end result will leave Israelis more secure from rocket attacks. Although the ground attack might endanger its rule in Gaza Hamas may welcome it in the hopes of miring Israeli forces in close-quarters combat to strip away their advantages in technology and firepower and in hopes of heightening perceptions that Palestinians are being victimized. Linking the cessation of violence in and around Gaza with international enforcement of a truce or a broader regional security initiative may be possible but at present no proposed solution appears straightforward.,Private

"The Bush Administration has made bilateral and regional free-trade agreements (FTAs) an important element of U.S. trade policy a strategy known as ""competitive liberalization."" This strategy it argues will push forward trade liberalization simultaneously on bilateral regional and multilateral fronts. It is meant to spur trade negotiations by liberalizing trade with countries willing to join FTAs and to pressure other countries to negotiate multilaterally. Critics contend however that the accent on regional and bilateral negotiations undermines the multilateral forum and increases the risk of trade diversion away from competitive countries not in the trade bloc.

"The first East Asia Summit (EAS) met on December 14 2005 in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. It brought together the ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) [Brunei Burma Cambodia Indonesia Laos Malaysia Philippines Singapore Thailand and Vietnam] as well as the ""plus three"" states [China South Korea and Japan] and Australia New Zealand and India to discuss issues of common concern. Japanese officials have described the EAS as an ""historic summit meeting to be held with a view to establishing a future East Asia Community."" Such a group could potentially replace Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) as the main multilateral forum in Asia on trade and investment liberalization and economic integration. Russia was invited to attend the EAS as a special guest. Some in the United States are concerned that the East Asia Summit marks a rise in Asian regionalism in which the United States is not playing a leading role. There is also concern that China may use the East Asia Summit to consolidate a leading role in Asia. A key outcome of the first East Asia Summit is that ASEAN appears to have retained a central role in the process.",Private

This reports explains the origin growth and persistence of committee controls over executive agency decisions in the face of repeated legal and constitutional objections by various Administrations. By reviewing the origin of committee controls six to seven decades ago one is better able to understand how and why these committee-agency relationships were forged and why some committee-veto provisions have survived after the Supreme Court in INS v. Chadha (1983) declared the legislative veto unconstitutional. What is interesting about the continuation of committee review procedures after Chadha is that they appear not merely in statutory provisions (objected to regularly by Presidents in their signing statements) but in agency budget manuals as well. That is despite constitutional objections raised by Presidents and the Justice Department executive departments and agencies have found it both practicable and necessary to submit certain proposals to designated committees for their review and approval.,Private

The Kurdish-inhabited region of northern Iraq has been relatively peaceful and prosperous since the fall of Saddam Hussein. However the Iraqi Kurds' political autonomy demands and ambitions are causing friction with Christian and other minorities in the north with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other Arab leaders of Iraq and with neighboring Turkey and Iran. These tensions threaten to undermine the stability achieved throughout Iraq in 2008 although U.S. political influence over the Kurds is likely to prevent a near term de-stabilizing escalation of the disputes. The U.S. ability to keep these tensions contained could wane as U.S. forces as planned draw down from Iraq over the next three years.,Private
Japan has expressed interest in purchasing the F-22A Raptor aircraft from the United States.

Other Than Mexicans (OTMs) apprehended along the Southwest border by the USBP between official POE cannot be returned to Mexico because Mexico will not accept them. Instead they must be returned to their countries of origin or third countries that will accept them by the Office of Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). However DRO does not have enough detention beds to accommodate every OTM that is apprehended. As a result of this the majority of OTMs apprehended by the USBP in FY2005 were released into the interior of the United States with notices to appear before an immigration judge. Most of these released OTMs fail to show up for their hearings and are not ultimately removed. In order to address the increasing number of OTMs being apprehended and circumvent the regular removal process the USBP is currently expanding its Expedited Removal (ER) program across the entire southwest border. Issues for Congress include the potential for terrorist infiltration the current lack of detention bed-space that has led to OTMs being released into the interior of the country whether the expansion of the ER program will succeed with the current levels of detention bedspace and how best to deploy DHS resources to address the growing number of OTMs entering into the country illegally.,Private

Legislation passed late in the 103rd Congress granted the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) authority to design and implement more rigorous rules regulating the au pair program. In 1997 the au pair program received considerable media attention as a result of the Louise Woodward court case regarding possible involvement of an au pair in the death of a child in Massachusetts. The U.S. Information Agency amended existing federal regulations for the au pair program in September 1997 to underscore the cultural exchange aspect of the program and strengthen au pair recruiting and training.,Private
The new Palestinian unity government established in March 2007 complicates U.S. policy toward the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the peace process. When Hamas took power last year the Bush Administration along with its Quartet partners and Israel responded by cutting off contact with and halting assistance to the PA. The Administration sought to isolate and remove Hamas while supporting moderates in Fatah led by President Mahmud Abbas. The international sanctions have not driven Hamas from power and instead some assert they may have provided an opening for Iran to increase its influence among Palestinians by filling the void. Now that Hamas and Fatah are sharing power it will be harder to isolate Hamas. The United States and European countries have held meetings with non-Hamas members of the new government while Israel continues to rule out all contact with PA ministers. Arab states led by Saudi Arabia are pressing for recognition of the new government and an end to the international boycott. Some observers believe Saudi efforts to gain acceptance of the unity government and restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks may be an effort to set the price for Saudi cooperation on other U.S. policies in the region. In 2006 Congress passed P.L. 109-446 the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 to tighten existing restrictions on aid to the Palestinians. In 2007 Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced H.R. 1856 which would amend the original Act to further restrict contact with and assistance to the PA.,Private
China is a major source of U.S. imports of consumer products (such as toys) and an increasingly important supplier of various food products.

There is a large and growing difference between the official trade statistics released by the United States and the People's Republic of China. According to the United States the 2007 bilateral trade deficit with China was $256.3 billion. According to China its trade surplus with the United States was $162.9 billion - $93.4 billion less. This paper examines the differences in the trade data from the two nations in two ways. First it compares the trade figures at the two digit level using the Harmonized System to discern any patterns in the discrepancies between the U.S. and Chinese data. This comparison reveals that over two-thirds of the difference in the value of China's exports to the United States is attributable to five types of goods. The second approach to examining the differing trade data involves a review of the existing literature on the technical and non-technical sources of the trade data discrepancies.,Private
There is concern that President Alberto Fujimori not only manipulated the system to allow himself to run for a third term but also inhibited freedom of speech and of the press. Critics charge that he controlled judicial and electoral institutions in such a way as to impede the development of a free and fair electoral process and limited the rights of all citizens to participate in the electoral process either as candidates or voters. Options for Congress range from a cautious approach aimed at protecting security interests to applying greater pressure on the government of Peru to respect and develop democratic processes.,Private
In a low voter turnout in legislative elections on December 11 2004 the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT) increased its legislative majority against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). This means that DPP President Chen Shui-bian who was reelected to a second term on March 20 2004 again will not be able to count on legislative support for his policies in his second and final term. In both the presidential and legislative election campaigns Chen emphasized gaining a separate international identity for Taiwan an emphasis to which Beijing strenuously objected as dangerously close to declaring Taiwan independence from China. While Chens strategy appeared to gain the DPP electoral momentum in March it may have had the opposite electoral effect in December. In response to his partys defeat at the polls Chen resigned as DPP party chair on December 15 2004. He is expected to have to moderate his policies and move closer to the political center for the rest of his term in order to regain public support and in an effort to ensure legislative support for his economic and other policy initiatives. Any move to dial down pro-independence rhetoric could ease tensions with Beijing and the concerns of U.S. policymakers.,Private

"Exercising one or another of these ""rights to die"" may have drastically different legal consequences: some currently have no legal consequence some are a violation of common-law some are a violation of statute some may have contractual consequences some may result in an action such as civil confinement some are currently protected by legislation and some may be protected by the United States Constitution. examines the legal status of the five distinct issues: 1) suicide 2) passive euthanasia 3) assisted suicide 4) active euthanasia and 5) palliative care. The report examines the history of how each of these issues has been treated and evaluates the constitutional right of a person to pursue these courses of action. It addresses state law regarding living wills advance medical directives and how these types of decisions are made regarding persons who have left neither. The report addresses congressional powers and existing federal statutes that are implicated in these issues such as the Patient Self-Determination Act the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act and the Controlled Substances Act. It then addresses bills introduced in the 109th Congress S. 539 and H.R. 1151 both entitled the ""Incapacitated Persons Legal Protection Act of 2005;"" a bill passed by the House H.R. 1332 ""The Protection of Incapacitated Persons Act of 2005;"" a bill passed by the Senate ""For the Relief of the Parents of Theresa Marie Schiavo;"" and a similar bill passed by the House and Senate S. 686. This last bill was signed by the President and became P.L. 109-3. The report notes that current state regulations prohibiting assisted suicide have been upheld by the Supreme Court and that similar prohibitions against active euthanasia are likely to be upheld against constitutional challenge. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment however appears to limit a state's ability to regulate passive euthanasia (termination of medical treatment). Finally palliative care may ultimately be found to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment but the possible abuse of such care may raise policy concerns.",Private

In the 109th Congress several bills have been introduced concerning breastfeeding. At this time all of the bills are in committee. H.R. 2122 the proposed Pregnancy Discrimination Act Amendments of 2005 was introduced on May 5 2005.

The United States welcomed the successful October conclusion of 2002 elections in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir where nearly half of the electorate cast ballots. The elections resulted in the ousting of the long-dominant National Conference party allies of the national coalition-leading Bharatiya Janata Party thus bolstering the credibility of the process and dampening criticism from some quarters that the elections were flawed or farcical. The opposition Indian National Congress and the regional People's Democratic Party won a combined 36 seats in the state assembly and Congress leader Sonia Gandhi agreed to a first-ever power-sharing coalition.,Private
Former President Alan Garcia continued his political comeback by being elected President on June 4 2006 defeating populist Ollanta Humala. Not only the winning candidate will have an impact on U.S. relations with Peru: lacking a majority in the newly-elected Congress Garcia will have to negotiate with the other parties to pass his program.

It examines the reach of the executive order and provides legal analyses of some of the constitutional questions raised in the courts by similar sanctions programs noting that the broad language of the executive order is not unprecedented. In view of the fact that there is an expectation that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) will publish names of persons designated under the executive order and issue regulations further refining its terms and applicability the report examines some of the procedures available to challenge OFAC sanction regulations and briefly discusses OFAC's rules which may be of concern to attorneys representing individuals and entities subjected to sanctions or involved in transactions with sanctioned persons.,Private
Federal court denial of British extradition requests in the cases of four fugitives from Northern Ireland led to the Supplementary Extradition Treaty. The Treaty proved controversial and before the Senate would give its consent it insisted upon modifications some quite unusual. Those modifications have been eliminated in a newly negotiated treaty to which the Senate has recently given its advice and consent and which incorporates features often more characteristic of contemporary extradition treaties with other countries. The Senate conditioned its approval of the Treaty upon an understanding two declarations and three provisos which relate to the Treaty's treatment of the exception for politically motivated requests and the role of the courts its changes in the double jeopardy clause assurances that the Treaty is not designed to accomplish the extradition of fugitives from Northern Ireland covered by the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement and reporting requirements concerning the disposition of requests under the Treaty.,Private
"Prior to 2004 the Extraterritorial Income (ETI) provisions of the U.S. tax code provided a tax benefit for exporters. ETI like the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) provisions they replaced was designed to boost U.S. exports. The European Union (EU) however filed complaints with the World Trade Organization (WTO) charging that ETI and FSC were export subsidies and so violated the WTO agreements. In a succession of rulings the WTO upheld the EU's charges and authorized the EU to levy retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. The EU began a phased-in application of tariffs in March 2004. Several policy options for the United States were proposed in Congress including retaining ETI and accepting whatever tariffs would be imposed; overhauling the U.S. method of taxing foreign-source income by adopting a ""territorial"" tax system; reforming the U.S. tax system in general by adopting a consumption tax similar to the value-added taxes levied by European countries; attempting negotiations with the EU; and repealing the ETI provisions while replacing them with tax cuts elsewhere. The last of these approaches was ultimately taken by Congress in October 2004 with the enactment of the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA; P.L. 108-357). Although the EU lifted its tariffs in January 2005 it also lodged a WTO complaint against transition provisions in AJCA which had the effect of rescinding the ETI only gradually in certain cases. In May 2006 a provision of the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act (P.L. 109-222) repealed the transition rules apparently bringing an end to the longsimmering controversy.",Private

Member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) contribute to the activities of the alliance in several ways the chief of which is through the deployment of their own armed forces funded by their national budgets. Certain commonly conducted activities however are paid for out of three NATO-run budgets. These three accounts - the civil budget the military budget and the security investment program - are funded by individual contributions from the member states. The countries' percentage shares of the common funds are negotiated among the members and are based upon per capita GDP and several other factors. The aggregate U.S. share which has fallen over the past three decades was 25.8% in 2005. Ten central and eastern European nations were admitted into the alliance in 1999 and 2004 and several other countries would also like to join. As NATO expands it has incurred certain additional costs to accommodate the new members. These costs are being shared by all including the new countries. In 2005 members of the alliance adopted new burdensharing arrangements; the U.S. level however was limited to its current share. Additional changes in the cost share formulas are under review. The second session of the 110th Congress will likely review U.S. contributions to the NATO budgets in the context of the Defense and State Departments' appropriations.,Private

Russia announced on August 29 2008 that it was banning poultry imports from 19 U.S. establishments due to safety concerns and that 29 others could lose approval if they do not improve their standards. Russian officials also signaled that they might reduce U.S. permits to import poultry and pork under that country's quota system. The economic stakes of Russian import actions are high for U.S. poultry producers - 29% of their exports went to that market in 2007 - and red meat producers who also are experiencing strong growth in the Russian market. In Congress any potential options likely would be reviewed within the context of the broader geopolitical situation.,Private

Reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other aviation programs is likely to be a high priority in the 110th Congress as funding authorizations for aviation programs and the aviation tax structure that provides revenue for the aviation trust fund will expire at the end of FY2007.

One particularly controversial option under consideration is a more direct user fee system which is supported by the airlines but strongly opposed by many other system users. Congress may also examine airport financing mechanisms including airport improvement program (AIP) grants passenger facility charges (PFCs) bonds and other revenue sources.,Private

"As Congress weighs comprehensive immigration reform legislation that would likely include additional border and interior enforcement a significant expansion of guest workers and perhaps include increased levels of permanent immigration some question whether the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can handle the increased immigration workload. There are concerns that the immigration responsibilities in the DHS are not functioning effectively. DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff announced a ""Second Stage Review"" (2SR) in 2005 that includes strengthening border security and interior enforcement and reforming immigration processes as major agenda items.

"The Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution provides that the Congress shall have the power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce. The plain meaning of this language might indicate a limited power to regulate commercial trade between persons in one state and persons outside of that state. However the Commerce Clause has never been construed quite so narrowly. Rather the clause along with the economy of the United States has grown and become more complex. In addition when Congress began to address national social problems the Commerce Clause was often cited as the constitutional basis for such legislation. As a result the Commerce Clause has become the constitutional basis for a significant portion of the laws passed by the Congress over the last fifty years and it currently represents one of the broadest bases for the exercise of congressional powers. An examination of the United States Code shows that over 700 statutory provisions covering a range of issues explicitly refer to either ""interstate"" or ""foreign"" commerce. Over the last decade however the Supreme Court in United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison has brought into question the breadth of the Commerce Clause. While these cases have resulted in the overturning of a few federal laws their overall effect has so far been relatively modest in scope. A case currently before the Supreme Court however Ashcroft v. Raich could portend a more significant effect on current federal law.",Private

"Regional cooperation in halting continued overuse of scarce water resources has been a casualty of the long-running Arab-Israeli conflict. The Dead Sea has been a victim of this neglect and scientists estimate that it will decrease substantially in the coming decades due to overexploitation of the Jordan River. One possible solution is to construct a canal from the Red Sea to the Dead Sea to pump sea water into the salt lake while generating hydroelectric power for use in desalination. The governments of Israel and Jordan have been enthusiastic proponents of the ""Peace Canal"" and are calling on the international community including the United States to support its multi-billion dollar construction. However opponents of the canal claim that it may do more environmental harm than good and suggest that the Dead Sea be naturally restored by allowing the Jordan River to flow southward unimpeded.
