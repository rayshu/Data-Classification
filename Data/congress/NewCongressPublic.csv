  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President I come to the floor to correct the ,Public
record concerning statements the Senate majority leader made yesterday ,Public
in which he claimed that GEN John Abizaid's nomination to be Ambassador ,Public
  Allow me to ease the majority leader's concerns. Far from being ,Public
``held up'' the Foreign Relations Committee with my full support has ,Public
been extremely diligent in taking up General Abizaid's nomination; he ,Public
appeared on the very first committee nominations hearing of the 116th ,Public
Congress and his nomination is advancing through the regular committee ,Public
process expeditiously. I look forward to his approval by the committee ,Public
and hopefully a speedy confirmation. As with all nominees his final ,Public
confirmation is under the control of the majority leader.,Public
  I am concerned that the majority leader has an inaccurate view of the ,Public
nominations situation facing the Foreign Relations Committee. He stated ,Public
yesterday that ``if we want to solve problems in the Middle East ,Public
through diplomacy we'll need to confirm diplomats.'' Unfortunately we ,Public
  It took 23 months before the Trump administration bothered to ,Public
nominate General Abizaid leaving a gaping hole in our diplomatic ,Public
posture to Saudi Arabia and the region. It is possible that this ,Public
failure of leadership is the result of the President believing that his ,Public
son-in-law Jared Kushner is capable of doing this job from the White ,Public
  Regardless of the reason Saudi Arabia is not an isolated example. It ,Public
took even longer over 2 years before the Trump administration ,Public
nominated a candidate to be U.S. Ambassador to Turkey. We are now 26 ,Public
months into the Trump administration and we still lack ambassadorial ,Public
nominees to critical countries like Egypt Pakistan and our close ,Public
ally Jordan. This failure is a reckless abdication of a constitutional ,Public
responsibility that is essential to projecting American power abroad. ,Public
There is only one person responsible for this failure: President Trump; ,Public
yet the majority leader appears to be curiously oblivious to that fact.,Public
  Let me be clear: When the committee has received nominations we have ,Public
worked with efficiency and diligence to vet and advance those ,Public
nominations. I have devoted my time and staff resources to ensure this ,Public
because of my strong belief that the State Department USAID and other ,Public
foreign affairs agencies must be appropriately staffed. We cannot ,Public
promote our foreign policy protect American citizens and advocate for ,Public
American businesses without a robust diplomatic corps. In the 115th ,Public
Congress the committee reported 169 nominations. I reject any ,Public
assertion that we have not done our part to ensure that the State ,Public
  All too often however the committee has received nominations late ,Public
  There is unfortunately there is another severe problem that we ,Public
cannot ignore with regard to this administration's nominees. Delays in ,Public
advancing Trump political nominees is largely due to poor vetting by ,Public
this administration. When the President nominates and renominates ,Public
individuals with restraining orders for threats of violence who ,Public
engaged in incidents that should frankly mean they never should have ,Public
been nominated or made material omissions sometimes on a repeated ,Public
basis in their nomination materials the Foreign Relations Committee ,Public
must do our due diligence on behalf of the American people. Someone has ,Public
to. My staff and I have had to spend significant additional time on ,Public
vetting because of the White House's negligence or incompetence.,Public
  The United States and our allies continue to face tremendous ,Public
challenges around the world. We must continue to lead on the ,Public
international stage and work in collaboration with international ,Public
partners to achieve our shared security goals but to have our ,Public
diplomats in place they must be nominated in a timely fashion and ,Public
vetted properly. Despite the majority leader's confusion on this issue ,Public

From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov],Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from ,Public
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker we spent many hours in this Chamber talking ,Public
about the amendments to the appropriations bill this combination of ,Public
several appropriations bills that we will pass later this week.,Public
  What I would like to take a minute to talk about is an amendment I ,Public
didn't offer because we got the material in the base text.,Public
  Our Constitution creates a tension between Article I and Article II ,Public
when it comes to the power to wage war: the Commander in Chief on the ,Public
one hand versus the authority of Congress to declare war on the other.,Public
  Thomas Jefferson determined that it was necessary to get the approval ,Public
of Congress before he deployed Marines to the shores of Tripoli our ,Public
first non-declared war our first intervention in the Middle East and ,Public
a precedent that should have been followed by subsequent Presidents.,Public
  But in fact since the days of Jefferson on many occasions ,Public
Presidents just sent our troops in without seeking authority from ,Public
Congress. That is why in 1973 in the wake of the Vietnam war this ,Public
Congress passed the War Powers Act also known as the War Powers ,Public
Resolution. It provides that the President cannot deploy for more than ,Public
60 or 90 days without an authorization to use military force.,Public
  Now that act of 1973 is not everything it should be because it did ,Public
not encompass the idea of bombing without deploying troops for periods ,Public
of 60 or 90 days. It is unclear perhaps. It is in need of revision ,Public
perhaps but it is the only legal restraint on a President committing ,Public
us to war without any approval from this Congress.,Public
  But every Attorney General since the 1970s has advised Presidents ,Public
that the War Powers Act isn't actually binding on them that a ,Public
President can send unlimited troops into battle for an unlimited period ,Public
for any purpose. This is not what should be and yet many ,Public
constitutional scholars agree with these provisions with this ,Public
why the provision that we have in this appropriations bill is so ,Public
  I want to commend the subcommittee and the full committee for ,Public
including in the base text the provision that says no funds shall be ,Public
used in contravention of the War Powers Act. This is a provision I ,Public
originally proposed as an amendment on this floor in 2011. We lost the ,Public
first time but we ultimately prevailed and now it is part of the base ,Public
text. This adds the power of the purse to enforce the War Powers Act.,Public
  I am pleased to report that Attorney General Mukasey a Rean ,Public
Attorney General a strong advocate for Presidential power testified ,Public
before the Foreign Affairs Committee that he believes and would advise ,Public
the President that they need not follow the War Powers Act but that ,Public
they dare not spend a penny in contravention of the War Powers Act if ,Public
this provision is included in the relevant appropriations bill. So I ,Public
commend the committee for including this and assuring that any ,Public
reasonable Attorney General will tell any President they must adhere to ,Public
  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker in the remaining few seconds let me deal ,Public
with another subject. Mark Zuckerberg has announced that he's going to ,Public
  The effect would be to undermine our economy by reducing the ,Public
importance of the U.S. dollar in international transactions and to ,Public
undermine our national security by making it easier for drug dealers ,Public
terrorists and sanctions evaders to do businesses without using the ,Public
  I look forward to addressing this House further and to working in the ,Public
Financial Services Committee. But it certainly concerns me that a man ,Public
who has benefited like no other from the protection of the U.S. ,Public
national security efforts and from the U.S. economy would undermine ,Public
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov],Public
  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President on another matter today the Senate ,Public
will consider a War Powers Resolution offered by the junior Senator ,Public
from Virginia. Our colleague's resolution is deeply flawed on a number ,Public
  As I explained yesterday it is too blunt and too broad. It is also ,Public
an abuse of the War Powers Act which was designed to strike a balance ,Public
between the President's constitutional war powers and Congress's own ,Public
  Some of us believe the War Powers Act went too far in undermining the ,Public
separation of powers and infringing upon the authorities of the ,Public
Commander in Chief. But apart from that debate everyone should ,Public
acknowledge that it was designed to stop Vietnams--the deployment of ,Public
thousands of troops into sustained combat without congressional ,Public
uses of limited force that Presidents have carried out literally for ,Public
  Until recently most in this body recognized the need for Presidents ,Public
to have flexibility with respect to the threat of military force. They ,Public
saw the deterrent effect and diplomatic utility of keeping our options ,Public
  During President Obama's tenure Democrats said frequently that when ,Public
it comes to Iran we should never take the military option off the ,Public
table. But now they seek to use this privileged resolution to do ,Public
  The collateral institutional damage of this action would fall on our ,Public
military. Its ability to operate quickly and adaptively to emerging ,Public
  Colleagues if you want to take the truly significant step of ,Public
preemptively taking options off the table for defending our troops if ,Public
you really want to remove troops from Syria or Iraq altogether why ,Public
don't you just be honest about it and make your case? Find 60 votes to ,Public
pass legislation. Find 67 votes to override a Presidential veto. Don't ,Public
use a blunt and imprecise War Powers Resolution to end-run around the ,Public
constitutional structures that make this a difficult proposition by ,Public
  There is no ongoing protracted combat with respect to Iran. Our ,Public
troops are not mired in unending hostilities. The War Powers Act aims ,Public
to impose a 60-day clock on combat operations. The strike that killed ,Public
Soleimani took maybe 60 seconds. Let me say that again. The strike took ,Public
  We have just come through an impeachment trial because House ,Public
Democrats rushed to use this serious tool as a political weapon of ,Public
first resort rather than patiently conducting more normal oversight ,Public
using the more normal tools that Congresses of both parties typically ,Public
use. No patience for ordinary oversight--just rush to grab the bluntest ,Public
tool available to make a political statement against the President. ,Public
Well this war powers debate bears an eerie resemblance to that ,Public
  To listen to some of the advocates of Senator Kaine's resolution you ,Public
would think that sweeping resolutions like this were the only means ,Public
available to Senators to express any discomfort with White House ,Public
  If Senators' priority is genuine oversight there are countless tools ,Public
in their toolbox. They can hold hearings. They can engage the ,Public
administration directly. They can ask questions and raise issues they ,Public
feel were not sufficiently addressed in interagency deliberations.,Public
  Instead like impeachment this War Powers Resolution cuts short that ,Public
interplay between the branches. It short-circuits the thoughtful ,Public
deliberation and debate. It is a dangerously overbroad resolution that ,Public
should not pass Congress and is certain to be vetoed if it does. If my ,Public
colleagues want to make a real difference this is not the way to go.,Public
  The amendments my Rean colleagues and I have filed expose the ,Public
shortcomings and unintended risks of this approach.,Public
  Senator Kaine has drafted a rule of construction that tries to ,Public
provide an exception allowing U.S. troops to defend themselves against ,Public
an attack if it is ``imminent.'' My amendment exposes the absurdity of ,Public
  How imminent exactly is imminent enough? When do our men and women ,Public
in uniform get to defend themselves? I would like to know. Should our ,Public
servicemembers need to sit on intelligence until an attack is a week ,Public
away? A day away? An hour away? Until they see the whites of the ,Public
  And who makes the determination about imminence? Five hundred thirty-,Public
five Members of Congress? The President? A Pentagon lawyer? A ,Public
  This resolution imposes a new constraint on the military without ,Public
  If we have intelligence warning that an enemy is planning to attack ,Public
our forces can we not disrupt the plot until the attack is almost ,Public
  Senators Cotton Rounds and Sullivan have also filed amendments. ,Public
They propose sensible additions to give our troops and their commanders ,Public
more confidence we aren't trying to tie their hands against precisely ,Public
the threat they might face if Iran were again to become emboldened ,Public
enough to attack us--oh and to make sure we can defend our diplomats ,Public
and Embassies too if they were to face renewed threats.,Public
  So clearly this resolution is not ready for prime time. I believe it ,Public
is just an effort to broadcast a political message but even that ,Public
message can be harmful to our troops and to our national security.,Public
  So what message will the Senate send to American servicemembers? ,Public
Should they doubt whether their own leaders are authorized to defend ,Public
them? What message should we send to our regional allies and partners? ,Public
Can they count on continued solidarity from the United States? What ,Public
would it say to real great-power competitors like Russia and China if ,Public

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of ,Public
Jan-032019 the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) is ,Public
recognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the ,Public
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker throughout the debate yesterday on the ,Public
so-called War Powers Resolution fundamental misunderstandings surfaced ,Public
  The first misunderstanding is that the justification for the attack ,Public
that killed Soleimani was that he was an evil terrorist responsible for ,Public
the deaths of hundreds of Americans. Well there are a lot of evil ,Public
terrorists out there and that does not give the President authority to ,Public
  But what did give the President authority in this case was the fact ,Public
that Soleimani was acting as an armed combatant against U.S. forces in ,Public
a war zone in which the Congress had authorized the President to take ,Public
military action through the Authorization for the Use of Military Force ,Public
  Now I hate to shock my woke colleagues but killing active enemy ,Public
combatants is what war is all about and it is a war that Congress ,Public
  That act of Congress provides: ``The President is authorized to use ,Public
the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary ,Public
and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United ,Public
States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.'',Public
  The very nature of this authority includes combating hostile militia ,Public
and armed proxies acting within Iraq against American forces. That is ,Public
  The authorization to use military force did not end with the defeat ,Public
of Saddam Hussein any more than the President's military authority in ,Public
Japan and Germany ended with the defeat of Hirohito and Hitler.,Public
  In those cases the President's authority didn't terminate until 1952 ,Public
and 1955 respectively and the President's military authority in Iraq ,Public
remains in effect until the President and Congress terminate it.,Public
  Now the second misunderstanding is that the President's action was ,Public
an attack on Iran. It most certainly was not. It was carried out in the ,Public
theater of war defined by Congress against a combatant who was ,Public
commanding hostile forces against American troops.,Public
  Not only did the President act entirely within his legal authority as ,Public
Commander in Chief but within his moral responsibility to protect ,Public
American military and diplomatic personnel and American citizens in ,Public
  The third misunderstanding is that the War Powers Act is applicable ,Public
in this circumstance. The War Powers Act governs only those ,Public
circumstances when the President responds without congressional ,Public
authority to an attack upon the United States its territory or ,Public
possessions or its Armed Forces. In this case the President already ,Public
  The fourth misunderstanding is that the attack on Soleimani was ,Public
equivalent to President Obama's attack on Libya. The two are entirely ,Public
different matters. The attack on Libya had no congressional ,Public
authorization and the War Powers Act did not apply because Mr. Obama's ,Public
military attack was not in response to an attack on the United States ,Public
  It was an entirely unprovoked attack entirely unauthorized and ,Public
  I think as we go forward we need to get back to some basic ,Public
fundamental understandings about the constitutional parameters of war ,Public
  The American Founders made a sharp distinction between starting a war ,Public
and waging a war for some very good reasons. They understood that this ,Public
most solemn and lethal decision should not be entrusted to one ,Public
individual whose authority would be greatly augmented by it.,Public
  The decision to start a war was given exclusively to Congress to ,Public
assure that every voice in the country was heard and that Congress ,Public
once having taken that stand would be obligated to put the resources ,Public
of the country behind that war and those fighting it.,Public
  But once the war has begun the Founders wanted a single Commander in ,Public
Chief directing it with clear and unambiguous authority. There is no ,Public
surer path to military disaster than having 535 squabbling prima donnas ,Public
  Thus the President can wage war but cannot declare it and the ,Public
  The Founders debated these principles thoroughly during the ,Public
Constitutional Convention. They recognized that the President did need ,Public
certain residual military power to repel an attack when Congress ,Public
couldn't act. And I believe the War Powers Act faithfully defines these ,Public
circumstances and establishes a framework to contain them.,Public
  But the War Powers Act does not give the President the authority to,Public
launch military attacks except in response to a direct attack on our ,Public
country nor can it limit the President's authority as Commander in ,Public
  I believe the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force in ,Public
Iraq was a colossal mistake. It created a dangerous power vacuum. It ,Public
was never supported with the full resources of the United States and ,Public
  But there should be no rewriting of history here. It might have been ,Public
George W. Bush who advocated for the war and Bush Obama and now ,Public
President Trump who have waged it but it was Congress' adoption of the ,Public
  And once started only the President can wage it. President Trump ,Public
inherited this mess and history will judge how well he handles it. ,Public
Certainly in this instance the President not only had clear and ,Public
unambiguous authority to order the attack he had a moral imperative to ,Public
  What is crystal clear from the debate yesterday is that if the ,Public
Democrats had had their way Soleimani would be alive today and the ,Public
attack on American troops that he was in the final stages of planning ,Public
would have unfolded. We would likely today be mourning very many ,Public
  If the President knowing that this attack was coming and in full ,Public
possession of the opportunity and the authority to stop it had taken ,Public
the Democrats' advice and done nothing he would have been deeply ,Public
culpable for the loss of these Americans. It is shocking to me and ,Public
perhaps to the country as well that even in hindsight this is the ,Public
course the Democrats have made clear that they prefer.,Public
  That brings me to the nature of the resolution that the House passed ,Public
yesterday. The separation of war powers between the legislative and ,Public
executive branches has been badly blurred in recent decades and I do ,Public
believe that we need to reestablish not only the constitutional ,Public
principles that separate the declaring of war from the waging of war ,Public
but also the American tradition that we only go to war when we have ,Public
  When we must go to war we have the utmost obligation to put the ,Public
entire might and resources and attention of the Nation behind it and ,Public
  Now that is a legitimate debate to have but that is not what the ,Public
House did yesterday. Yesterday it deliberately and recklessly ,Public
undermined the position of the United States Government and the United ,Public
States Armed Forces that we sent to Iraq shredding the tradition that ,Public
  In a perilous moment the House refused to stand behind the war that ,Public
it had authorized in 2002 refused to protect the men and women that it ,Public
placed in harm's way and it gave a hostile foreign power a major ,Public
  That is yet another stain upon the honor of this House and one which ,Public
should be deplored and condemned through the ages to come.,Public
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov],Public
  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President on another matter this week we ,Public
expect the Senate will take up a War Powers Resolution by the junior ,Public
Senator from Virginia that would severely limit the U.S. military's ,Public
operational flexibility to defend itself against threats posed by Iran. ,Public
I will strongly oppose our colleague's effort and urge the Senate to ,Public
  First let's discuss what prompted this: the President's successful ,Public
decision to remove Soleimani from the battlefield last month. This ,Public
limited yet decisive precision strike eliminated the terrorist ,Public
mastermind who had been responsible for more American military ,Public
  This was not some reckless act. It was a calculated and limited ,Public
response to a significant growing threat of attack against U.S. ,Public
personnel in Iraq by an emboldened adversary. Years ago Soleimani had ,Public
concluded America was a paper tiger whose people he could kill with ,Public
relative impunity. It was a strike designed to stop an escalation cycle ,Public
we all knew was underway and to restore deterrence and reduce the risk ,Public
  Yet when Soleimani's record of brutality was brought to an end some ,Public
Washington Democrats immediately suggested President Trump was leading ,Public
us into World War III. While the Middle East masses rejoiced at the ,Public
death of a principal architect of Iran's campaign of terror the ,Public
  Yet thus far it appears the Soleimani strike has indeed had the ,Public
intended effect. As I observed back in January ``We appear to have ,Public
restored a measure of deterrence in the Middle East. So let's not screw ,Public
it up.'' Well I am afraid that is just what our colleague's resolution ,Public
would do. Just as we have successfully sent Iran the strong signal of ,Public
our strength and resolve a blunt and clumsy War Powers Resolution ,Public
  With China's and Russia's watching is it really a good idea to ,Public
suggest that we are willing to let a meddling power like Iran push us ,Public
around? This self-flagellation and self-limitation would be tantamount ,Public
  For 8 years President Obama and Senate Democrats like my friend the ,Public
Democratic leader himself frequently said that when it comes to Iran ,Public
we should never take the military option off the table. Yet now that ,Public
someone else is in the Oval Office they seem to want to remove all ,Public
options from the table. Lest we forget the fact is that we are not ,Public
conducting ongoing hostilities with Iran. This was a one-off operation ,Public
to disrupt and deter planned attacks--not a campaign not a conflict ,Public
  This discrete and limited exercise of American power pales in ,Public
comparison to the ways in which past Presidents of both parties have ,Public
routinely used Presidential authorities to utilize our military might ,Public
without their having the prior consent of Congress--President Clinton ,Public
  Do most of my distinguished Democratic colleagues really agree with ,Public
several of their party's leading Presidential candidates who have ,Public
suggested President Trump made a mistake by taking this sort of ,Public
Executive action to eliminate this brutal terrorist?,Public
  Do my colleagues really agree with the prominent voices on their side ,Public
who have proposed to exit the Middle East altogether rather than to ,Public
continue to work to support our local partners and defend our national ,Public
security and national interests in this critical region?,Public
  I have been trying to have this broader debate for more than a year ,Public
now. I have repeatedly sought to give my Democratic colleagues the ,Public
opportunity to go on record about their actual big-picture strategic ,Public
  Are they willing to support a continued military presence in Syria? ,Public
in Iraq? Do they believe we can magically support our partners like ,Public
the Kurds without having a military presence; that we can counter ,Public
Iranian and Russian influence if we are nowhere to be found in the ,Public
region? Do they believe Israel will be safer in a region without ,Public
  Ill-conceived potshots at Presidential authorities--in the wake of a ,Public
strike that succeeded--by using the blunt instrument of a War Powers ,Public
Resolution is no substitute at all for answering these broader ,Public
  I will oppose my colleague's resolution tomorrow and I encourage our ,Public

  The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. ,Public
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker undeniably the worst foreign policy ,Public
mistake in the history of the United States of America was the invasion ,Public
of Iraq based on phonied-up intelligence that was trumpeted by Dick ,Public
Cheney Scooter Libby and other characters in the Bush administration.,Public
  But just this last week President Trump took us to the verge of an ,Public
even worse foreign policy mistake in the Middle East. He recklessly and ,Public
impatiently took us to the brink of war that would have been even ,Public
  Now yesterday I went to the so-called intelligence briefing. They ,Public
offered no intelligence regarding immediate imminent threats to the ,Public
  They did certainly make a case that Soleimani was a rotten guy and he ,Public
was responsible for many many deaths of Americans and others in the ,Public
region but that is all recited past history that didn't talk about any ,Public
immediate threats or any intelligence that would lead to it.,Public
  They further went on to say that the legal justification was the ,Public
Authorization for Use of Military Force in the invasion of Iraq which ,Public
of course was based on phony intelligence regarding weapons of mass ,Public
destruction he didn't have. So that is even more extraordinary if you ,Public
  Last week also the President tweeted what he said was his ,Public
compliance with war powers. He then went on to tweet a threat of all-,Public
out war against Iran and then he went further to tweet that he would ,Public
order that war crimes be committed during an all-out war against Iran.,Public
  That was walked back a little bit by the Secretary of Defense who ,Public
said they would follow the law. And then Trump later said: I like laws. ,Public
I will follow the laws. So he walked back from saying he was going to ,Public
  Today on the floor of the House we will take up a rebuke of the ,Public
President for those actions. Hopefully we will go further and we will ,Public
repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force from 2002 based on ,Public
  We will further hopefully take up legislation that was adopted as ,Public
an amendment to the defense authorization last summer with bipartisan ,Public
support to say that the President couldn't initiate hostilities ,Public
  Congress has the authority and only Congress has the authority to ,Public
declare war. Once we are at war the President as Commander in Chief ,Public
  But the President does not have the authority. This is ,Public
extraconstitutional when it isn't an attack or an imminent attack on ,Public
  Further we need to fix the War Powers Act. That was adopted after ,Public
the illegal actions of another President Richard Nixon the bombing of ,Public
  There were two versions. One followed the Constitution and said no ,Public
no any offensive actions into hostilities you first have to come to ,Public
Congress. The second version said well you can initiate them but you ,Public
have to report within 48 hours and if Congress doesn't authorize it ,Public
within 60 days you have to withdraw. That was defective and weak and ,Public
doesn't reflect at all the congressional duties of this body.,Public
  Now I know a lot of Members love to dodge the issues of war and ,Public
peace--it is the toughest vote you can make--and that is essentially ,Public
what they did at the time a wink and a nod: Well we will let the ,Public
President do these things. Hey if it works out we will take credit; ,Public
if it doesn't work out oh well then we can castigate him later.,Public
  So I have introduced yet again a bill that comprehensively reforms ,Public
the War Powers Act to reflect the constitutional authorities and duties ,Public
of the United States Congress. It would say that the President cannot ,Public
initiate hostilities without first coming to Congress.,Public
  It would define what consultation means. It doesn't mean a tweet to ,Public
the Congress. It doesn't mean sending up a letter. It means a ,Public
meaningful consultation. It establishes an executive legislative ,Public
  It also includes most importantly a sunset clause for any ,Public
  I mean a thousand years from now the United States I guess if we ,Public
don't repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force can ,Public
attack whatever Iraq is a thousand years from now. That is absolutely ,Public
  Finally it does give Congress the authority and standing to go to ,Public
the courts should the President violate the Constitution and the War ,Public
  I have had problems with both Democratic and Rean Presidents ,Public
over this issue over the years: Clinton Bosnia; Bush obviously in a ,Public
number of cases; and then Obama in Libya and other things that they ,Public
did also based on the fake intelligence in the 2002 authorization.,Public
  So let's first vote today. That is just a starting point in ,Public
From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov],Public
  Mr. COTTON. Madam President in the next few days Senate Democrats ,Public
will move to discharge a War Powers Resolution to tie the President's ,Public
hands in defending this Nation against Iran and terrorist masterminds ,Public
like Qasem Soleimani. Let's think about how we got here and the ,Public
  Qasem Soleimani has the blood of thousands of Americans on his hands ,Public
and hundreds of thousands of innocent souls across the Middle East. For ,Public
more than 20 years he was the Supreme Leader's most trusted ,Public
lieutenant Iran's terror mastermind and the man responsible for the ,Public
deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan by ,Public
supplying the most deadly kinds of roadside bombs soldiers ever faced. ,Public
He and his proxies and Iranian leaders like him are responsible for ,Public
bombings of our Embassies in places like Lebanon and Kuwait. They are ,Public
in no small part responsible for the ongoing horror of the Syrian ,Public
civil war for the civil war in Yemen. There is no doubt based on the ,Public
intelligence we have and this bloodthirsty past that Qasem Soleimani ,Public
was in Baghdad on January 2 to plot something very dangerous and very ,Public
big that was going to target Americans once again.,Public
  We should all be thankful that Qasem Soleimani no longer walks the ,Public
Earth and we should be proud of the troops who executed that mission. ,Public
The world is a safer place and America is a safer nation because of it. ,Public
The people of Iran have been given a voice against the man who was ,Public
responsible for mowing them down in protests over the years and whose ,Public
death they have been out on the streets celebrating even though they ,Public
risk being mowed down by their own security forces once again.,Public
  Yet over the last 2 weeks the Democrats have been able to do ,Public
nothing but express their regret for the President's decision to ,Public
eliminate Qasem Soleimani. And make no mistake--this War Powers ,Public
Resolution is not about the future; it is about delivering an implicit ,Public
or if you listen to their words and don't just read the resolution an ,Public
explicit rebuke to the President for ordering the killing of Qasem ,Public
Soleimani. They certainly want to prevent the President from doing ,Public
anything like that in the future. That is why they have introduced this ,Public
  We should always remind ourselves when we are having a war powers ,Public
debate as we do from time to time the War Powers Resolution is ,Public
unconstitutional. It was passed by a liberal Congress in 1973 at the ,Public
height of Watergate and not a single President since then has ,Public
acknowledged its constitutionality--not a single one to include all ,Public
  I hear a lot about the Constitution these days and reclaiming our ,Public
authority to declare war and to constrain the Executive. I guess all ,Public
those constitutional experts missed the Federalist Papers and their ,Public
authoritative explanation of the Constitution and why we have the ,Public
government we do. We have a House of Representatives with 435 people to ,Public
be the institution that is most closely tied to popular opinion. We ,Public
have a Senate to act as the cool and deliberate sense of community. And ,Public
we have a single President--a single President--to act on behalf of the ,Public
  Federalist 70 if they would just open up that authoritative ,Public
explanation of the Constitution says why there is one President not a ,Public
council of two or three or four as some of the States had at the time ,Public
of the founding. Because of the division of opinion and perspective and ,Public
temperament that an executive council would have there is one ,Public
President--one President--who can act as Federalist 70 said with ,Public
energy and dispatch and yes in some occasions with secrecy. So if ,Public
the Founders didn't think we should have an executive council of 3 or 4 ,Public
or 5 people imagine what they would have thought about 535 commanders ,Public
in chief making operational decisions about when to take action on the ,Public
  These debates about War Powers Resolutions are really about how many ,Public
lawyers and armchair rangers can dance on the head of a pin. Do you ,Public
think wars and battles are won with paper resolutions? Those wars and ,Public
battles are won with iron resolution. Do you think the ayatollahs are ,Public
intimidated by ``whereas'' clauses and joint resolutions? The ,Public
ayatollahs are intimidated deterred and scared when we incinerate ,Public
their terror mastermind and we tell them that we will do it again if ,Public
  Even if you grant the War Powers Resolution constitutional look at ,Public
the actual text of this resolution. It makes no exception for Iran ,Public
developing a nuclear weapon. The ayatollahs could hold a press ,Public
conference tomorrow or the Supreme Leader could tweet that they are ,Public
going to rush to a nuclear breakout. The President would have to come ,Public
to Congress if he would want to take any kind of action to deter it. It ,Public
makes no exception for designated terrorist organizations and ,Public
individuals like the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Quds ,Public
Force who have killed so many Americans and continue to target them ,Public
today. It makes no exception for attacks on our allies in the Middle ,Public
  The sponsor of this resolution will say: Oh it makes an exception ,Public
  We have seen what that gets us over the last couple of weeks--again ,Public
lawyers and armchair rangers arguing about the meaning of ,Public
``imminence.'' Well I have to say that whether an attack is imminent ,Public
looks pretty different if you are a soldier on patrol in Iraq than if ,Public
you are a comfortable Senator sitting behind secure walls and armed ,Public
  None of this means Congress has no role in matters of life and death ,Public
on the battlefield. It is very far from it in fact and I will take a ,Public
back seat to no one in asserting that constitutional authority. I would ,Public
remind my colleagues that when we had an opportunity to insist that ,Public
Barack Obama's nuclear deal with Iran be submitted to this Chamber as a ,Public
treaty there was one Senator who voted to insist on that--only one. ,Public
This guy. Ninety-eight other Senators were perfectly willing to create ,Public
some made-up phony-baloney procedure that allowed Barack Obama to ,Public
submit a nuclear arms agreement with a sworn and mortal enemy that ,Public
chants ``Death to America'' and put it into effect with a large ,Public
majority opposed to him as opposed to the two-thirds majority that our ,Public
  We do have a tremendous degree of constitutional authority in the ,Public
Congress. We regulate interstate commerce which means sanctions. We ,Public
confirm Ambassadors. We confirm the President's Cabinet. We declare ,Public
war which we have done only a few times in our past despite hundreds ,Public
of instances of introducing troops. But most importantly and the way ,Public
to constrain the Executive if this Congress thinks he should be ,Public
constrained in a particular case we have the spending power--in ,Public
particular the spending power for our Armed Forces. That is the way ,Public
the Congress--any Congress with any President--can control the use of ,Public
the Armed Forces by the President. It is something this Congress has ,Public
done a lot in the past. We did it in Vietnam did it in Nicaragua and ,Public
  There were plenty of times where the President has acted in some ways ,Public
in a much more aggressive and far-reaching fashion than President Trump ,Public
did just a couple weeks ago--the first Taiwan Strait crisis Granada in ,Public
1983 Libya in 1986 and Iran in 1988. I would even say Libya again in ,Public
2011 although most of my Democratic colleagues like to send that down ,Public
the memory hole since it was a Democratic President.,Public
  So I would simply say that if you disagree with the President's ,Public
decision to kill the world's most sadistic bloodthirsty terrorist ,Public
mastermind and you want to stop him from doing so again file your bill ,Public
to prohibit the use of any taxpayer funds for such operations. It is ,Public
very simple. It is one page. I will help you write it if you need ,Public
help--one page: No funds will be used to support operations by the ,Public
Armed Forces against the Government of Iran or any of its officials. Do ,Public
  Why are we not seeing that bill? Because it failed just last year. ,Public
All of these same politicians offered language on our annual Defense ,Public
bill to try to prohibit the use of any funds in operations like we just ,Public
saw and it failed. We passed a defense bill as we always do by ,Public
overwhelming majorities which means they don't have the votes because ,Public
they know their position is not popular with the American people. Not ,Public
surprisingly the American people don't want their elected leaders to ,Public
  So if you are not going to act in what is our true constitutional ,Public
power spare us the unconstitutional and dangerous War Powers ,Public
Resolutions and simply let the people who are serious about our ,Public
national security--from troops on up to the top--do what is necessary ,Public

dangerous and partisan resolution offered by my Democrat colleagues ,Public
designed to handcuff our President and limit his constitutional ,Public
authorities as Commander in Chief to defend our Nation against Iranian ,Public
  The resolution before us today needlessly politicizes our national ,Public
security and shows that Democrats have once again put their partisan ,Public
agenda ahead of the American people simply because they do not like ,Public
  Let's be clear. President Trump's decisive and defensive action to ,Public
eliminate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force commander ,Public
Qasem Soleimani is not the reason for the recent escalation between ,Public
the United States and Iran. The President ordered the strike because of ,Public
Iran's own escalation and aggression for which General Soleimani was ,Public
  For over 40 years Iran and it proxies have been attacking U.S. ,Public
interests and our allies but since the flawed Iran nuclear deal under ,Public
which the regime received billions of dollars in sanctions relief the ,Public
Islamic re has used that economic windfall to accelerate its ,Public
support for terrorist proxies restart its ballistic missile program--,Public
in violation of U.N. resolutions--and cheat on its denuclearization ,Public
  My colleagues have heard the quote of the late Senator Arthur ,Public
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that: ``We must stop ,Public
  Senator Vandenberg a Rean who worked across the aisle with ,Public
Democrat President Truman in the early days of the Cold War was right.,Public
  This resolution is not safeguarding our Constitution but attacking ,Public
our Constitution by attempting to divest a duly elected President of ,Public
his Commander in Chief powers and in the process emboldening our ,Public
  In fact President Trump has demonstrated enormous restraint in his ,Public
targeted action against Soleimani making this vote entirely ,Public
unnecessary. There was no invasion of Iran but a strike against a ,Public
terrorist in a country we had the legal authority to operate in under ,Public
the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military Force.,Public
  Mr. Speaker you have heard many of my colleagues doubt the ,Public
applicability of that AUMF so for those colleagues who are unconvinced ,Public
that that is a sufficient authority consider the fact that even in the ,Public
absence of explicit congressional authorization for the Soleimani ,Public
strike here is a helpful reminder: Article II Section 2 of the ,Public
Constitution provides that: The President shall be Commander in Chief. ,Public
And it is true that the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to ,Public
declare war and the sole power of the purse to either fund or defund ,Public
military action but dating back to the Prize cases in 1863 the ,Public
Supreme Court has long held that the President may act without Congress ,Public
  In recent years the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel has ,Public
opined that the Constitution authorizes the President as Commander in ,Public
Chief to order military action without congressional permission if the ,Public
President determines that the action would be anticipatory self-defense ,Public
or otherwise serves the interest of the United States at least where ,Public

  The courts have generally declined to review the exercise of such ,Public

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President H. Con. Res. 83 directs the President to ,Public
terminate the use of U.S. Armed Forces to engage in hostilities against ,Public
Iran unless Congress has authorized the use of military force against ,Public
Iran or such use is necessary to defend against an imminent armed ,Public
attack. H. Con. Res. 83 was agreed to in the House of Representatives ,Public
on January 9 2020 and received in the Senate and referred to the ,Public
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on January 132020,Public
  The War Powers Resolution PL 93-148 has special procedures ,Public
underscoring the privileged nature of a concurrent resolution like H. ,Public
Con. Res. 83. Section 1546(c) of the War Powers Resolution requires ,Public
that once a privileged concurrent resolution such as H. Con. Res. 83 ,Public
has been passed by the House it must be referred to the Senate Foreign ,Public
Relations Committee and ``shall be reported out by such committee ,Public
together with its recommendations within fifteen calendar days.'' ,Public
days from January 13 is today January 28 2020. Under the law the ,Public
concurrent resolution may be reported out with a favorable or ,Public
unfavorable recommendation or no recommendation at all but it must be ,Public
  Unfortunately it appears that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ,Public
majority leadership has decided to allow the 15 calendar days to lapse ,Public
without taking action on H. Con. Res. 83. This failure to act leaves a ,Public
  I understand that the chairman is basing this inaction primarily on ,Public
the contention that a concurrent resolution under 50 U.S.C. 1544(c) may ,Public
be privileged only if it uses the word ``remove'' or the phrase ,Public
``removal of United States Armed Forces engaged in hostilities'' ,Public
rather than ``terminate'' or ``terminate the use of United States Armed ,Public
Forces to engage in hostilities'' as used in H. Con. Res. 83. The ,Public
argument appears to be that the use of ``removed'' in 1544(c) of the ,Public
War Powers Resolution eliminates the possibility of privilege if any ,Public
other terminology is used regardless of functional equivalency. This ,Public
argument suggests that ``removal'' is a term of art required for ,Public
  The approach is unjustifiably restrictive. Treating ``removal'' as a ,Public
term of art required for privilege is inconsistent with the overarching ,Public
purpose of the War Powers Resolution and without support in either the ,Public
statutory framework or legislative history. It also undermines Senate ,Public
  The purpose of the War Powers Resolution was for Congress to ,Public
reconfirm and reassert its constitutional powers over ``undeclared'' ,Public
wars. The availability of a privileged and binding resolution to force ,Public
a President to stop using U.S. Armed Forces in hostilities is central ,Public
to that purpose. Limiting such privilege to a single phrase or word is ,Public
inconsistent with this reassertion of congressional powers and is ,Public
neither a feature of the statute nor its legislative history.,Public
  The statutory framework of the War Powers Resolution does not support ,Public
the assertion that ``removal'' or ``removal from hostilities'' are ,Public
terms of art that are required for and exclusive to the availability of ,Public
privilege. To the contrary those terms are not defined in law; nor is ,Public
there any reference in the statute to a military or other usage of ,Public
those phrases to suggest that they are terms of art.,Public
  The absence of statutorily mandated language for privilege in the War ,Public
Powers Resolution directly contrasts with many other statutes in which ,Public
Congress expressly requires specific language for privilege to attach. ,Public
For example in contrast to the War Powers Resolution section 130(f) ,Public
of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 PL 83-703 section 101 of the Arms ,Public
Export Control Act PL 90-629 and section 216(c) of the Countering ,Public
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act PL 115-44 all require ,Public
specific text for privileged resolutions and provide that text in ,Public
quotations in the statute. Clearly as evidenced by laws enacted before ,Public
and after the War Powers Resolution Congress knows how to require the ,Public
use of unique statutorily mandated language for privilege to apply. ,Public
The fact that it did not do so in the War Powers Resolution ,Public
demonstrates that there was no intent to limit privilege to use of a ,Public
  Further the legislative record of the War Powers Resolution does not ,Public
support the assertion that there is an exclusive connection between the ,Public
use of ``removal'' and the availability of privilege. To the contrary ,Public
the record indicates that ``remove'' and ``terminate'' were used ,Public
synonymously. The record is replete with the interchangeable usage of ,Public
synonymous terms consistent with a cessation of the use of U.S. forces ,Public
in hostilities. For example House Report 93-287 uses no less than ,Public
seven terms in this regard including ``conclude'' ``disengage'' ,Public
``remove'' ``terminate'' ``abandon such action'' and ``stop.'' In ,Public
fact the conferees even used ``terminate'' to describe the privileged ,Public
resolution envisioned in 1544(c) clearly demonstrating that these ,Public
terms were considered to be functionally equivalent for purposes of War ,Public
Powers. ``The House joint resolution provided that use of United States ,Public
Armed Forces by the President without a declaration of war or specific ,Public
statutory authorization could be terminated by Congress through the use ,Public
of a concurrent resolution. The Senate amendment provided for such ,Public
termination by a bill or joint resolution.'' H. Rept. 93-547 ,Public
Conference Report to H.J. Res. 542. This legislative history in tandem ,Public
with a statutory construct that does not require a term of art ,Public
demonstrates that the insistence on such a term for privilege is ,Public
  Finally strictly limiting privilege to a resolution that uses ,Public
``remove'' is inconsistent with Senate and congressional perogatives. ,Public
The purpose of the War Powers Resolution--reasserting the power of ,Public
Congress over undeclared wars--can be vindicated only if the executive ,Public
branch and its supporters in the Senate cannot use committee or floor ,Public
procedure to bottle up a resolution consistent with both the purpose ,Public
and construct of the War Powers Resolution. Reading into the statute a ,Public
requirement for specific terminology where no such requirement exists ,Public
unjustifiably restricts Senate action and limits the reassertion of ,Public
  For the reasons stated above I urge the chairman to immediately take ,Public
the necessary steps to ensure full compliance with the law.,Public

  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President I rise to express a concern over the ,Public
Rubio amendment to the Sanders-Lee joint resolution S.J. Res. 7 which ,Public
  The Rubio amendment attempts to make clear that nothing in the joint ,Public
resolution is intended or may be interpreted to affect any intelligence ,Public
or counterintelligence activity or investigations relating to threats ,Public
in or from Yemen which involves the collection analysis or sharing ,Public
  I do not believe that it was the intention of the authors of S.J. ,Public
Res. 7 to restrict these intelligence activities per se. I believe it ,Public
was Senator Rubio's intention to make sure that that legitimate ,Public
intelligence activities as specified were not affected.,Public
  However my concern springs from the full implications of what ,Public
``sharing intelligence'' means. I assume it is meant to share useful ,Public
intelligence the United States may acquire about the intentions ,Public
activities characteristics and other information about for example ,Public
the Houthis or Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That is entirely ,Public
  But if the intelligence being shared is actually information that ,Public
allows Saudi Arabia or other members of the Saudi-led coalition to ,Public
specifically target and conduct military operations such as ,Public
airstrikes against specific sites in Yemen then that would get ,Public
perilously close to the U.S. being directly involved in hostilities in ,Public
  Section 8 of the War Powers Resolution considers U.S. Armed Forces to ,Public
be ``introduced into hostilities'' if among other activities members ,Public
of the U.S. Armed Forces ``coordinate'' the activities of foreign ,Public
forces. Arguably enabling Saudi forces to target specific sites in ,Public
Yemen could constitute ``coordination'' under the War Powers ,Public
  Why is this important? It is important first to preserve the scope ,Public
of application of the War Powers Resolution which the Congress enacted ,Public
to rein in the power of the executive branch to make war anywhere under ,Public
  Second the more direct assistance U.S. Armed Forces provide to the ,Public
Saudi-led coalition the closer they are associated with the actions of ,Public
those countries. That could lead to shared liability in those ,Public
activities if and when those activities lead inadvertently or ,Public
  Again I do not believe that it was the intention of the author of ,Public
this amendment to create the legal space for this to occur. I would ,Public

agencies to be mindful of this issue and be cautious about what ,Public
intelligence information is shared and for what purposes it is used.,Public

  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President last week we were very close to an act of ,Public
war between the United States and Iran. I must tell you we have been ,Public
talking about this potential threat for a long time. I am a member of ,Public
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We have held numerous meetings ,Public
in our discussion about the fact that there is no authorization for the ,Public
use of military force by the United States against Iran that has been ,Public
approved by Congress. I remember during hearings listening to ,Public
administrative witnesses who said: Well there is no intent to use ,Public
  Well Congress did not act. Even though I must tell you several of ,Public
our colleagues including this Senator had urged us to take up an ,Public
authorization for the use of military force in regards to the problems ,Public
in the Middle East there was no action taken. I want to applaud ,Public
Senator Kaine who has been working on this for several years and our ,Public
former colleague Senator Flake who did everything they could to bring ,Public
a bipartisan discussion and action in regards to exercising ,Public
congressional responsibility on the use of force by our military.,Public
  Well we now know that this is a real threat that we may be going to ,Public
war without Congress's involvement which is contrary not only to our ,Public
Constitution but to the laws passed by the U.S. Congress. So I want to ,Public
thank Senator Kaine and Senator Lee for filing S.J. Res. 68 a ,Public
bipartisan resolution. I hope it will receive the expedited process ,Public
that is envisioned in the War Powers Resolution and I hope that we ,Public
will have a chance to act on this in the next few days. It is our ,Public
responsibility--Congress's responsibility--to commit our troops to ,Public
combat and it rests squarely with the legislative branch of ,Public
  Let me first cite the Constitution of the United States. You hear a ,Public
lot of discussion about the Constitution here on the floor of the U.S. ,Public
Senate. Article I section 8 of the Constitution says that Congress ,Public
  Now that was challenged in the 1970s after Congress had passed the ,Public
Gulf of Tonkin resolution in regards to our presence in Vietnam.,Public
  It was passed in an innocent way to protect American troops and ships ,Public
that were in that region but as we know that resolution was used as ,Public
justification by President Johnson and others to expand our involvement ,Public
in Vietnam and ultimately led to a very active and costly war for the ,Public
  In 1973 Congress passed the War Powers Act. It wasn't easy. ,Public
President Nixon vetoed it. We overrode the veto in a bipartisan vote in ,Public
the U.S. Congress. We did that because of the abuse of power during the ,Public
  Let me read what the War Powers Act provides because it is very ,Public
telling in regard to what we saw last week in regard to Iran a little ,Public
over a week ago now. It requires consultation with Congress by the ,Public
President ``in every possible instance before committing troops to ,Public
war.'' No. 1 it requires the President to consult with us before he ,Public
commits any of our troops to an engagement. No. 2 the President is ,Public
required to report within 48 hours ``into hostilities or into ,Public
situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly ,Public
indicated by the circumstances.'' So it provides for the imminent ,Public
  No. 3 the President is ``required to end foreign military action ,Public
after 60 days unless Congress provides a declaration of war or an ,Public
  We now know that to be an AUMF an authorization for the use of ,Public
  Let's fast forward from the passage of that bill in 1973 to rein in ,Public
the abuse of power by the Executive during the Vietnam war. Let's fast ,Public
forward to what happened in early January on January 2 when President ,Public
Trump ordered the action against Soleimani in Baghdad and took out his ,Public
  Let me start off by saying none of us has any sorrow over the loss ,Public
of General Soleimani. He was a bad guy. He was responsible for the ,Public
deaths of hundreds of people. He was very much a person who should have ,Public
been held accountable for his activities but there is a reason for our ,Public
constitutional protections of checks and balances as it relates to the ,Public
  The Commander in Chief has certain powers. Congress has certain ,Public
powers. The Framers of our Constitution intentionally provided for ,Public
there to be a robust discussion and debate between the legislature and ,Public
the Executive on war and peace; that we should have that open ,Public
discussion; and that in many cases diplomacy needs to be pursued much ,Public
more aggressively before we use our military might; that our national ,Public
security interest in keeping America safe rests with these checks and ,Public
balances. Again to bring it to current times in regard to the ,Public
circumstances with Iran every witness I have listened to every expert ,Public
I have talked to with regard to the Middle East says it is in the U.S. ,Public
national security interest to find a diplomatic way to handle our ,Public
issues in regard to Iran; that a military option would be very costly ,Public
a long time and most likely counterproductive with the United States ,Public
having to keep its troops in that region for a very long time.,Public
  Diplomacy is clearly the preferred path. These constitutional ,Public
provisions provide us with an opportunity to be able to make sure we do ,Public
what is in the best interest of American national security.,Public
  Trump ordered this attack and the Senate now needs to act as we saw ,Public
in the 1970s when Congress did act. Let me start with the War Powers ,Public
Act and how President Trump had violated the War Powers Act in all ,Public
  First was there an imminent involvement or threat? We have all now ,Public
heard the explanations given by this administration. It was short on ,Public
detail. It was basically the general concerns. What is most disturbing ,Public
we now read press accounts that the President had been planning for ,Public
months--or the generals had been planning and going over with the ,Public
President for months whether they should take out General Soleimani.,Public
  If they had been planning for months why didn't they consult with ,Public
Congress as required under the War Powers Act? Violation No. 1 to the ,Public
War Powers Act: Congress was not consulted by President Trump.,Public
  No. 2 there are two violations so far; the fact that there wasn't an ,Public
imminent threat and the fact that there was no consultation with ,Public
Congress--two violations of the War Powers Act. Then if he continues ,Public
to use force beyond the 60 days he has to come to Congress and get ,Public
  Does anyone here believe the President will not hesitate again to use ,Public
force against Iran? Yet there are no intentions to submit a resolution.,Public
  We find the President has violated the War Powers Act in three ways: ,Public
first by having no evidence of imminent threat; second by not ,Public
consulting with Congress before the attack; and third by not ,Public
submitting to us an authorization for the use of military force.,Public
  There are some who say the President already has that authority under ,Public
the authorizations for the use of military force that were passed by ,Public
Congress after the attack on our country on September 112001,Public
  We are getting to 18 years beyond when that attack took place and ,Public
those authorizations passed but let me go through them. The one that ,Public
is cited the most by the President is the 2002 which is to ``defend ,Public
the national security of the United States against the continuing ,Public
  First let me say I voted against that resolution and I believe ,Public
that was the correct vote but I think almost everybody in this body ,Public
would say that authorization is no longer relevant. Since that ,Public
resolution was passed the United States has worked with Iraq and has ,Public
worked with the Government of Iraq. This is a country we try to do ,Public
business with so they no longer present the threat that was supposedly ,Public
present when this resolution was passed. Even to get beyond that what ,Public
does Iran have to do with Iraq? I understand they may start with the ,Public
first letter ``I'' but there is no relationship here. Under any ,Public
stretch of the imagination there is no way you can use the 2002 ,Public
  Let's go to the 2001 resolution that was passed on the authorization ,Public
for use of military force. That was immediately after the attack on ,Public
September 11: `` . . . to use all necessary and appropriate force ,Public
against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned ,Public
authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on ,Public
Sep-112001 or harbored such organizations or persons.'',Public
  There is absolutely zero connection between that language and General ,Public
Soleimani or Iran as it relates to 9/11 and I think no one could make ,Public
  I understand that 2001 has been misused by many administrations. ,Public
There is no question I would concur in that conclusion but in all of ,Public
those cases they tried to connect dots. There is no connection of dots ,Public
  As we saw in the late 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam when we had the ,Public
Gulf of Tonkin resolution that was passed to defend our assets in the ,Public
Vietnam area--in the Gulf of Tonkin--how it was used by administrations ,Public
to commit us to a long engaged military operations. Here one cannot ,Public
argue that there is even a semblance of authorization that has been ,Public
  We also know the President is violating the War Powers Act and he is ,Public
likely to use force again in violation of our Constitution and the War ,Public
  It was my generation that paid a very heavy price because of the ,Public
Vietnam war. I lost a lot of my high school classmates in the Vietnam ,Public
war. Let us not exceed our responsibility under the Constitution or ,Public
allow the President to exceed his. We need to act. The Senate needs to ,Public
  The resolution before us allows us to do what is responsible. I am ,Public
going to quote from the resolution that Senator Kaine has filed S.J. ,Public
Res. 68: `` . . . the President to terminate the use of United States ,Public
Armed Forces for hostilities against . . . Iran or any part of its ,Public
government or military unless explicitly authorized by a declaration ,Public
of war or specific authorization for use of military force against ,Public
  By the way the resolution also provides that we always have the ,Public

an imminent threat and that we comply with the War Powers Act--I am ,Public

  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker pursuant to House Resolution 781 I call up ,Public
the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 83) directing the President ,Public
pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution to terminate the ,Public
use of United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or ,Public

  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 781 the ,Public
amendment printed in House Report 116-371 is adopted and the ,Public
concurrent resolution as amended is considered read.,Public
  The text of the concurrent resolution as amended is as follows:,Public
       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate ,Public
     SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES ,Public
       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:,Public
       (1) The Government of Iran is a leading state sponsor of ,Public
     terrorism and engages in a range of destabilizing activities ,Public
     across the Middle East. Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was ,Public
     the lead architect of much of Iran's destabilizing activities ,Public
       (2) The United States has an inherent right to self-defense ,Public
     against imminent armed attacks. The United States maintains ,Public
     the right to ensure the safety of diplomatic personnel ,Public
       (3) In matters of imminent armed attacks the executive ,Public
     branch should indicate to Congress why military action was ,Public
     necessary within a certain window of opportunity the ,Public
     possible harm that missing the window would cause and why ,Public
     the action was likely to prevent future disastrous attacks ,Public
       (4) The United States has national interests in preserving ,Public
     its partnership with Iraq and other countries in the region ,Public
       (A) combating terrorists including the Islamic State of ,Public
       (B) preventing Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons ,Public
     countries throughout the Middle East who demand an end to ,Public
     government corruption and violations of basic human rights.,Public
       (5) Over the past eight months in response to rising ,Public
     tensions with Iran the United States has introduced over ,Public
       (6) When the United States uses military force the ,Public
     American people and members of the United States Armed Forces ,Public
     deserve a credible explanation regarding such use of military ,Public
       (7) The War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.) ,Public
     requires the President to consult with Congress ``in every ,Public
     possible instance'' before introducing United States Armed ,Public
       (8) Congress has not authorized the President to use ,Public
       (b) Termination.--Pursuant to section 5(c) of the War ,Public
     Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) Congress hereby ,Public
     directs the President to terminate the use of United States ,Public
     Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran or ,Public
       (1) Congress has declared war or enacted specific statutory ,Public
     authorization for such use of the Armed Forces; or,Public
     appropriate to defend against an imminent armed attack upon ,Public
     the United States its territories or possessions or its ,Public
     Armed Forces consistent with the requirements of the War ,Public
       (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be ,Public
       (1) to prevent the President from using military force ,Public
       (2) to limit the obligations of the executive branch set ,Public
     forth in the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.);,Public
       (3) to affect the provisions of an Act or joint resolution ,Public
     of Congress specifically authorizing the use of United States ,Public
     Armed Forces to engage in hostilities against Iran or any ,Public
     part of its government or military that is enacted after the ,Public
     date of the adoption of this concurrent resolution;,Public
       (4) to prevent the use of necessary and appropriate ,Public
     military force to defend United States allies and partners if ,Public
     authorized by Congress consistent with the requirements of ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The concurrent resolution as amended shall ,Public
be debatable for 2 hours equally divided and controlled by the chair ,Public
and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.,Public
  The gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) and the gentleman from Texas ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members ,Public
have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and ,Public
include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 83 currently under ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  We are here this afternoon so that this body can exercise one of its ,Public
important constitutional responsibilities deciding on whether or not ,Public
this country will wage war whether or not we will check an executive ,Public
that has brought our country to a dangerous brink.,Public
  In recent months tensions between the United States and Iran have ,Public
ticked up bit by bit until this last week when we found ourselves in ,Public
  Let's be clear: The Iranians are responsible for their own harmful ,Public
behavior. We know this is a regime that underwrites terrorism that ,Public
tries to strengthen its own position by fomenting instability and ,Public
provocation. We know that about Iran. No one expects Iran to be the ,Public
adult in the room when it comes to global affairs.,Public
  What we do expect is that American leadership and American policy ,Public
  So the world was stunned last week when the Trump administration ,Public
chose instead the path towards escalation with the killing of Qasem ,Public
  We need to be honest about Soleimani. He was a bad guy. He had ,Public
masterminded attacks and campaigns that cost thousands of innocent ,Public
lives. In the places where we have seen Iran's most harmful activity ,Public
Soleimani's fingerprints were everywhere. He had American blood on his ,Public
  But are we really safer today as the administration claims with ,Public
American citizens told to get out of Iraq as fast as they can; ,Public
thousands of troops deploying to the Middle East; an eviction notice ,Public
from the Iraqi Government whose partnership we depend on in the fight ,Public
against ISIS; Iranian missiles endangering American personnel?,Public
  It certainly doesn't feel like we are safer and a poll out today ,Public
  In foreign policy you have to weigh decisions like this. As awful as ,Public
Soleimani was this action has endangered American lives and American ,Public
  The President and his advisers say they had no choice; that there was ,Public
imminent threat. Then they said well he had done bad things in the ,Public
past and was going to do more bad things in the future. When they sent ,Public
a report on the strike to Congress the administration took the highly ,Public
  And then yesterday in a classified briefing when Members demanded ,Public
to see the evidence that justified the strike the message from the ,Public
administration essentially boiled down to this: Trust us. When we ,Public
asked What is the plan going forward? The administration essentially ,Public
  Trust us is not good enough Madam Speaker not for me and not for ,Public
  Madam Speaker if they are going to send our men and women in uniform ,Public
  First of all this administration hasn't given us any reason to ,Public
believe that this is a fact. The foreign policy of this administration ,Public
has undermined American leadership cut our diplomats off at the knees ,Public
alienated our allies and walked away from our obligations. We have ,Public
lurched from crisis to crisis each time hoping that the situation ,Public
  I call it fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants foreign policy and it is no ,Public
way to advance American interests and values on the global stage.,Public
  But beyond that beyond the way this administration has acted it is ,Public
not the job of Congress to give any administration its blind trust. It ,Public
is why we have separation of powers. It is why the Constitution ,Public
  Let me say that again. It is why the Constitution entrusts war powers ,Public
to Congress. We haven't had a declared war in this country since World ,Public
  So it is a relief that both the administration and the Iranians have ,Public
for the moment opted to de-escalate. But we would be foolish to think ,Public
this crisis is over. It could flame up again in the blink of an eye ,Public
and I worry that another misstep on either side could be what plunges ,Public
our country into another ill-advised war in the Middle East.,Public
  I will say it very plainly: The American people do not want war with ,Public
Iran. With the measure before us today we are denying the President ,Public
  This would direct the President to terminate the use of armed force ,Public
against Iran without congressional authorization unless it is necessary ,Public
to respond to an imminent armed attack against the United States.,Public
  The President always has the power to defend America. No one denies ,Public
that. This resolution explicitly preserves this right but that is a ,Public
limited exception. The President shouldn't abuse it.,Public
  Now we have heard the argument that the 2002 Authorization for the ,Public
Use of Military Force the Iraq war authorization would justify ,Public
military action against Iran. That is just wrong. It is not what ,Public
Congress intended when it passed that resolution. I was here. I ,Public
remember it. It should be repealed not used to launch more military ,Public
  If the President wants to use military force against Iran he has to ,Public
come to Congress. Any President has to come to Congress. We are not ,Public
making rules only for this President. We are making rules for the ,Public
President any President vis-a-vis Congress' constitutional powers.,Public
  The President has to make the case first first not after he ,Public
launches an ill-advised attack then after the fact comes up with a ,Public
reason why it was necessary and why it was legal. That is not the way ,Public
  Today I have heard the myth floating around that this resolution is ,Public
nonbinding; that it is just symbolic. So let me quote from the War ,Public
  The War Powers law says: ``At any time that United States Armed ,Public
Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United ,Public
States its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or ,Public
specific statutory authorization such forces shall be removed by the ,Public
President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.'' Again ,Public
by concurrent resolution. That is what the War Powers Act states that ,Public
  This is the House of Representatives exercising its Article I ,Public
authority. We don't get authority over war powers just because--if the ,Public
President says so. We get authority over war powers period. That is ,Public
  And one final point Madam Speaker about the tone of this debate. ,Public
Yesterday a Member of this body went on television and said that ,Public
Democrats ``are in love with terrorists. They mourn Soleimani more than ,Public
  Another Member labeled a group of colleagues ``Ayatollah ,Public
  At a time when we are talking about policy that will have direct ,Public
bearing on American men and women servicemembers and diplomats in ,Public
harm's way comments like that reflect very poorly on this body. And I ,Public
remind the House that all Members in both parties regardless of ,Public
party love this country. These words have no place in this debate.,Public
  On the Foreign Affairs Committee we take pride in debating issues ,Public
even the toughest issues on the merits and on the facts. I salute my ,Public
friend the ranking member Mr. McCaul for working so closely with me ,Public
to make sure we do so. That is one of the keys of the Foreign Affairs ,Public
  I strongly encourage all Members on both sides to bear that in mind ,Public
during this debate. We all take the same oath. We can argue about this ,Public
resolution without questioning one another's motives or one another's ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  When President Obama took down Osama Bin Laden the Rean ,Public
Members joined with Democrats as Americans to praise the President. ,Public
Unfortunately today Democrats are incapable of giving this President ,Public
credit where credit is due which only emboldens Iran.,Public
  I am surprised to be faced with this partisan resolution today. We ,Public
should be standing together as the chairman mentioned as a Nation. ,Public
Instead this resolution plays politics with national security.,Public
  Yesterday the President laid out a measured response to Iran's ,Public
ballistic missile attacks. Let me be clear. The President is not ,Public
seeking war with Iran. The President has shown if anything,Public
great restraint regarding Iran including after Iran's downing of a ,Public
  But in their blind contempt for the President my colleagues are ,Public
ignoring the assessments of career intelligence and military ,Public
  Our colleagues on the other side are downplaying the murderous evil ,Public
of Soleimani the mastermind of terror in the Middle East for over two ,Public
  Soleimani was designated as a terrorist by the Obama administration. ,Public
He was responsible for the deaths of more than 600 Americans and ,Public
  Soleimani was involved in the Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ,Public
Ambassador to the United States on American soil in Georgetown right ,Public
in this city. Soleimani oversaw Iran's support for Assad in Syria ,Public
including convincing Russia to fight for Assad killing hundreds of ,Public
thousands. This year Soleimani played a key role in the crackdown on ,Public
protestors in Iraq that killed hundreds of Iraqis.,Public
  It should be clear to any reasonable person that Soleimani posed a ,Public
long-term threat to the United States and to innocent civilians in the ,Public
Middle East and across the globe. We don't need to get into classified ,Public
  According to the Department of Defense in the last 2 months ,Public
Soleimani and his proxies launched 12 attacks against U.S. forces and ,Public
facilities in Iraq. On December 27 Soleimani's Iranian proxies killed ,Public
an American and injured four U.S. servicemembers near Kirkuk. On ,Public
Dec-31 Soleimani's Iranian proxies launched an assault on the ,Public
  But Soleimani was not done. Secretary Pompeo said that Soleimani was ,Public
``actively plotting'' to take ``big action'' that would ``put dozens if ,Public
not hundreds of American lives at risk'' which DOD said targeted ,Public
American diplomats and servicemembers in Iraq and throughout the ,Public
  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Milley said that the ,Public
administration would have been ``culpably negligent'' given the ,Public
evidence and intelligence they had had they not acted.,Public
  The President possessed the legal authority for this strike and ,Public
complied with his obligation to report it to Congress within 48 hours ,Public
under the War Powers Resolution. The President has inherent Article II ,Public
authority as Commander in Chief to defend United States personnel from ,Public
attacks that Soleimani was carrying out and plotting against Americans. ,Public
  This is not just a partisan analysis. Jeh Johnson President Obama's ,Public
general counsel at the Department of Defense and former Secretary of ,Public
Homeland Security approved the airstrikes during the Obama ,Public
administration. He stated that Soleimani ``was a lawful military ,Public
objective and the President under his constitutional authority as ,Public
Commander in Chief had ample domestic legal authority to take him out ,Public
without an additional congressional authorization.'' That was President ,Public
  As a second authority the National Security Adviser cited the 2002 ,Public
AUMF that authorized the use of force ``to defend the national security ,Public
of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.'' ,Public
That authorization has been used previously to address terrorist ,Public
threats to U.S. personnel inside Iraq including by President Obama to ,Public
  The dangerously partisan reactions to last week's strike in defense ,Public
of Americans are even more apparent when compared to Democratic ,Public
reactions to Obama's thousands of unauthorized airstrikes in defense of ,Public
  Back in June 2011 then-Leader Pelosi was asked about the Obama ,Public
administration's months of airstrikes inside Libya dropping hundreds ,Public
of millions of dollars in U.S. munitions without congressional ,Public
authorization. Leader Pelosi was asked: ``Madam Leader you are saying ,Public
that the President did not need authorization initially and still does ,Public
not need any authorization from Congress on Libya?'' Her answer was ,Public
  She said: ``I believe the limited nature of this engagement allows ,Public
the President to go forward. . . . I am satisfied that the President ,Public
  That logic should apply far more in the strike against Soleimani to ,Public
  I am pleased the administration did not hesitate to take bold action ,Public
given the high threat level. Soleimani showed us through the embassy ,Public
attack and the attacks on U.S. forces that he was serious about hurting ,Public
  Our intelligence community saw his next plan coming together and our ,Public
military under direction from our Commander in Chief acted. They saw ,Public
  I thank the President and the men and women of our intelligence ,Public
community and the military for upholding their responsibility to ,Public
protect American lives. Instead of supporting the President ,Public
unfortunately my Democratic colleagues are dividing Americans at a ,Public
critical time weakening our leverage overseas and emboldening our ,Public
enemy the largest state sponsor of terror in the world.,Public
  I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution which seeks to tie the ,Public
President's hands as he continues to defend Americans in the Middle ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from ,Public
Michigan (Ms. Slotkin) the author of this important resolution.,Public
  Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker I rise today in support of my bill a War ,Public
Powers Resolution that states that the President of the United States ,Public
must consult Congress before going to war with Iran. This is simply ,Public
  For me this is not a theoretical exercise. My husband spent 30 years ,Public
in the Army and retired as a colonel. We actually met on my third tour ,Public
in Iraq when I was a CIA officer. My stepdaughter is a brand-new Army ,Public
officer. My son-in-law's unit is stationed at Al Asad Air Base which ,Public
was just targeted by ballistic missiles this week.,Public
  If our loved ones are going to be sent to fight in any protracted ,Public
war the President owes the American  a conversation. The ,Public
resolution we will be voting on today allows us to start that debate ,Public
  Let me be clear: The Government of Iran is a leading state sponsor of ,Public
terrorism and engages in a range of destabilizing activities across the ,Public
Middle East. I have experienced these personally as a former CIA ,Public
analyst. I served multiple tours in Iraq three tours. My specialty is ,Public
  I have followed Iran's destabilizing activity in Iraq up close for my ,Public
entire professional career. I have watched friends and colleagues hurt ,Public
or killed by Iranian rockets mortars and explosive devices. Iranian ,Public
General Qasem Soleimani was the lead architect of much of Iran's ,Public
destabilizing activities in the Middle East and throughout the world.,Public
  To that end with Iran or with any other adversary the United States ,Public
always has the inherent right and obligation to self-defense against ,Public
imminent armed attacks--always. The United States always maintains the ,Public
right and the responsibility to ensure the safety of our diplomatic ,Public
  When it comes to the matter of longer term war either as something ,Public
that we choose as a Nation or as something that we find ourselves in ,Public
as Members of this body we have a constitutional responsibility to ,Public
  The Framers of our Constitution rightly believed that the power to ,Public
declare war belongs in the Congress because this would ensure that the ,Public
American people through the legislators they elected weigh the most ,Public
  To this end the resolution does a few simple things.,Public
  First it states that the President does not currently have ,Public
authorization for war against Iran which his own Secretary of Defense ,Public
acknowledged in a congressional hearing last month.,Public
  Second it requires the President to get congressional authorization ,Public
if he wants to conduct a protracted war with Iran.,Public
  Third it makes clear that the President maintains the authority to ,Public
use force to prevent imminent attacks against the United States or our ,Public
in national security it is extremely important to me that this ,Public
resolution in no way ties the President's hands or takes away any ,Public
capabilities from our military commanders to respond in self-defense ,Public
  We have been at war for nearly two decades which has spanned both ,Public
Rean and Democratic administrations as my colleague pointed out. ,Public
In that time Congress has voted only twice to authorize the use of ,Public
  Congress has long abdicated its responsibility as laid out in the ,Public
Constitution to make the hard decisions we owe our troops when it comes ,Public
to authorizing war. We owe it to our military and to ourselves as a ,Public
Nation to open this conversation on the authorization of military ,Public
force to provide our troops that clarity and to abide by the ,Public
  I urge my colleagues Reans and Democrats to support this ,Public
resolution. I know it is a political time but my attempt was to hew ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ,Public
California (Mr. McCarthy) the distinguished Rean leader.,Public
  Mr. McCARTHY. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding.,Public
  The United States and our allies are safer with Qasem Soleimani gone. ,Public
President Trump's decisive leadership was justified and it was right.,Public
  Soleimani had the blood of over 600 American servicemembers on his ,Public
hands. For more than 20 years he attacked our troops established a ,Public
brutal reign of terror across the Middle East and was directly ,Public
responsible for the death of thousands of innocent civilians including ,Public
in his own country. And he had more terror planned.,Public
  As President Trump said this strike was done to prevent a war not ,Public
start one. In yesterday's address he was true to his word. He was ,Public
confident and restrained. Even as he underscored our strength and ,Public
resolve he extended the people of Iran our hand in peace and ,Public
friendship. President Trump's decision to embrace the Reagan doctrine ,Public
of peace through strength in dealing with Iran has worked.,Public
  Those who criticize President Trump for Iran's dangerous foreign ,Public
policy should actually spend a few moments to review their history. It ,Public
is Iran that is responsible for escalating tensions by creating chaos ,Public
  In the decades since 1979's revolution Iran has become the number ,Public
one state sponsor of terrorism in the world. More recently it shot ,Public
down an American military drone and seized a British oil tanker.,Public
  On December 27 Iranian proxies crossed the line by killing an ,Public
American. For the first time since 1988 we have an administration ,Public
willing to strike back. From most of the media reports many may know ,Public
him only as an unnamed U.S. contractor killed in Iraq but he was more ,Public
than that. His name was Nawres Hamid. He was a husband. He was the ,Public
father of two young sons. He was a resident of California.,Public
  Before Nawres became a citizen he was valiantly serving alongside ,Public
our troops as a linguist. All of our hearts break for his wife and ,Public
  There are some in this Chamber who seem to be downplaying his death ,Public
but his death matters. It matters to his family. It matters to his ,Public
countrymen. It matters to the President. It matters to me. His death ,Public
was unnecessary unprovoked and it deserved justice.,Public
  That is why my next statement carries even more meaning. Red lines ,Public
should mean something. In this administration they do. Killing Nawres ,Public
was a red line. Planning to kill Americans is a red line.,Public
  I am confident that the right decision was to take out the man ,Public
responsible for Nawres' death and the death of hundreds of other ,Public
  Iran responded earlier this week by sending missiles to U.S. bases in ,Public
Iraq. I believe we are all relieved and grateful that there were no ,Public
American casualties. Iran appears to be pulling back from its strategy ,Public
of provocation in the face of firm American determination. Iran seems ,Public
to understand that deescalation is right for them and the world.,Public
  Now is the time for our country to come together and speak with one ,Public
voice not as Reans not as Democrats but as Americans.,Public
  Instead of working with this administration to continue to work ,Public
toward shared goals Democrats are using this moment to continue their ,Public
  As my colleague and former CIA officer Will Hurd said he never ,Public
thought he would see the day that the Iranian Government would be able ,Public
to manipulate Members of Congress Democratic Presidential candidates ,Public
and the Western media yet here we are on this floor today.,Public
  If President Trump's instinct is to put America first his critics' ,Public
  The words of my Democratic colleagues including the Speaker of the ,Public
House blame the United States for attacks Iran has been initiating for ,Public
the past four decades. Now they want to limit the President's ability ,Public
  I want to clear up some news Madam Speaker that I actually even ,Public
recently heard on this floor. I would probably consider it fake news ,Public
  Contrary to their claim the resolution before the House today is ,Public
nonbinding. It is called a concurrent resolution. This resolution if ,Public
passed won't go to the President's desk for signature. It won't have ,Public
  Madam Speaker I heard the chairman try to claim that this had power. ,Public
I know we have three coequal branches of government.,Public
  Madam Speaker I think the chairman should actually look at what the ,Public
Supreme Court ruled in the Chadha case that concurrent resolutions are ,Public
unconstitutional as a means to limit the executive branch. I think I ,Public
  In fact the Supreme Court ruled in the Chadha case that concurrent ,Public
resolutions are unconstitutional as a means to limit the executive ,Public
branch. The purpose of a concurrent resolution is to deal with mundane ,Public
  Now I want everybody to know and understand what we have used ,Public
concurrent resolutions for--it is very important: to authorize the use ,Public
of the Capitol Grounds for the Soap Box Derby to use the rotunda to ,Public
present a congressional medal to Jack Nicklaus and to host a birthday ,Public
party in the Capitol Visitor Center. But the new majority decided to ,Public
  For a party that wants to claim they care about the Constitution ,Public
Madam Speaker Democrats may want to brush up on their facts. If they ,Public
did they would realize their actions today are shameful and ,Public
embarrassing even by the low standards they set in their impeachment ,Public
  They seem to have forgotten that we are not the House of Resolutions. ,Public
We are actually the U.S. House of Representatives. Our job isn't to ,Public
debate feelings. Our job isn't to make recommendations. We are ,Public
  But that is not how we are spending our time today. This resolution ,Public
has as much force of law as a new year's resolution. It is nothing more ,Public
than a press release to appease their socialist base.,Public
  What message is it sending to Iran? That we are strong determined ,Public
and united as a country or that we are divided shortsighted and ,Public
  Madam Speaker ``In war resolution'' and ``in peace goodwill.'' ,Public
Winston Churchill wrote those words after he led Britain to victory in ,Public
the Second World War. They describe what he believed were the right ,Public
actions for great leaders to take at history's defining moment.,Public
  We should keep Churchill's words in mind today. President Trump ,Public
clearly has. Because of President Trump's leadership the United States ,Public
and our allies are safer today than we were exactly 1 week ago.,Public
  Petty politics are wrong for the country especially now. Not liking ,Public
President Trump is not an excuse for failing to see that the President ,Public
and his administration have a sensible and deeply American strategy for ,Public
  Madam Speaker I imagine we will continue to hear from other ,Public
Democrats defending Iran for their escalation and the death of an ,Public
American. Madam Speaker I imagine that the Democrats will try to claim ,Public
a concurrent resolution is more than a Soap Box Derby but the Supreme ,Public
  Madam Speaker I imagine I will hear a lot from the Democrats today. ,Public
I would like to hear a Democrat speak to the 600 Gold Star families ,Public
whose loved ones were killed by Soleimani. I would like to hear them ,Public
  I would like to hear them defend Iran and their actions of burning an ,Public
embassy of killing an American of killing thousands of civilians even ,Public
in their own country. But they are going to take our time today with ,Public
  Yes they will run to the mikes. They will get on TV. They will tell ,Public
a little more fake news that it meant something today.,Public
  The only thing that will happen today is it will make Iran believe ,Public
they are stronger. It will make Iran believe they have allies in the ,Public
  Madam Speaker in light of the information that we have coming out of ,Public
Iran if it is true of why an airliner was shot down if that was the ,Public
case I would like to see a Democrat move to the floor and pull this ,Public
concurrent resolution. If it means nothing else I think we should have ,Public
  I look forward to listening Madam Speaker to any Democrat who wants ,Public
to speak to the Gold Star families about why they want to have a debate ,Public
today and tell them that ``Soleimani is bad but.'' It is not ``but''; ,Public
it is ``because'' because he killed Americans because he killed ,Public
thousands of civilians. That is why he was taken out and the world is ,Public
  Madam Speaker I look forward to hearing the defense from the other ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I am sorry that the Rean leader is ,Public
casting aspersions. I think everyone on both sides of the aisle takes ,Public
this seriously and has reasons for what we are voting on.,Public
  Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from ,Public
California (Mr. Khanna) a gentleman who has been very involved in ,Public
these issues for a long long time and has been a real leader in these ,Public
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker I thank Chairman Engel for yielding and ,Public
  I rise today not as a partisan but as someone concerned about ,Public
  We have worked across the aisle with people like Representative ,Public
Meadows and others to stop our country from getting into endless wars. ,Public
There is not one party that wants to stop these wars; this is in our ,Public
  Now let's be very clear. Soleimani had blood on his hands. Soleimani ,Public
was a bad actor. Soleimani killed Americans. That is not the debate.,Public
  The debate is whether America should get into another war in the ,Public
Middle East or whether we should be focused on our real competition ,Public
  We are 21 percent of the world's GDP. China our competition for the ,Public
21st century is 15 percent. Iran is 0.44 percent of GDP.,Public
  China hasn't been in a war since 1979. We are in 40 conflicts.,Public
  Future historians will ask why we were so obsessed with a region the ,Public
Middle East with 3.5 percent of GDP when we should have been focused ,Public
on investing in our country to build the future to win the 21st ,Public
  I don't think staying out of bad wars that cost this country ,Public
trillions of dollars is a Democratic issue or a Rean issue. ,Public
  I know Leader McCarthy says this is a formality. Under the War Powers ,Public
Act you are supposed to have a concurrent resolution.,Public
  My hope is the President will agree with this and not get us into a ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 15 seconds to the ,Public
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker I appreciate the gentleman yielding.,Public
  I will make my final point. This shouldn't be partisan.,Public
  Here is what I would love to see that the President says in the ,Public
future action he is not going to get into a war and that he agrees ,Public
with the concurrent resolution that this body passes.,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker I rise today in opposition to this ,Public
resolution which curtails the President's authority to protect ,Public
  Two weeks ago Iranian proxies launched a missile attack on American ,Public
forces in Iraq. This was the 11th such rocket attack by the Iranians in ,Public
recent months. This time as our leader said it killed Nawres Hamid ,Public
who was a husband a father a contractor and an American citizen.,Public
  The man behind this attack and additional attacks that were being ,Public
planned and that were imminent was the terrorist mastermind Qasem ,Public
Soleimani who was responsible for the deaths as we have heard of at ,Public
least 600 probably many more Americans and for thousands of others in ,Public
that part of the world and for causing destabilization throughout the ,Public
  For years now Soleimani had been leading Iran's shadow war against ,Public
us and against our allies. In targeting Soleimani President Trump took ,Public
bold long-overdue action and he ought to be supported for this ,Public
  This resolution by condemning even limited military force and ,Public
limited action would essentially tie the President's hands behind his ,Public
back as he tries to counter Iran's shadow campaign against us.,Public
  Madam Speaker it makes no sense this resolution and I strongly ,Public
urge my colleagues to oppose it and vote against it.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from ,Public
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker America is not safe or safer because ,Public
of the acts that occurred local time on January 32020,Public
  America is in more jeopardy as are our brave men and women in the ,Public
United States military whom we hold in the highest esteem and say to ,Public
their families: We are obligated and committed to honoring and thanking ,Public
you but to also recognizing when we send you into battle there would ,Public
and should be the consultation the engagement the understanding of ,Public
the intelligence and the work between Article I the United States ,Public
Congress and Article II the President of the United States.,Public
  I will not allow any Member of Congress to malign my Gold Star ,Public
families or to suggest that any Member here does not respect the ,Public
ultimate sacrifice that their family members took. Family members who ,Public
are Gold Star should not be used in a political debate. They should ,Public
  And I will not accept anyone describing Democrats as mourning ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 15 seconds to the ,Public
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker what I will say is that nothing in ,Public
this resolution speaks to any named person. It says that this body ,Public
this Congress must adhere to its duty to be able to ensure that the ,Public
President of the United States does not unilaterally take us into war ,Public
  It does as well say that my resolution in 2002 indicated that we ,Public
  Madam Speaker as a senior member of the House Committees on the ,Public
Judiciary and on Homeland Security as a member serving in this body on ,Public
Sep-11 2001 and throughout the fateful and tragic war in Iraq ,Public
and as an original cosponsor I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. ,Public
83 a concurrent resolution directing the President to terminate the ,Public
engagement of United States Armed Forces in hostilities in or against ,Public
  l thank the gentlelady from Michigan Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin ,Public
for introducing this resolution and Foreign Affairs Committee Chair ,Public
Eliot Engel for his work on this important resolution.,Public
  I also thank Speaker Pelosi for taking swift action to afford the ,Public
House the opportunity to honor its constitutional duty to keep the ,Public
American people safe by limiting the President from taking further ,Public
  We know from bitter and heart-breaking experience the truth that ,Public
while dangerous and bloody battles are fought by the military it is ,Public
  And that is why the Framers lodged the awesome power to declare and ,Public
take the nation to war not in the hands of a single individual but ,Public
in the collective judgment of Congress the representatives of the ,Public
  It is true of course that the United States has an inherent right to ,Public
self-defense against imminent armed attacks and that it maintains the ,Public
right to ensure the safety of diplomatic personnel serving abroad.,Public
  But in matters of imminent armed attacks the executive branch must ,Public
inform Congress as to why military action was necessary within a ,Public
certain window of opportunity the possible harm that missing the ,Public
window would cause and why the action was likely to prevent future ,Public
  Only after being fully briefed and informed is the Congress in a ,Public
position to validate and ratify or disapprove and terminate the action.,Public
  Madam Speaker Section 5(c) of the 1973 War Power Resolution Pub. L. ,Public
93-148 provides that whenever ``United States Armed Forces are engaged ,Public
in hostilities outside the territory of the United States its ,Public
possessions and territories without a declaration of war or specific ,Public
statutory authorization such forces shall be removed by the President ,Public
if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.'',Public
  The military action ordered on Friday January 32020 local time by ,Public
the President to kill Major General Qasem Soleimani the head of Iran's ,Public
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps may have rid the world of a major ,Public
architect of terror but leaves unanswered the critically important ,Public
question of why the action was taken at that time.,Public
  Even at this late hour members of Congress have not been briefed or ,Public
been shown compelling evidence by the Administration that the action ,Public
was necessary to repel a credible certain and imminent attack on the ,Public
United States its allies or American civilians or military personnel.,Public
  The Administration has yet to provide proof or assuage the concerns ,Public
of most member of Congress and of the American people that the ,Public
killing of Major General Soleimani was a necessary action that was the ,Public
product of a carefully crafted geopolitical strategy developed after ,Public
extensive discussion within the national security apparatus regarding ,Public
the short and long-term consequences for the security of the region and ,Public
  Similarly we do not know whether the decision to engage in the ,Public
hostile action against Iran was made by the President in consultation ,Public
and agreement with our regional and international allies and whether ,Public
there is now in place a strategy to ensure that the action taken does ,Public
not lead to a greater escalation of tensions between Iran and the ,Public
United States or in the worst case another war in the Middle East ,Public
placing at risk the lives and safety of millions of persons.,Public
  Madam Speaker Major General Soleimani was the long-time chief of the ,Public
Quds Force the elite special forces battalion of the Islamic ,Public
Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) assisted Syrian strongman Bashar al ,Public
Assad slaughter hundreds of thousands of his own people in the Syrian ,Public
civil war helped incite the Houthis in Yemen's civil war and oversaw ,Public
the brutal killing of hundreds of Iraqi protesters recently ,Public
demonstrating against Iranian influence in their country.,Public
  Iran's Quds Force under Soleimani's leadership has long been ,Public
suspected by the U.S. Government of involvement in a 2011 plot to ,Public
assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States and bore ,Public
responsibility for the deaths of more than 600 Americans killed by ,Public
Iranian proxies since the 2003 inception of the war in Iraq.,Public
  Over the past eight months in response to rising tensions with Iran ,Public
the United States has introduced over 15000 additional forces into the ,Public
  But Major General Soleimani was more than a military leader he was a ,Public
high-ranking political leader second only in power and influence to ,Public
  In fact Soleimani was regarded by many as a future president of ,Public
  It was foreseeable therefore that the killing of Soleimani by ,Public
American forces was likely to invite retaliation by Iran putting at ,Public
risk American military and civilian personnel as well as its allies in ,Public
  It must be remembered that the United States has national interests ,Public
in preserving its partnership with Iraq and other countries in the ,Public
region including by combating terrorists including the Islamic State ,Public
of Iraq and Syria (ISIS); preventing Iran from achieving a nuclear ,Public
weapons capability; and supporting the people of Iraq Iran and other ,Public
countries throughout the Middle East who demand an end to government ,Public
  For these reasons it is essential that the Administration have in ,Public
place a sound well-considered and meticulously developed strategy for ,Public
  There is no evidence that the Administration consulted with Congress ,Public
or the Gang of 8 no evidence that it enlisted or even consulted our ,Public
allies in NATO or the region no evidence that the Administration has a ,Public
working and well-functioning national security council apparatus.,Public
  This is a critical Pottery Barn failure in dealing with the Middle ,Public
East for as former Secretary of State Colin Powell stated before the ,Public
  Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has vowed that a ``harsh ,Public
retaliation is waiting'' for the United States as a consequence of the ,Public
  It is imperative that the Administration have in place a strategy to ,Public
counter and deescalate any Iranian response and have in place measure ,Public
to protect the safety of Americans residing or travelling abroad and to ,Public
  The deliberate and targeted killing of Major General Soleimani has ,Public
the potential to be the most consequential assassination of a political ,Public
leader since World War I was started by the assassination of Archduke ,Public
Franz Ferdinand Carl Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria the heir ,Public
presumptive of the throne of Austria-Hungary in 1914.,Public
  One of the enduring lessons of the Great War too often forgotten but ,Public
so well documented in Barbara Tuchman's prize-winning history ``The ,Public
Guns of August'' is that misconceptions miscalculations and mistakes ,Public
result in the tragedy of horrific warfare; among them are ,Public
overestimating the value of one's economic power harboring an ill-,Public
founded belief in quick victory and a failure to consider political ,Public
  Madam Speaker the decision to send American men and women into ,Public
harm's way is the most consequential decision the Constitution vests in ,Public
  Members of Congress must be apprised of all facts material to the ,Public
decision and have access to relevant documentation classified and ,Public
otherwise and afforded the opportunity to meet in small groups and in ,Public
secure locations with senior members of the Administration's national ,Public
security team who can answer detailed and pointed questions and provide ,Public
  The Constitution wisely divides the responsibility of deciding when ,Public
to use military force to protect the Nation and its interests between ,Public
the President and the Congress the representatives of the American ,Public
  The United States' military involvement in Iraq begun in March 2003 ,Public
and continuing to this day has taught this Nation the importance of ,Public
having accurate and reliable information when deciding whether to use ,Public
military force and the painful costs in lives and treasure of acting ,Public
  That is why I am proud to support and cosponsor H. Con. Res. 83 the ,Public
concurrent resolution before us which directs the President to ,Public
terminate immediately the use of United States Armed Forces to engage ,Public
in hostilities in or against Iran or any part of its government or ,Public
military unless Congress has declared war or enacted specific ,Public
statutory authorization for such use of the Armed Forces; or the use of ,Public
the Armed Forces is necessary and appropriate to defend against an ,Public
imminent armed attack upon the United States its territories or ,Public
possessions or its Armed Forces consistent with the requirements of ,Public
  Our constituents all Americans across the country and the people of ,Public
the globe are looking to us to ensure that tensions between the United ,Public
States and Iran are deescalated that smart power and diplomacy be ,Public
employed and every effort be made to ensure the peace and safety in ,Public
America and the region and the lives of the innocent not be placed at ,Public
  Madam Speaker today our Nation is debating the very profound ,Public
question of war and peace and the structure and nature of international ,Public
relations in the 21st century. Before us today is the serious and ,Public
fundamental question of life and death: whether or not this Congress ,Public
will give the President authority to commit this Nation to war.,Public
  Always a question of the greatest importance our decision today is ,Public
further weighted by the fact that we are being asked to sanction a new ,Public
foreign policy doctrine that gives the President the power to launch a ,Public
unilateral and preemptive first strike against Iraq before we have ,Public
  My amendment provides an option and the time to pursue it. Its goal ,Public
is to give the United Nations inspections process a chance to work. It ,Public
provides an option short of war with the objective of protecting the ,Public
American people and the world from any threat posed by Iraqi weapons of ,Public
  The amendment urges the United States to reengage the diplomatic ,Public
process and it stresses our government's commitment to eliminating any ,Public
Iraqi weapons of mass destruction through United Nations inspections ,Public
  It emphasizes the potentially dangerous and disastrous long-term ,Public
consequences for the United States of codifying the President's ,Public
  The administration's resolution forecloses alternatives to war before ,Public
  We do not need to rush to war and we should not rush to war. If what ,Public
we are worried about is the defense of the United States and its ,Public
  If the United States truly faced an imminent attack from anywhere ,Public
the President has all of the authority in the world to ensure our ,Public
defense based on the Constitution the War Powers Act and the United ,Public
  Our own intelligence agencies report that there is currently little ,Public
chance of chemical and biological attack from Saddam Hussein on U.S. ,Public
forces or territories. But they emphasize that an attack could become ,Public
much more likely if Iraq believes that it is about to be attacked. This ,Public
is a frightening and dangerous potential consequence that requires ,Public
  President Bush's doctrine of preemption violates international law ,Public
the United Nations Charter and our own long-term security interests. It ,Public
will set a precedent that could come back to haunt us.,Public
  Do we want to see our claim to preemption echoed by other countries ,Public
maintaining that they perceive similar threats? India or Pakistan? ,Public
  I would submit that we would have little moral authority to urge ,Public
other countries to resist launching preemptive strikes themselves. This ,Public
approach threatens to destabilize the Middle East unleash new forces ,Public
of terrorism and instability and completely derail any prospects for ,Public
  Unilateralism is not the answer. Iraqi weapons of mass destruction ,Public
are a problem to the world community and we must confront it and we ,Public
should do so through the United Nations. Multilateralism and steadfast ,Public
commitment to international law should be the guiding principle as we ,Public
  As I said the purpose of my amendment is to let the United Nations ,Public
do its work. Let us give inspections and other containment mechanisms a ,Public
chance to succeed once again. Inspections did make real progress in ,Public
eliminating weapons of mass destruction in the 1990s despite Saddam ,Public
Hussein's best effort at obstruction and deceit. U.N. inspectors ,Public
destroyed large stockpiles of chemical weapons missiles and weapons of ,Public
mass destruction. We can and should renew and expand this process. In ,Public
addition to inspections we should improve border monitoring through an ,Public
enhanced containment system to prevent shipments of nuclear materials ,Public
or other weapons to Iraq. And we should install surveillance technology ,Public
  As part of enhanced containment we should work with the countries ,Public
bordering Iraq and with regional seaports to ensure that United Nations ,Public
Security Council resolutions are enforced and we should plug holes in ,Public
the current arms embargo blanket. We should also work on ,Public
nonproliferation efforts globally to secure weapons materials.,Public
  All of these are diplomatic options that we can and should undertake ,Public
  What we are doing today is building the framework for 21st century ,Public
international relations. It will either be a framework of unilateralism ,Public
and insecurity or multilateral cooperation and security. It is our ,Public
  During the Cold War the words ``first strike'' filled us with fear. ,Public
  I am really appalled that a democracy our democracy is ,Public
contemplating taking such a fearsome step and really setting such a ,Public
terrible international precedent that could be devastating for global ,Public
  We are contemplating sending our young men and women to war where ,Public
they will be doing the killing and the dying. And we as ,Public
representatives of the American people have no idea where this action ,Public
will take us where it will end and what price we will pay in terms of ,Public
lives and resources. This too should cause us to pause. We have ,Public
choices however and we have an obligation to pursue them to give ,Public
U.N. inspections and enhanced containment a chance to work. What this ,Public
resolution does state very clearly and firmly is that the United States ,Public
will work to disarm Iraq through United Nations inspections and other ,Public
diplomatic tools. It states that we reject the doctrine of preemption ,Public
and it reaffirms our commitment to our own security and national ,Public
interests through multilateral diplomacy not unilateral attack.,Public
  I urge you to protect our national interests by giving the United ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker this week universally ,Public
respected Senator Joe Lieberman a Democrat provided an extraordinary ,Public
op-ed in The Wall Street Journal: ``President Trump's order to take out ,Public
Qasem Soleimani was morally constitutionally and strategically ,Public
correct. . . . No American can dispute that Soleimani created ,Public
supported and directed a network of terrorist organizations that ,Public
spread havoc in the Middle East.'' In Syria ``more than 5000,Public
  ``During the Iraq war Soleimani oversaw three camps in Iran.'' These ,Public
trained fighters have killed more than 600 American soldiers.,Public
  The claim that President Trump ``had no authority to order this ,Public
attack without congressional approval is constitutionally untenable and ,Public
practically senseless. . . . Democrats should leave partisan politics ,Public
at `the water's edge' and . . . stand together against Iran and ,Public
  Senator Joe Lieberman tells the truth. We must resist: ``Death to ,Public
  I extend our sympathies to the family of Nawres Hamid an Iraqi ,Public
American Muslim from California who was murdered by Soleimani-financed ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ,Public
Virginia (Mr. Connolly) a valuable member of the Foreign Affairs ,Public
  Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 83 ,Public
directing the President to cease military hostilities against Iran.,Public
  Last week President Trump ordered a provocative and disproportionate ,Public
drone strike killing Quds Force commander Major General Qasem ,Public
  Soleimani was a malign actor who masterminded the killings of many ,Public
U.S. soldiers but assassinating him has unleashed the dogs of war. ,Public
Iran launched a dozen ballistic missiles against two U.S. military ,Public
bases in Iraq and we must be prepared for further Iranian retaliation.,Public
  These threats stem from the President's fateful and reckless decision ,Public
to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal a deal that was working by ,Public
every measure leaving us with no leverage and Iran with nothing to ,Public
  We don't need another war. Peace demands action now. That is why ,Public
Congress must reassert its solemn constitutional duty under Article I ,Public
to decide when and where the United States goes to war. This resolution ,Public
  Madam Speaker on Tuesday night Iran launched at least a dozen ,Public
ballistic missiles against two U.S. military bases in Iraq.,Public
  Thankfully there were no American casualties but I remain concerned ,Public
  These attacks come after President Trump ordered a drone strike that ,Public
assassinated Iranian Quds Force commander Major General Qasem ,Public
  Soleimani was a bad actor and masterminded the killings of many U.S. ,Public
soldiers in Iraq and Lebanon. He will not be missed.,Public
  But killing Soleimani was supposed to make us safer. In reality the ,Public
  What is unfolding now is the result of the Trump Administration's ,Public
incoherent foreign policy stemming from its fateful and reckless ,Public
decision to withdraw the United States from our own agreement the Iran ,Public
  By all accounts prior to our withdrawal Iran was in compliance with ,Public
  It was only after our withdrawal and re-imposition of sanctions ,Public
lifted under the agreement that Iran began to exceed its stockpile of ,Public
low-enriched uranium and then resume uranium enrichment.,Public
  Following the Soleimani strike Iran has vowed to ignore all ,Public
restrictions set by the nuclear deal. This move has set in motion the ,Public
very thing we were seeking to avoid--a nuclear-armed Iran.,Public
  Our abrogation of the Iran nuclear agreement leaves us with no ,Public
  Iran and its proxy forces have engaged in a series of retaliatory ,Public
actions: attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf downing an ,Public
American drone in international waters cruise missile attacks against ,Public
Saudi oil plants and rocket attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq.,Public
  Secretary of State Pompeo claimed ``The world is a much safer place ,Public
and I can assure you Americans in the region are much safer after the ,Public
  And yet in the wake of Soleimani's killing the State Department has ,Public
urged Americans to leave Iraq immediately whether by air or by land ,Public
  Two years ago I warned that we were sleepwalking into an armed ,Public
conflict. That the hidden scandal of the Iraq War--the manipulation of ,Public
outcome--was now an overt political strategy to undermine the Iran ,Public
  I fear now that these steps have brought us to the brink of war with ,Public
  According to Pompeo ``this was an intelligence-based assessment that ,Public
  Yet when asked about the imminent threat facing Americans from ,Public
Soleimani Pompeo pointed to a previous attack in Iraq that killed an ,Public
American contractor and injured four servicemembers not a new ,Public
  Yesterday the Trump Administration offered a sophomoric and utterly ,Public
unconvincing briefing to members of Congress on the strike's rationale.,Public
  President Trump's decision to assassinate Soleimani was provocative ,Public
and disproportionate and has endangered American lives and the security ,Public
  We don't need another war. Peace demands action now.,Public
  That is why Congress must reassert its constitutional authority to ,Public
decide when and where the United States goes to war.,Public
  Article I Section 8 of the United States Constitution states that ,Public
``Congress shall have power . . . to declare war . . . and to raise and ,Public
  And today the House of Representatives will make clear that Congress ,Public
has not authorized President Trump to go to war with Iran.,Public
  Neither the 2001 nor the 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military ,Public
Force (AUMF) authorize the President to attack Iran or its senior ,Public
  I urge my colleagues in both the House and the Senate to support this ,Public
war powers resolution and reclaim our solemn constitutional duty to ,Public
determine when the United States puts our uniformed men and women in ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
  Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman from Texas.,Public
  This resolution is insincere and unserious. If my colleagues on the ,Public
other side really want to limit the President's ability to defend the ,Public
United States then they ought to take the vote and limit him and stand ,Public
  Now if you are not familiar with terrorist Soleimani let me just ,Public
  His reign of terror for Americans started with 241 marines in Beirut ,Public
Lebanon. He and his organization continued on to the Khobar Towers ,Public
hundreds and hundreds of Americans dead by IEDs and thousands maimed. A ,Public
servicemember from Pennsylvania incinerated--incinerated--in the ,Public
  The President does not desire war with Iran or anyone else but Iran ,Public
  I have got a news flash for everybody: They have been at war with the ,Public
United States since they punched us in the face in 1979.,Public
  Washington has been appeasing Iran and the policy of appeasement has ,Public
542 that is the number of drone attacks under the Obama ,Public
administration in places like Yemen Somalia Pakistan.,Public
  Oh by the way not the theatre of war for the United States. Not a ,Public
peep Madam Speaker not a peep from the other side.,Public
  The terrorist state of Iran cannot continue killing Americans and ,Public
cannot have a nuclear bomb. Madam Speaker it is time to stand up for ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ,Public
California (Mr. Sherman) a longtime valued member of the House Foreign ,Public
  Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker this resolution imposes extraordinary ,Public
restrictions on this President an extraordinary President who needs ,Public
  This is best exemplified by the President's gratuitous comment that ,Public
he would hit cultural sites in Iran. Not only is that a war crime but ,Public
it is a mistake because it drives the Iranian people toward the regime ,Public
while alienating our European allies whose support for our sanctions is ,Public
  The minority leader came to this floor and said Democrats were dupes ,Public
of the Islamic Re. I will compare my record of efforts against ,Public
the Islamic Re of Iran with those of any other Member.,Public
  You could argue whether Soleimani's death makes us safer or not over ,Public
the next few months. We have removed a terrorist mastermind from the ,Public
battlefield but we have inspired the other terrorists.,Public
  The real issue is the effect on Iran's program. That program is more ,Public
robust today than it was a week ago as Iran has employed more ,Public
centrifuges and is building a larger stockpile all without our ,Public
European friends who are still in the JCPOA taking any action against ,Public
  There was no policy process on the golf course where the President ,Public
made this decision. He heard not from a single expert on Iranian ,Public
  Our maximum pressure campaign is designed to put such pressure on the ,Public
Iranian people that they choose not to endure it but demand that the ,Public
nuclear program be scaled back or ended or that the regime that has ,Public
  This assassination undercuts that effort by building support for the ,Public
regime and its nuclear program with most of the Iranian people by ,Public

resolution. I rise in total support of the decision to remove Qasem ,Public
  I have heard the use of the word ``disproportionate'' from the ,Public
Speaker. I have heard it here today on the House floor and it is just ,Public
a shocking word to be used to describe what took place. It makes me ask ,Public
the question: At what point is it proportionate to take out a ,Public
designated terrorist who kills 600 U.S. troops wounds thousands of ,Public
others kills and wounds troops recently and his proxies attack a U.S. ,Public
  If anyone has any doubt as to what Qasem Soleimani was doing in Iraq ,Public
at the time we took him out you can look at the IRGC's own words. The ,Public
IRGC put out a statement saying that Soleimani and companions were on ,Public

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President in March the Senate narrowly passed a ,Public
resolution that would have misused the War Powers Act and actually ,Public
hampered efforts to bring the conflict in Yemen to a close. ,Public
  So today Members will have a second chance to send the right message ,Public
to our partners in the region to important humanitarian missions and ,Public
to eradicating al-Qaida from the Arabian Peninsula. I urge my ,Public
colleagues to vote to uphold the President's veto.,Public
  The resolution before us starts from false premises. We are not ,Public
parties to the civil war in Yemen. We are no longer providing even air-,Public
  More important the resolution would make it actually more difficult ,Public
to prevent the loss of innocent lives. This resolution would require ,Public
U.S. advisers to cease training and intelligence sharing operations ,Public
that help pilots avoid civilian casualties. And it would dry up U.S. ,Public
noncombat support to the weakened U.N.-recognized government in Yemen.,Public
  The resolution would also create serious new problems for the U.N.-,Public
led diplomatic mission that is doing all it can to negotiate an end to ,Public
  Abandoning our Yemeni Emirati and Saudi partners just as diplomatic ,Public
efforts are starting to make progress is hardly the way to give them ,Public
the confidence to take the hard diplomatic steps that are necessary.,Public
  An abrupt withdrawal of U.S. support for the coalition would be good ,Public
news for Iran for the Houthi rebels they support and of course al-,Public
  I share many of my colleagues' serious concerns about aspects of ,Public
Saudi Arabia's behavior but the best way for us to encourage better ,Public
behavior from our partners is to remain involved with Saudi Arabia and ,Public
the UAE not push them into the arms of Russia and China.,Public
  The War Powers Act is a blunt tool and not at all the right vehicle ,Public
to productively or diplomatically express concern about the behavior of ,Public
  The Senate passed a more nuanced resolution in December of last year ,Public
and it has many other tools to register concern and disapproval. If ,Public
Senators want to play a productive role in this conflict I would ,Public
encourage them to meet with Saudi Emirati and Yemeni officials to ,Public
travel to the region and to hold hearings on this important matter.,Public
  But for all the reasons I have laid out this particular resolution ,Public
is a particularly bad idea. I urge each of my colleagues to join me in ,Public
setting it aside and upholding the President's veto.,Public

the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) ,Public
pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During ,Public
consideration of this resolution all time yielded is for the purpose ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I ask unanimous consent that all Members ,Public
be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker yesterday the Rules Committee met and ,Public
reported a rule House Resolution 781 providing for consideration of ,Public
H. Con. Res. 83 under a closed rule. The resolution also provides 1 ,Public
hour of general debate controlled by the chair and ranking minority ,Public
  Madam Speaker the question before us today is very simple: Should ,Public
President Trump be allowed to send the United States hurtling toward ,Public
war with Iran without prior congressional approval?,Public
  It is a question we must wrestle with following the President's ,Public
actions last Thursday. That is when he ordered the lethal drone attack ,Public
on Iraqi soil that killed Iranian General Soleimani. The outgoing Prime ,Public
Minister has said the strike was carried out without Iraqi permission ,Public
or knowledge. It was done without any plan for the consequences in the ,Public
region or the world. And more troubling still it was carried out ,Public
without any input from the people's Representatives here in Congress.,Public
  Madam Speaker just a month ago Iran was staring down some of the ,Public
most intense antigovernment protests in a decade. Thousands took to the ,Public
streets of Tehran to express growing frustration and anger with their ,Public
  But what a difference a month makes. Protestors--men women and ,Public
children--have again taken to the streets of Tehran. Only this time ,Public
their anger wasn't directed at their own leaders; it was directed at ,Public
the United States of America--all because of the President's unilateral ,Public
  Madam Speaker that is what happens when monumental decisions of war ,Public
and peace are made in a vacuum with no regard for the consequences. ,Public
  Rather than protect our national security and stabilize the region ,Public
President Trump's reckless decision to strike Soleimani united Iran. It ,Public
has led to retaliatory strikes on two bases used by U.S. and coalition ,Public
forces in Iraq and it has put our troops and diplomats serving ,Public
  Now make no mistake: This decision has endangered all Americans ,Public
everywhere. Hardliners are emboldened; 4000 more U.S. troops have been ,Public
deployed to the region; operations against ISIS have been suspended; ,Public
the Iraqi Parliament has voted to kick American troops out of Iraq--all ,Public
because of the brash decision of one man: the President of the United ,Public
  Madam Speaker there was no question that Soleimani was a ruthless ,Public
military commander. He had American Syrian Lebanese Iraqi and ,Public
Yemeni blood on his hands. But that is not up for debate today nor is ,Public
the question of whether or not killing him was a good or bad idea.,Public
  The President of the United States assassinated a high-level foreign ,Public
military commander without asking or even notifying Congress ,Public
  Madam Speaker with little evidence the President claims his actions ,Public
prevented an imminent threat but the American people have heard that ,Public
one before. We remember the stories about weapons of mass destruction ,Public
in Iraq. We remember the tens of thousands of American soldiers who ,Public
  Madam Speaker is this Congress going to sit by and allow that to ,Public
happen in Iran or are we going to ensure that this body acts before a ,Public
war begins that could continue long after President Trump leaves ,Public
  Now the Constitution is clear; it is crystal clear. Article I ,Public
Section 8 gives Congress the power to declare war but President Trump ,Public
treated Congress as if it were an afterthought in a decision that has ,Public
  More than 4000 of our brave men and women are now being sent to the ,Public
Persian Gulf all without any input from the people's Chamber.,Public
  We represent the brave young men and women who are deploying to ,Public
Kuwait; we represent those deploying to Iraq; and we represent those ,Public
deploying elsewhere across the Middle East. Each of us speaks for them ,Public
and we speak for their families who are scared sick as their loved ,Public
  Madam Speaker we must summon the courage to be their voice.,Public
  Now I am glad that the United States and Iran have taken a step back ,Public
from the brink of war but what we heard from the President yesterday ,Public
was more of the same bluster. It is clear even after the briefing by ,Public
the administration yesterday that many of us attended that he has no ,Public
  Now make no mistake: The world is less safe because of Trump's ,Public
chaotic foreign policy. The impacts of his strikes are still ,Public
reverberating in the region and across the world and we cannot sit ,Public
  The Constitution makes the President Commander in Chief but it gives ,Public
only Congress the power to declare war. The Founders knew that ,Public
decisions of this magnitude required consultation between the branches ,Public
House no matter who controls the majority on Capitol Hill.,Public
  Our Democrats don't want war with Iran; most Reans don't want ,Public
war with Iran; and the American people certainly don't want a war with ,Public
Iran. I think that would be catastrophic. We should be stopping costly ,Public
  But whatever you believe have the courage of your conviction have ,Public
the courage to vote and that is what the underlying War Powers ,Public
Resolution is all about. Congress needs to authorize any additional ,Public
  Madam Speaker these decisions aren't easy. I understand that. There ,Public
is no more consequential vote than deciding whether to send men and ,Public
women off to war and into harm's way. We weigh that decision knowing ,Public
that despite our hopes and prayers lives are lost in combat.,Public
  Mothers and fathers could lose their children. Kids could be forced ,Public
  But when we were sworn in each of us took an oath to defend the ,Public
Constitution and that means wrestling with this very tough decision ,Public
when necessary. The only question now is whether we have the guts to ,Public
  Madam Speaker with the Middle East held captive to the whims of a ,Public
reckless President and with the Commander in Chief without a clue I ,Public
  On behalf of our troops their families and the American people I ,Public
urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying resolution.,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may ,Public
  I thank Mr. McGovern for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.,Public
  Today we consider H. Con. Res. 83 or technically we are ,Public
considering the rule to consider H. Con. Res. 83 a resolution to ,Public
remove the United States Armed Forces from hostilities in Iran.,Public
  But the thing is we are not engaged in hostilities in Iran. Once ,Public
again we are considering a measure that will have no force of law. ,Public
  There was some debate in the Rules Committee last night on whether a ,Public
concurrent resolution under the War Powers Resolution is in fact ,Public
nonbinding. But in the Senate a joint resolution has been introduced ,Public
making it likely that this House Concurrent Resolution will go no ,Public
  The Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war. The ,Public
Constitution also designates the President as the Commander in Chief of ,Public
the Armed Forces. This sets up a conflict. The courts have not ,Public
delineated the boundaries of these authorities or determined gaps ,Public
between them that would either deny power to a President or to the ,Public
  In Federalist Number 69 Alexander Hamilton argued the President's ,Public
power resides only in the direction of the military as placed by law at ,Public
his command. Presidents have long argued that their role as Commander ,Public
in Chief coupled with their inherent authority over foreign affairs ,Public
grants them the power to engage the Armed Forces short of war as they ,Public
  Since the founding of our country the Supreme Court has ruled both ,Public
that the President enjoys greater discretion when acting with respect ,Public
to matters of foreign affairs and that absent an authorization of ,Public
action during wartime any action by the President was void.,Public
  Despite the struggle to maintain the separation of powers with regard ,Public
to engaging our Armed Forces the motivation underlying the inclusion ,Public
in the Constitution of these powers for both the President and the ,Public
Congress continues to this day: The desire to protect and defend the ,Public
  Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973 largely in ,Public
response to the experiences in Korea and Vietnam. The War Powers ,Public
Resolution authorizes the engagement of the forces of the United States ,Public
in hostilities when: There is a declaration of war; or there exists a ,Public
specific statutory authorization; or a national emergency created by ,Public
attack upon the United States its territories or possessions or its ,Public
  To assess the current situation let's examine what has led us to ,Public
  In June of 2019 Iran shot down a surveillance aircraft that was ,Public
flying over international waters near the Strait of Hormuz. This was an ,Public
  At the time President Trump was advised by his military advisers to ,Public
strike back but the President opted not to strike back because it ,Public
would have resulted in Iranian casualties and he felt he could not ,Public
justify creation of human casualties because of the loss of a machine. ,Public
I agree with the President in that decision. I think his restraint was ,Public
  In September of 2019 Iranian cruise missiles struck nearly 20 ,Public
targets of critical energy infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. This ,Public
disrupted a significant portion of Saudi oil production.,Public
  In December of 2019 Iranian-backed forces in Iraq targeted military ,Public
facilities where United States forces were co-located.,Public
  On December 27 an Iranian-backed Hezbollah group a U.S.-designated ,Public
foreign terrorist organization attacked a base in northern Iraq and ,Public
they killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four U.S. servicemembers.,Public
  The United States responded and it launched a retaliatory air strike ,Public
  On January 2 2020 acting on intelligence of imminent threat to ,Public
American interests and in response to the persistent attack by ,Public
Iranian-backed entities the United States military killed General ,Public
Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was the long-time leader of the Iran ,Public
  The Iran Revolutionary Guard is a U.S.-designated terrorist ,Public
organization. It has been supporting proxy forces throughout the Middle ,Public
East and attacking United States interests and allies for over a ,Public
  Soleimani previously operated under strict security but in recent ,Public
years he has moved much more freely and openly believing that the ,Public
United States did not have the willpower to be able to attack him. His ,Public
atrocities include the deaths of hundreds of Americans and the ,Public
attempted assassination of a Saudi diplomat in the United States among ,Public
  President Obama's former Secretary of Homeland Security Secretary ,Public
Jeh Johnson stated that General Soleimani was a legitimate military ,Public
  I do want to be clear. The last thing that I want to see and I ,Public
suspect anyone in this body wants to see is our men and women committed ,Public
to another conflict in the Middle East. We want those conflicts to end ,Public
  But Madam Speaker today the world is a safer place without General ,Public
  Despite the disagreement in how further to engage in the Middle East ,Public
in the country of Iran be it militarily or diplomatically the last ,Public
thing we should be doing is broadcasting our plans to the enemy.,Public
  By passing this War Powers Resolution directing the President to ,Public
remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities with Iran a point ,Public
that is in itself in contention we are effectively telling the ,Public
Iranian mullahs that it is okay to push forward with their aggressive ,Public
posturing. Rather than stating what the President cannot do perhaps we ,Public
  Last night in the Rules Committee it became clear that both ,Public
Reans and Democrats agree that the world is a safer place without ,Public
General Soleimani and any war with Iran needs to be authorized by ,Public
  Democrats want to maintain the separation of powers as do I but the ,Public
question is to what extent are we jeopardizing our safety?,Public
  I believe Congress does need to authorize military action and ,Public
maintain the separation of powers as intended by the Founders but we ,Public
  While we may be divided on the need for this resolution let us ,Public
recognize the privilege that we enjoy each and every day being able to ,Public
stand in this House and debate these issues without fear of,Public
retribution of our government. Those protesters in Iran did not enjoy ,Public
that freedom. They cut off the internet and eliminated those ,Public
protesters. That is why you don't see them anymore.,Public
  Madam Speaker I urge opposition to this rule and I reserve the ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may ,Public
  Let me just respond to the gentleman when he says that this is a ,Public
concurrent resolution here in the House and it is nonbinding and merely ,Public
symbolic. Let me point out to him that the law states clearly that this ,Public
sort of resolution reins in the President. The War Powers Resolution ,Public
requires the President to stop using American forces and hostilities if ,Public
  Moreover the Constitution gives war powers to the Congress not to ,Public
the President. And if both Houses pass this resolution it is a clear ,Public
statement that Congress is denying the President the authority to wage ,Public
war and that the President must come to Congress for an authorization ,Public
  And by the way we are not just pursuing a concurrent resolution. ,Public
Senator Kaine of Virginia over in the Senate is pursuing a joint ,Public
resolution; so we are covering all bases here because we are deeply ,Public
concerned that we may end up in a war inadvertently here and that ,Public
  Again I would urge the gentleman to read the War Powers Resolution. ,Public
I have a copy here and the accompanying report when this resolution ,Public
was signed into law. The report with regard to consultation is ,Public
crystal clear that consultation is meant prior to introducing our ,Public
forces and engaging into hostilities which is something the President ,Public
  And in terms of the President's exercising this remarkable restraint ,Public
I just have a very different opinion. Have you read his Twitter ,Public
account? Have you been listening to him on TV as he brags about the ,Public
shiny expensive weapons we have that he would love to use? The ,Public
rhetoric the threat to bomb cultural sites which is a war crime? I ,Public
mean the gentleman may be totally at ease with all of that but I am ,Public
not; and most of the American people are scared as hell of this ,Public
President's rhetoric when it comes to a potential war with Iran.,Public
  All we are saying here is that we ought to stand up for this ,Public
institution and stand with the Constitution and make it very clear ,Public
that if the President wants to go to war in Iran that he needs to come ,Public
to Congress to get that declaration to get that authorization.,Public
  Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. ,Public
  Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker I rise in strong support of the War ,Public
Powers Resolution to limit the President's military actions regarding ,Public
  As a Member of Congress one of our most sacred votes is our vote to ,Public
declare war. We therefore have an obligation to study the evidence ,Public
and share concerns about the administration's decision to engage in ,Public
hostilities against Iran. We have a duty to question its strategy or ,Public
  My expertise Madam Speaker is not foreign policy but I know Iran. ,Public
I lived there. I worked there as a Peace Corps volunteer many years ,Public
ago. I have been a student of Iranian history and politics for more ,Public
  There is no question about Iran's role in sponsoring terrorism. ,Public
Soleimani himself was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of ,Public
Americans and thousands around the world. He actively worked to foment ,Public
instability across the Middle East on behalf of the government of Iran.,Public
  Nevertheless the President of the United States in his response to ,Public
Iran announced that he would commit a war crime by targeting Iran's ,Public
extraordinary cultural sites. War crimes. No matter who is President of ,Public
the United States when he or she indicates that they are prepared to ,Public
commit a war crime then Congress better step up and reassert its ,Public
  We must demand that the President justify any act and that is what ,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker let me yield myself 30 seconds for the ,Public
  And my response would be had the gentleman from Massachusetts ,Public
yielded to me for a question my question was going to be was he ,Public
asking for unanimous consent to change the concurrent resolution to a ,Public
joint resolution such that it could align and harmonize with the Senate ,Public
activity and then therefore maybe accomplish something. But he ,Public
  Madam Speaker I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. ,Public
  Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker I want to thank my good friend Dr. Burgess ,Public
  I rise Madam Speaker in reluctant opposition quite frankly to ,Public
  As my good friend Chairman McGovern knows we have actually worked ,Public
together to try and expand and reclaim war-making authority for the ,Public
Congress of the United States and I would offer and continue to work ,Public
with him in that partnership. I think that is something that needs to ,Public
  I also think we have no difference that if we were to engage in a war ,Public
with Iraq it would require congressional authorization. And frankly ,Public
last night in the Rules Committee I offered a process whereby we ,Public
could work together in a bipartisan fashion; that is let's just follow ,Public
the War Powers Resolution. Let's submit something to the committee of ,Public
jurisdiction which is actually the Foreign Affairs Committee. We have ,Public
a deadline or a timeline laid out in the War Powers Act; they could ,Public
operate within that. Within a matter of a few weeks we would then in a ,Public
very bipartisan manner bring something to the floor.,Public
  Let's contrast that with how this particular resolution came to the ,Public
floor. We got it about 45 minutes before the Rules Committee meeting. ,Public
It is written in the Speaker's Office; rewritten in the Speaker's ,Public
Office and it is sent down here to make a political point not to ,Public
actually do something that would substantively restore congressional ,Public
war-making power. This is all politics; that is all it is.,Public
  The political aim here is for our friends to suggest that the ,Public
President either wants war with Iran or has acted hastily ,Public
precipitously and recklessly. Neither of those things is true.,Public
  Frankly our latest dispute with Iran begins with the decision by ,Public
this administration appropriately to withdraw from the very ill-advised ,Public
Iranian nuclear deal a deal by the way that the majority of this ,Public
House and the majority of the United States Senate opposed but ,Public
  What has been the Iranian response to our withdrawal? A series of ,Public
provocations to which as my good friend Mr. Burgess pointed out the ,Public
President by and large has acted with remarkable restraint. Let's ,Public
  First it was attacks on ships in the Strait of Hormuz in the gulf. ,Public
What was the President's response? Well let's organize an ,Public
international flotilla to defend these ships. He did not attack Iran.,Public
  Next as my good friend from Texas pointed out we see strikes into ,Public
Iraq itself. Particularly we see an attack on Saudi Arabian oil ,Public
refineries. What is the President's response? Well let's not attack ,Public
Iran. Let's send defensive capabilities from our country there and ,Public
  Then we see attacks on American forces in Iraq. What is the ,Public
President's response? As my friend pointed out let's go after the Shia ,Public
  Finally after that when the President responds we see another ,Public
attack. In that attack as my friend pointed out an American ,Public
contractor died and four American servicemembers were wounded. Again ,Public
  Then the next response our embassy is assaulted. Thank goodness no ,Public
loss of life but I think the President had had enough.,Public
  By the way just after that assault happens who magically shows up ,Public
in violation of a U.N. resolution in Iraq? Our good friend General ,Public
Soleimani a designated terrorist for 13 years a person who has killed ,Public
hundreds of Americans wounded thousands more not to,Public
mention the tens of thousands across the region. What does the ,Public
President do? The President takes out a legitimate terrorist target. In ,Public
Iran? No the President doesn't want to do that. He does it in Iraq.,Public
  Now how anybody could have any doubt about the President's desire ,Public
to number one strike at a terrorist and number two avoid war I ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 1 minute to the ,Public
  Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker passing this resolution as my good friend ,Public
Dr. Burgess suggested sends the wrong message to the wrong people at ,Public
  The President did the right thing here. He has acted in a restrained ,Public
manner. He has endured and our country has endured endless ,Public
  We should reject this rule. Frankly we should have a regular process ,Public
where we actually go back to the committee of jurisdiction. We should ,Public
  Before I conclude I want to mention I know my friend is very sincere ,Public
in his opinions on expanding congressional war power. There is no doubt ,Public
in my mind about it. We have worked on that before. I look forward to ,Public
working with my friend on that issue again. This is the wrong vehicle ,Public
the wrong place the wrong time the wrong consequences for our own ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker let me say to the gentleman from ,Public
Oklahoma that I look forward to working with him on the war powers and ,Public
other issues related to the executive branch encroaching on legislative ,Public

 As Tensions With Iran Escalated Trump Opted for Most Extreme Measure,Public
     (By Helene Cooper Eric Schmitt Maggie Haberman and Rukmini ,Public
       Washington.--In the chaotic days leading to the death of ,Public
     Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani Iran's most powerful commander ,Public
     top American military officials put the option of killing ,Public
     him--which they viewed as the most extreme response to recent ,Public
     Iranian-led violence in Iraq--on the menu they presented to ,Public
       They didn't think he would take it. In the wars waged since ,Public
     the Sept. 11 2001 attacks Pentagon officials have often ,Public
     offered improbable options to presidents to make other ,Public
       After initially rejecting the Suleimani option on Dec. 28 ,Public
     and authorizing airstrikes on an Iranian-backed Shiite ,Public
     militia group instead a few days later Mr. Trump watched ,Public
     fuming as television reports showed Iranian-backed attacks ,Public
     on the American Embassy in Baghdad according to Defense ,Public
       By late Thursday the president had gone for the extreme ,Public
       Mr. Trump made the decision senior officials said on ,Public
     Saturday despite disputes in the administration about the ,Public
     significance of what some officials said was a new stream of ,Public
     intelligence that warned of threats to American embassies ,Public
     consulates and military personnel in Syria Iraq and Lebanon. ,Public
     General Suleimani had just completed a tour of his forces in ,Public
     Syria Lebanon and Iraq and was planning an ``imminent'' ,Public
     attack that could claim hundreds of lives those officials ,Public
       ``Days weeks'' Gen. Mark A. Milley the chairman of the ,Public
     Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Friday when asked how ,Public
     imminent any attacks could be without offering more detail ,Public
     other than to say that new information about unspecified ,Public
       But some officials voiced private skepticism about the ,Public
     rationale for a strike on General Suleimani who was ,Public
     responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American troops ,Public
     over the years. According to one United States official the ,Public
     new intelligence indicated ``a normal Monday in the Middle ,Public
     East''--Dec. 30--and General Suleimani's travels amounted to ,Public
       That official described the intelligence as thin and said ,Public
     that General Suleimani's attack was not imminent because of ,Public
     communications the United States had between Iran's supreme ,Public
     leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and General Suleimani showing ,Public
     that the ayatollah had not yet approved any plans by the ,Public
     general for an attack. The ayatollah according to the ,Public
     communications had asked General Suleimani to come to Tehran ,Public
     for further discussions at least a week before his death.,Public
       Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike ,Public
     Pence were two of the most hawkish voices arguing for a ,Public
     response to Iranian aggression according to administration ,Public
     officials. Mr. Pence's office helped run herd on meetings and ,Public
     conference calls held by officials in the run-up to the ,Public
       Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and General Milley declined ,Public
     spokeswoman Col. DeDe Halfhill said without elaborating ,Public
     that ``some of the characterizations being asserted by other ,Public
     sources are false'' and that she would not discuss ,Public
     conversations between General Milley and the president.,Public
       The fallout from Mr. Trump's targeted killing is now ,Public
     underway. On Saturday in Iraq the American military was on ,Public
     alert as tens of thousands of pro-Iranian fighters marched ,Public
     through the streets of Baghdad and calls accelerated to eject ,Public
     the United States from the country. United States Central ,Public
     Command which oversees American military operations in the ,Public
     Middle East said there were two rocket attacks near Iraqi ,Public
     bases that host American troops but no one was injured.,Public
       In Iran the ayatollah vowed ``forceful revenge'' as the ,Public
       In Palm Beach Fla. Mr. Trump lashed back promising to ,Public
     strike 52 sites across Iran--representing the number of ,Public
     American hostages taken by Iran in 1979--if Iran attacked ,Public
     Americans or American interests. On Saturday night Mr. Trump ,Public
     warned on Twitter that some sites were ``at a very high level ,Public
     & important to Iran & the Iranian culture and those targets ,Public
     and Iran itself WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.'',Public
       The president issued those warnings after American spy ,Public
     agencies on Saturday detected that Iranian ballistic missile ,Public
     units across the country had gone to a heightened state of ,Public
     readiness a United States official said on Saturday night.,Public
       Other officials said it was unclear whether Iran was ,Public
     dispersing its ballistic missile units--the heart of the ,Public
     Iranian military--to avoid American attack or was mobilizing ,Public
     the units for a major strike against American targets or ,Public
     allies in the region in retaliation for General Suleimani' s ,Public
       On Capitol Hill Democrats voiced growing suspicions about ,Public
     the intelligence that led to the killing. At the White House ,Public
     officials formally notified Congress of a war powers ,Public
     resolution with what the administration said was a legal ,Public
     largest rapid deployments in decades are bound for the ,Public
       General Suleimani who was considered the most important ,Public
     person in Iran after Ayatollah Khamenei was a commanding ,Public
     general of a sovereign government. The last time the United ,Public
     States killed a major military leader in a foreign country ,Public
     was during World War II when the American military shot down ,Public
     the plane carrying the Japanese admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.,Public
       But administration officials are playing down General ,Public
     Suleimani's status as a part of the Iranian state suggesting ,Public
     his title gave him cover for terrorist activities. In the ,Public
     days since his death they have sought to describe the strike ,Public
     as more in line with the killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the ,Public
     Islamic State leader who died in October in an American ,Public
       Administration officials insisted they did not anticipate ,Public
     sweeping retaliation from Iran in part because of divisions ,Public
     in the Iranian leadership. But Mr. Trump's two predecessors--,Public
       General Suleimani had been in Mr. Trump's sights since the ,Public
     beginning of the administration although it was a Dec. 27 ,Public
     rocket attack on an Iraqi military base outside Kirkuk which ,Public
     left an American civilian contractor dead that set the ,Public
       General Milley and Mr. Esper traveled on Sunday to Mar-a-,Public
     Lago Mr. Trump's Palm Beach resort a day after officials ,Public
     presented the president with an initial list of options for ,Public
     how to deal with escalating violence against American targets ,Public
       The options included strikes on Iranian ships or missile ,Public
     facilities or against Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq. ,Public
     The Pentagon also tacked on the choice of targeting General ,Public
     Suleimani mainly to make other options seem reasonable.,Public
       Mr. Trump chose strikes against militia groups. On Sunday ,Public
     the Pentagon announced that airstrikes approved by the ,Public
     president had struck three locations in Iraq and two in Syria ,Public
       Jonathan Hoffman the chief Pentagon spokesman said the ,Public
     targets included weapons storage facilities and command posts ,Public
     used to attack American and partner forces. About two dozen ,Public
       ``These were on remote sites'' General Milley told ,Public
     reporters on Friday in his Pentagon office. ``There was no ,Public
       But the Iranians viewed the strikes as out of proportion to ,Public
     their attack on the Iraqi base and Iraqis largely member's ,Public
     of Iranian-backed militias staged violent protests outside ,Public
     the American Embassy in Baghdad. Mr. Trump who aides said ,Public
     had on his mind the specter of the 2012 attacks on the ,Public
     American compound in Benghazi Libya became increasingly ,Public
     angry as he watched television images of pro-Iranian ,Public
     demonstrators storming the embassy. Aides said he worried ,Public
     that no response would look weak after repeated threats by ,Public
       When Mr. Trump chose the option of killing General ,Public
     Suleimani top military officials flabbergasted were ,Public
     alarmed about the prospect of Iranian retaliatory strikes on ,Public
     American troops in the region. It is unclear if General ,Public
     Milley or Mr. Esper pushed back on the president's decision.,Public
     Operations Command looked for an opportunity to hit General ,Public
     Suleimani who operated in the open and was treated like a ,Public
     celebrity in many places he visited in the Middle East. ,Public
     Military and intelligence officials said the strike drew on ,Public
     information from secret informants electronic intercepts ,Public
     reconnaissance aircraft and other surveillance tools.,Public
       The option that was eventually approved depended on who ,Public
     would greet General Suleimani at his expected arrival on ,Public
     Friday at Baghdad International Airport. If he was met by ,Public
     Iraqi government officials allied with Americans one ,Public
     American official said the strike would be called off. But ,Public
     the official said it was a ``clean party'' meaning members ,Public
     of Kataib Hezbollah including its leader Abu Mahdi al-,Public
     Muhandis. Mr. Trump authorized the killing at about 5 p.m. on ,Public
       On Friday missiles fired from an American MQ-9 Reaper blew ,Public
     up General Suleimani's convoy as it departed the airport.,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ,Public
New York (Mr. Morelle) a member of the Rules Committee.,Public
  Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker I thank the distinguished chair and my ,Public
colleague from the Rules Committee Mr. McGovern for yielding me this ,Public
  We begin the new year in turbulent and uncertain times particularly ,Public
with regard to Iran and the Middle East. Protecting our national ,Public
interests and securing the safety and security of the American people ,Public
must be the highest priorities of our government. I am gravely ,Public
concerned the recent actions of the Trump administration have ,Public
destabilized the region and undermined those priorities.,Public
  Article I of the United States Constitution vests in the House and ,Public
Senate the responsibility to declare war to appropriate money for the ,Public
national defense and in doing so to ensure no President employs ,Public
military action without careful consultation of and authorization by ,Public
  That is why it is so important that we take action to reaffirm these ,Public
responsibilities by passing the resolution before us which I am proud ,Public
  The use of United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities ,Public
against Iran must come only after thoughtful deliberation and approval ,Public
by Congress. As we move forward we must all seek to achieve a peaceful ,Public
resolution that protects American interests at home and abroad.,Public
  I join with all Americans in praying for the safety of our courageous ,Public
servicemembers and urge my colleagues to support this rule and the ,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from ,Public
Arizona (Mrs. Lesko) a valuable member of the House Committee on ,Public
  Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding.,Public
  First I thank President Trump for making a decisive action to ,Public
  The world now knows that Obama's appeasement strategy policies ,Public
including giving billions of dollars to Iran are over. It didn't work. ,Public
The world knows that when President Trump says we are not going to ,Public
  In Rules Committee last night and again today I listened as my ,Public
Democratic colleagues claim what this resolution is all about. They ,Public
claim that it is about making sure Congress exerts its authority to ,Public
approve future war against Iran. But that is not what this resolution ,Public
  In fact let's read the title of this resolution. It says: ,Public
``Directing the President pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers ,Public
Resolution to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces to engage ,Public
in hostilities in or against Iran.'' It doesn't say anything about ,Public
  We do not currently have U.S. Armed Forces engaged in hostilities in ,Public
or against Iran. If Democrats are serious about making sure Congress ,Public
has its say in declaring war they would follow the statutory ,Public
guidelines as described by Representative Cole. They are already in ,Public
  Instead Democrats have chosen to short circuit the process yet again ,Public
  As a member of the Rules Committee I saw the language of the ,Public
resolution 45 minutes before the Rules Committee started. This is not a ,Public
  Here are the facts. Iran and Iranian-backed militias have escalated ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 30 seconds to the ,Public
  Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker in June 2019 Iran shot down a U.S. drone. ,Public
Trump said no we are not going to retaliate because no U.S. lives ,Public
were lost. Iran attacked Saudi oil fields. Iran-backed militia killed a ,Public
U.S. citizen and wounded four troops. Then an Iran-backed militia ,Public
  Soleimani was a terrorist designated by the Obama administration.,Public
  Let me read very quickly what the Joint Chiefs of Staff have said. He ,Public
has had 40 years of military experience under all different ,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again ,Public
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker I yield an additional 30 seconds to the ,Public
  Mrs. LESKO. General Milley said the trigger for the drone strike that ,Public
killed Soleimani was ``clear unambiguous intelligence indicating a ,Public
significant campaign of violence against the United States in the days ,Public
weeks and months'' and that the administration would have been ,Public
  This is a man who has been in the military for 40 years under ,Public
different administrations and you are going to doubt what he has to ,Public
  I thank President Trump for protecting American citizens.,Public
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I include in the Record a January 8 ,Public
Vanity Fair article entitled ``There Is No Strategy: Diplomats React to ,Public
     ``There Is No Strategy'': Diplomats React to Trump's Erratic ,Public
       After the American drone strike and Iran's measured ,Public
     retaliation some State vets worry that Trump is a wild card ,Public
     the biggest danger: ``From a political standpoint'' says ,Public
     one ``they have behaved a hell of a lot more rationally and ,Public
       In the aftermath of Iran's strike against two airbases in ,Public
     retaliation for the drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani ,Public
     last week a sigh of relief was breathed but for what? That ,Public
     there had been no casualties from Iran's cruise missiles was ,Public
     a huge reason to be thankful. (U.S. officials have since ,Public
     suggested this was intentional.) But there was also a sense ,Public
     of relief that Trump had stepped back--as if he were the wild ,Public
     card. The developments laid bare what diplomats I spoke with ,Public
     identified as a discomforting reality in the Trump era. ``Up ,Public
     is down and down is up'' a former U.S. ambassador in the ,Public
     region told me noting Iran's decision to notify the Iraqis ,Public
     ahead of the attack on Tuesday and Mohammad Javad Zarif's ,Public
     message of detente in the face of Trump's bluster. ``Who ,Public
     would've imagined that it's the American president who is a ,Public
     crazy person gunning for war and the mullahs who are being ,Public
     careful and deliberate and cautious . . . . They have done ,Public
     terrible things--I am not going to defend the fact that the ,Public
     country holds hostages and has absolutely supported terrorist ,Public
     groups and those sorts of things--but from a political ,Public
     standpoint they have behaved a hell of a lot more rationally ,Public
     and predictably than we have'' this person added. ``Do you ,Public
     take comfort in the fact that Iran is the rational actor or ,Public
     does that scare the bejesus out of you even more?'',Public
       A former Foreign Service Officer who worked on Iran under ,Public
     Barack Obama echoed the point. ``I think it is interesting ,Public
     that [Iran has taken] every opportunity to show that they're ,Public
     actually more responsible than the U.S. president in ,Public
     executing this conflict'' this person said. ``It boggles the ,Public
     mind to me that we are almost more concerned I think about ,Public
     our own president than we are about the way others may ,Public
       Diplomats I spoke with are clear-eyed in their belief that ,Public
     Iran's retaliation for Soleimani is not complete; they are ,Public
     bracing for--if not further military attacks--subsequent ,Public
     responses such as cyberattacks or even kidnappings. To a ,Public
     fault they too are not defending Iran's past malfeasance. ,Public
     And Trump's position on the wake of the attacks is welcomed ,Public
     ``President Trump made the right decision not to respond to ,Public
     Iran's missile attacks. There were no American casualties and ,Public
     the Iranians are clearly signaling they don't want a war'' ,Public
     Nicholas Burns the former ambassador to NATO told me. The ,Public
     problem is that Trump has thus far failed to chart a path ,Public
     forward with Iran. Instead he has shuttled between slamming ,Public
     Iran slighting his predecessor's signature Iran nuclear ,Public
     deal and patting himself on the back for the death of ,Public
     Soleimani and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi the former leader of the ,Public
     Islamic State whom the United States killed in October. ``His ,Public
     speech was confusing about his strategy. It is not at all ,Public
     clear if he intends to contain Iran through deterrence or to ,Public
     weaken its government and seek regime change'' Burns added. ,Public
     ``He owes the American  the Congress and our allies a ,Public
     much more specific and consistent game plan. Otherwise it ,Public
     will be difficult for him to gain domestic and allied ,Public
       As I reported in the aftermath of the Soleimani's killing ,Public
     last week a chief concern within the diplomatic ranks was ,Public
     that the Trump administration still lacking a coherent ,Public
     foreign policy had failed to adequately contemplate and ,Public
     prepare for the international and Iranian response to the ,Public
     airstrike against the top Iranian general. Indeed the Trump ,Public
     administration certainly appeared to be caught flat-footed ,Public
     when the Iraqi parliament voted to expel U.S. troops from the ,Public
     country over the weekend. While asserting that the killing of ,Public
     Soleimani left Americans safer Secretary of State Mike ,Public
     Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper have yet to detail ,Public
     the imminent threat they claim the Iranian general posed to ,Public
     U.S. interests. And Trump's remarks on Wednesday arguably ,Public
     raised more questions than they answered. As the former ,Public
     ambassador in the region put it ``There is no strategy. It ,Public
     is satisfying Trump's ego at every step. It's all it is for ,Public
     us there is zero strategy and it's all strategy on Iran's ,Public
       Beyond his ``America First'' tagline Trump has failed to ,Public
     formulate anything resembling a coherent foreign policy. ,Public
     Rather he has a domestic policy that influences American ,Public
     posturing abroad. The clearest through line in Trump's ,Public
     various foreign policy decisions can largely be summed up as ,Public
     ``the opposite of what Obama did.'' But this lack of ,Public
     coherence is particularly troubling in the Middle East and is ,Public
     amplified by the reality that he's surrounded by hawks with ,Public
     hard-ons for toppling the Iranian regime like Pompeo. ``The ,Public
     most frustrating thing is that this is entirely of his own ,Public
     making. You think about where we were less than five years ,Public
     ago when we got to the deal. Things certainly weren't ,Public
     perfect by any means. They were still causing a lot of harm ,Public
     and doing things against our interests in the region but ,Public
     compare that to where we are today and it is so entirely ,Public
     avoidable'' the former Foreign Service officer told me. ,Public
     ``The lack of a strategy continues to be the most dangerous ,Public
       A former high-ranking State Department official expressed ,Public
     similar dismay. ``Foreign policy isn't well-done on impulse. ,Public
     Because so much is intertwined . . . . It requires the ,Public
     ability to understand the trade-offs and possible longer-term ,Public
     impacts. Never easy. But this team has no ability to do ,Public
     that'' they told me. ``If I were a military family member ,Public
     I'd really worry that our troops are being sent out with no ,Public
     clear plan or mission. Not a comforting thought.'',Public
       If Trump really does have an appetite for diplomacy that's ,Public
     undeniably a positive development. Diplomats stress that now ,Public
     is the time for it and the Iranians do seem to be signaling ,Public
     a desire deescalate. ``Now we're in the time of intense ,Public
     diplomacy where around the world leaders are figuring out ,Public
     `If you do this I do that' and 'What will be the response of ,Public
     X if we do Y' '' a former senior U.S. official told me. But ,Public
     this person added ``The only ones not taking part are the ,Public
     Americans.'' Instead ``America is content with a two-,Public
     dimensional policy: We take this act we stand still and ,Public
     watch what happens. The other countries are at least trying ,Public
     to be three-dimensional adding the element of time ,Public
     projecting to the not-too-distant future which advantages are ,Public
       In an ideal world Burns said Trump would open a reliable ,Public
     diplomatic channel to Tehran. ``We should want to be able to ,Public
     deliver tough and clear messages to its government. And it ,Public
     would be smart to offer Iran a diplomatic off-ramp so that we ,Public
     can end the possibility of a wider war that is in neither of ,Public
     our interests'' he said. ``Trump's disinterest in real ,Public
     diplomacy is a significant disadvantage for the U.S.'',Public
       Confronting a president who has repeatedly demonstrated a ,Public
     desire to dive into military conflict before diplomacy ,Public
     Congress is grappling with how to restrain Trump. California ,Public
     congressman Ro Khanna told me the attacks on Tuesday increase ,Public
     ``the urgency for Congress to act. We need to engage in de-,Public
     escalation and a cease-fire to end the cycle of violence.'' ,Public
     Currently on the table are a few measures House Democrats ,Public
     hope can curb Trump's authority to attack Iran. Among them ,Public
     are a War Powers Resolution and a bill drafted by Khanna and ,Public
     Senator Bernie Sanders that would defund any offensive action ,Public
     in Iran and require any such action to have Congressional ,Public
       Khanna told me that the Democratic caucus is unified and ,Public
     that he has been in talks with Speaker Nancy Pelosi about ,Public
     timing and process. The House is expected to vote on a War ,Public
     Powers Resolution after which they would push his bill with ,Public
     Senator Sanders. Currently House leadership is figuring how ,Public
     to craft a War Powers Resolution in a way that would prevent ,Public
     Reans from attaching a Motion to Recommit which could ,Public
     prevent it from reaching the Senate floor--as was the case ,Public
     with the War Powers Resolution on Yemen. ``That is why it is ,Public
     taking some time'' Khanna explained. ``It is taking time to ,Public
     figure out the procedural mechanisms with the parliamentarian ,Public
     in the House and the Senate so that what we send over to the ,Public
     Senate doesn't lose its War Powers privileged status. If it ,Public
     loses its privileged status then [Mitch] McConnell would ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may ,Public
consume to respond to the gentlewoman. I urge the gentlewoman who read ,Public
a couple of lines from the resolution as I urge all of my colleagues ,Public
  This is pretty simple. Basically it says that if we go to war with ,Public
Iran Congress ought to have a say in it. Congress ought to do what the ,Public

  In 2002 I was here and I offer these words from my statement on the ,Public
floor regarding President Bush. ``Always a question of the greatest ,Public
importance our decision today'' in 2002 ``is further weighted by the ,Public
fact that we are being asked to sanction a new foreign policy doctrine ,Public

Summary of Information Regarding U.S. Counterterrorism Strikes Outside ,Public
       In accordance with the President's direction and consistent ,Public
     with the President's commitment to providing as much ,Public
     information as possible to the American people about U.S. ,Public
     counterterrorism activities the Director of National ,Public
     Intelligence (DNI) is releasing today a summary of ,Public
     information provided to the DNI about both the number of ,Public
     strikes taken by the U.S. Government against terrorist ,Public
     targets outside areas of active hostilities and the assessed ,Public
     number of combatant and non-combatant deaths resulting from ,Public
     those strikes. ``Areas of active hostilities'' currently ,Public

       Total number of strikes against terrorist targets outside ,Public
       The assessed range of non-combatant deaths provided to the ,Public
     DNI reflects consideration of credible reports of non-,Public
     combatant deaths drawn from all-source information including ,Public
     governmental organizations. The assessed range of non-,Public
     combatant deaths includes deaths for which there is an ,Public
     insufficient basis for assessing that the deceased is a ,Public
      U.S. Government Post-Strike Review Processes and Procedures,Public
       The information that was provided to the DNI regarding ,Public
     combatant and non-combatant deaths is the result of processes ,Public
     that include careful reviews of all strikes after they are ,Public
     conducted to assess the effectiveness of operations. These ,Public
     review processes have evolved over time to ensure that they ,Public
     incorporate the best available all-source intelligence media ,Public
     reassessments of strikes if new information becomes available ,Public
     that alters the original judgment. The large volume of pre- ,Public
     and post-strike data available to the U.S. Government can ,Public
     enable analysts to distinguish combatants from non-,Public
     combatants conduct detailed battle damage assessments and ,Public
     separate reliable reporting from terrorist propaganda or from ,Public
     media reports that may be based on inaccurate information.,Public
 Discrepancies Between U.S. Government and Non-Governmental Assessments,Public
     acknowledges that there are differences between U.S. ,Public
     Government assessments and reporting from non-governmental ,Public
     organizations. Reports from non-governmental organizations ,Public
     can include both aggregate data regarding non-combatant ,Public
     deaths as well as case studies addressing particular strikes ,Public
     and generally rely on a combination of media reporting and ,Public
     in some instances field research conducted in areas of ,Public
     reported strikes. Although these organizations' reports of ,Public
     non-combatant deaths resulting from U.S. strikes against ,Public
     terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities vary ,Public
     widely such reporting generally estimates significantly ,Public
     higher figures for non-combatant deaths than is indicated by ,Public
     U.S. Government information. For instance for the period ,Public
     governmental organizations' estimates range from more than ,Public
     200 to slightly more than 900 possible non-combatant deaths ,Public
       Consistent with the requirements applicable to future ,Public
     reporting under Section 3(b) of the Executive Order ``United ,Public
     States Policy on Pre- and Post-Strike Measures to Address ,Public
     Civilian Casualties in U.S. Operations Involving the Use of ,Public
     Force'' the information we are releasing today addresses ,Public
     general reasons for discrepancies between post-strike ,Public
     assessments from the United States Government and credible ,Public
     reporting from non-governmental organizations regarding non-,Public
     combatant deaths and does not address specific incidents. ,Public
     There are a number of possible reasons that these non-,Public
     governmental organizations' reports of the number of ,Public
     noncombatants killed may differ from the U.S. Government ,Public
     assessments based on the information provided to the DNI.,Public
     determining the precise number of combatant and non-combatant ,Public
     deaths particularly when operating in non-permissive ,Public
     methodologies that have been refined and honed over the years ,Public
     and that use information that is generally unavailable to ,Public
     non-governmental organizations. The U.S. Government draws on ,Public
     all available information (including sensitive intelligence) ,Public
     to determine whether an individual is part of a belligerent ,Public
     party fighting against the United States in an armed ,Public
     conflict taking a direct part in hostilities against the ,Public
     United States or otherwise targetable in the exercise of ,Public
     national self-defense. Thus the U.S. Government may have ,Public
     reliable information that certain individuals are combatants ,Public
     but are being counted as non-combatants by nongovernmental ,Public
     individual's possible membership in an organized armed group ,Public
     may include among other things: the extent to which an ,Public
     individual performs functions for the benefit of the group ,Public
     that are analogous to those traditionally performed by ,Public
     members of a country's armed forces; whether that person is ,Public
     carrying out or giving orders to others within the group; or ,Public
     whether that person has undertaken certain acts that reliably ,Public
       Second according to information provided to the DNI U.S. ,Public
     Government post-strike reviews involve the collection and ,Public
     analysis of multiple sources of intelligence before during ,Public
     and after a strike including video observations human ,Public
     sources and assets signals intelligence geospatial ,Public
     intelligence accounts from local officials on the ground ,Public
     and open source reporting. Information collected before a ,Public
     strike is intended to provide clarity regarding the number of ,Public
     individuals at a strike location as well as whether the ,Public
     individuals are engaged in terrorist activity. Post-strike ,Public
     collection frequently enables U.S. Government analysts to ,Public
     confirm among other things the number of individuals killed ,Public
     as well as their combatant status. The information is then ,Public
     analyzed along with other all-source intelligence reporting. ,Public
     This combination of sources is unique and can provide ,Public
     insights that are likely unavailable to non-governmental ,Public
       Finally non-governmental organizations' reports of ,Public
     counterterrorism strikes attributed to the U.S. Government--,Public
     particularly their identification of non-combatant deaths--,Public
     may be further complicated by the deliberate spread of ,Public
     organizations in local media reports on which some non-,Public
       Although the U.S. Government has access to a wide range of ,Public
     information the figures released today should be considered ,Public
     in light of the inherent limitations on the ability to ,Public
     determine the precise number of combatant and non-combatant ,Public
     deaths given the non-permissive environments in which these ,Public
     strikes often occur. The U.S. Government remains committed to ,Public
     considering new credible information regarding non-combatant ,Public
     deaths that may emerge and revising previous assessments as ,Public
  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker if we want to have an ,Public
honest debate about the War Powers Act then let's have an honest ,Public
  Why didn't we hear anything from our colleagues on the other side of ,Public
the aisle about Libya when President Barack Obama took action that led ,Public
to the death of Muammar Qadhafi? Why not Syria? Why not Yemen? Why is ,Public
  The only reason Iran is singled out in this resolution is to take a ,Public
political jab at President Trump for utilizing an airstrike to take out ,Public
General Soleimani a terrorist who was responsible for killing ,Public
thousands of Americans partner troops and yes Iranians.,Public
  While our colleagues are upset with the use of airstrikes to kill ,Public
General Soleimani I remind them that the Obama administration ,Public
according to their own Director of National Intelligence conducted ,Public
hundreds of airstrikes averaging more than six kills a week between ,Public
January 2009 and December 2015 and that was in areas of ,Public
nonhostilities. That doesn't even include Iraq Afghanistan and Syria ,Public
  Let's just be honest about what this is. This is another partisan ,Public
attack against the President of the United States for killing General ,Public
Soleimani who was a terrorist in an area where the President had the ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may ,Public
consume to respond to the gentleman from Georgia who I have a great ,Public
  Let's be honest here. Many of us contrary to what the gentleman just ,Public
said have been outspoken against unilateral interventions by the ,Public
executive branch without notifying Congress without seeking our ,Public
approval on military authorization under Obama. I for one was ,Public
critical of his drone attacks. I raised issues about our involvement in ,Public
  I include in the Record a statement that I made saying that Congress ,Public
should reconvene and debate and vote on a resolution with regard to ,Public
       Washington DC.--For several weeks now I have been calling ,Public
     for an internationally-enforced no-fly-zone over Libya in ,Public
     order to prevent Colonel Qadaffi from slaughtering his own ,Public
     people. I agree with President Obama that U.S. ground troops ,Public
     should not be committed to this effort and that our ,Public
     international partners should soon take the lead. Whether or ,Public
     not Qadaffi remains the leader of Libya must in the end be ,Public
     up to the Libyan people. I am troubled about pressure to ,Public
     expand the military operation and the many unanswered ,Public
     questions about Libyan opposition forces. I urge the House ,Public
     leadership to call the Congress back into session as soon as ,Public
     possible so that Congress can exercise its constitutional ,Public
     responsibility to clearly spell out the mission and limits of ,Public
     U.S. military engagement in Libya. And I urge the Obama ,Public
     Administration to consult with Congress and to engage us at ,Public
     every possible opportunity as this crisis continues to ,Public
  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker some of us have been consistent on this ,Public
through Democratic and Rean administrations. I take great ,Public
exception when anybody tries to say that we are raising this issue just ,Public
  For me it is not. For me I have been consistent on this through ,Public

  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  Madam Speaker it is a little surprising that we find ourselves back ,Public
on the floor debating this resolution. After all it has already passed ,Public
both Chambers with bipartisan support. It has passed the Senate twice.,Public
  Opponents of this measure have used every trick in the book to slow ,Public
it down to try and derail it but we have reached the last page in ,Public
that book and I am confident that after we vote today this resolution ,Public
will head to the President's desk and the President will have to face ,Public
the reality that Congress is no longer going to ignore its ,Public
constitutional obligations when it comes to foreign policy and when it ,Public
comes to determining when and where our military is engaged in ,Public
  We are taking up this resolution because we see a policy from this ,Public
administration that has strayed from our values and a crisis that ,Public
demands moral leadership which is the war in Yemen.,Public
  I fully understand America's security concerns in Yemen. I appreciate ,Public
the complexities of our interests in the region. The Houthis are ,Public
trouble. They launch missiles and armed UAVs into Saudi territory and ,Public
international waters and that is a direct threat to Americans. They ,Public
are starving the Yemeni people diverting assistance and holding ,Public
  The Houthis are one of the groups Iran uses to drive instability and ,Public
gain influence. We all know what a serious threat Iran poses in the ,Public
region. The regime is the world's prolific state sponsor of terrorism ,Public
so it is important that we push back against Iran and those who depend ,Public
  But the Saudi-led coalition's response has not grappled with this ,Public
problem in a responsible way in a way designed to minimize damage to ,Public
civilians and the communities where they live and in a way that could ,Public
help bring about a political solution to this crisis.,Public
  Instead time after time after time coalition strikes have resulted ,Public
in the loss of innocent life and the violence has set off ripple ,Public
effects that have contributed to the worst humanitarian crisis in the ,Public
  Madam Speaker 85000 children have starved to death and 14 million ,Public
are on the brink of famine. More than 1 million suffer from cholera ,Public
and just last week the coalition reportedly bombed a hospital run by ,Public
  In the face of this catastrophe the administration has demanded no ,Public
accountability from the Saudis and Emiratis. But Congress won't remain ,Public
  This brings us once again to the resolution we are now considering. ,Public
This measure would specifically ban aerial refueling of warplanes ,Public
carrying out airstrikes. The Defense Department has stopped refueling ,Public
as a matter of policy. This measure would do so as a matter of law.,Public
  The Defense Department also says that the United States is not ,Public
engaged in hostilities when it comes to this war. Well the Defense ,Public
Department is entitled to its opinion but Congress is a coequal branch ,Public
of government and only we say when the United States is at war. We ,Public
don't look to the executive branch to explain the war powers that ,Public
reside in this body or for permission to exercise that power the power ,Public
  This measure is written very narrowly so it won't tie the hands of ,Public
the executive branch or set new precedents or cause unintended ,Public
consequences when it comes to our other security agreements around the ,Public
  It does nothing to expand or modify the authority provided under the ,Public
Authorization for Use of Military Force this body passed in 2001. ,Public
Instead it focuses on this particular tragedy and sends the message ,Public
that enough is enough that Congress will no longer abdicate its ,Public
responsibility when it comes to foreign policy and that we will push ,Public
to make sure our values are at the core of how the United States ,Public
  This resolution is rooted in those values: respect for human rights ,Public
for human dignity and for the belief that all people should be able to ,Public
  I hope the President understands that; and if he uses his veto pen I ,Public
hope he understands just what it is he is vetoing.,Public
  Let me thank Mr. Khanna for his hard work and leadership on the ,Public
  I also want to thank our ranking member on the Foreign Affairs ,Public
Committee Mr. McCaul. We have an honest disagreement on this one but ,Public
he has consistently and forthrightly made his case on the policy. I am ,Public
grateful to all my colleagues who have contributed so much to this ,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  Madam Speaker let me first say at the outset that the chairman and ,Public
I work very closely together. There is a recent article that said that ,Public
Chairman Eliot Engel and Ranking Member McCaul forge a rare bipartisan ,Public
bond and I think that is the way we like to conduct this committee. It ,Public
is a national security committee and it needs to be bipartisan. ,Public
However as the chairman mentioned there are times when we do have ,Public
policy differences but we do have respect in those differences.,Public
  We did take this up on the floor several weeks ago. I did oppose it ,Public
then and I oppose it for the same reasons today most importantly ,Public
because the resolution uses the war powers mechanisms to direct the ,Public
  The problem is there are no U.S. Forces to remove and the basic ,Public
premise of this resolution is that somehow we have forces in Yemen that ,Public
need to be removed that are engaged in hostilities. As the Department ,Public
has repeatedly confirmed no United States Forces are conducting ,Public
  This resolution abuses a war powers tool to get at a completely ,Public
different security assistance issue which Congress already has clear ,Public
tools to address. If Members want to condition or cut off U.S. security ,Public
assistance to Saudi Arabia then bring forward a bill to do just that.,Public
  But this resolution does nothing to address the humanitarian crisis ,Public
in Yemen. It does nothing to secure justice for the heinous murder of ,Public
Jamal Khashoggi. It does not even make real decisions on U.S. security ,Public
assistance to Saudi Arabia. The only thing it addresses clearly is the ,Public
midair refueling of coalition aircraft ended in November of 2018 ,Public
  Meanwhile this resolution stretches the definition of war powers ,Public
hostilities to cover non-U.S. military operations by other countries. ,Public
Specifically it reinterprets U.S. support to these countries as ,Public
  This radical reinterpretation has implications far beyond Saudi ,Public
Arabia. This precedent will empower any single Member to use privileged ,Public
war powers procedures to force congressional referendums that could ,Public
disrupt U.S. security cooperation agreements with more than 100 ,Public
  Just days after Israel was forced to respond to rocket attacks from ,Public
Gaza I believe this would be a dangerous precedent to legitimize this ,Public
  It could also be used to call into question our commitments to NATO ,Public
members. Let me remind my colleagues that we are celebrating NATO's ,Public
70th anniversary this week as we saw the Secretary of NATO address a ,Public
  Finally this one-sided resolution completely ignores the destructive ,Public
role of the Houthis and their backers in Tehran. The Houthis violently ,Public
overthrew the Government of Yemen. They are attacking Saudi Arabia with ,Public
weapons they got from Iran in violation of the U.N. Security Council ,Public
resolutions. They have killed Saudi civilians and endangered many ,Public
  Human Rights Watch accused the Houthis of taking hostages and ,Public
torturing detainees. The United Nations says the Houthis use civilian ,Public
human shields. The World Food Program has criticized them for illegally ,Public
stealing urgently needed food aid. The Houthis have targeted ships in ,Public
  These realities are ignored in the text of this resolution. The only ,Public
impact this resolution will have on the Houthis will be to encourage ,Public
  In addition Madam Speaker this is very important because since the ,Public
last time we debated this on the floor the Houthis engaged in a ,Public
propaganda outlet supported by Hezbollah actively touting this very ,Public
resolution online. They used our debate on the floor of the Congress to ,Public
advance their propaganda a proxy of Iran and Yemen.,Public
  This is what we are doing here today. I would submit Madam Speaker ,Public
that is very dangerous. It is dangerous and I believe it is reckless.,Public
  This will weaken the hand of the U.N. Special Envoy as well to ,Public
Yemen whose efforts currently represent the best hope we have of ,Public
bringing a negotiated end to this conflict and ending the suffering of ,Public
  So for these reasons I continue to oppose this pro-Iran pro-Houthi ,Public
resolution. I hope that my colleagues will join me in voting against ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
  Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker the blood of innocents stains this Trump ,Public
administration. And while the Trump family pals around with Saudi ,Public
murderers that blood continues to flow in the world's worst ,Public
humanitarian disaster. Only last week four years after the first Saudi ,Public
assault on Yemen they killed another group of children at a hospital ,Public
  Just as the Trump administration has aided and abetted war crimes in ,Public
Yemen this Congress has aided and abetted the Trump administration in ,Public
  Last year Reans blocked any consideration of a bipartisan ,Public
Senate resolution to stop U.S. involvement in this war. Most recently ,Public
these folks used a devious motion to recommit whose real purpose was ,Public
not the very worthy goal of condemning anti-Semitism but the sole ,Public
purpose was to obstruct this resolution and ensure it never became ,Public
  Today we must reject any such motion--no matter how worthy it may ,Public
be it can be dealt with in other legislation--in order to halt all ,Public
  We are talking about our relations with the Saudis. You know those ,Public
folks Madam Speaker. They are the ones with the leader with the bone ,Public
saw to dismember an opponent and who tortures women for asserting their ,Public
  Hearts do break for those who are lost and tortured but until we ,Public
break with the Saudis in Yemen the bombing the starvation the ,Public
  Months years hundreds of small graves ago this Congress should ,Public
have done its job. Today is a moment of moral clarity a moment for ,Public
this Chamber to act as the Constitution requires: to weigh war and ,Public
peace and for once to extract ourselves from a war we did not start ,Public
  We can finally place a clean War Powers Act resolution directly on ,Public
President Trump's desk and do so today. Let us do what is right and ,Public
let us do so before more young lives are destroyed.,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I continue to reserve the balance of my ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from ,Public
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker first of all let me thank ,Public
Chairman Engel for yielding and also for his leadership.,Public
  Also I want to just mention Congressmen Khanna Pocan and McGovern. ,Public
I want to also thank them in addition to Chairman Engel for bringing ,Public
  Madam Speaker I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 7 which of ,Public
course is a joint resolution directing the removal of U.S. Armed ,Public
  This critical resolution which we are taking now for the second time ,Public
this Congress would end America's unconstitutional participation in ,Public
  Since 2015 the United States has participated in the Saudi-led ,Public
military campaign in Yemen without authorization from Congress. We have ,Public
helped create and worsen the world's greatest and largest humanitarian ,Public
  Madam Speaker 22.2 million Yemenis--that is 75 percent of the ,Public
  At least 85000 children under the age of 5--85000--have died from ,Public
  Our involvement in this war is shameful. That is why this bipartisan ,Public
and bicameral measure to end the United States' unconstitutional role ,Public
  Yes Madam Speaker I voted against that 2001 resolution because I ,Public
knew it was open-ended and would set the stage for endless wars. It was ,Public
a blank check. We see this once again today in Yemen. We must repeal ,Public
  Over the past 18 years we have seen the executive branch use this ,Public
AUMF time and time again. It is a blank check to wage war without ,Public
  It is past time for Congress to reassert our Constitutional duty to ,Public
debate on matters of war and peace and it is past time to end this ,Public
  Madam Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and to support ,Public
this bipartisan bill to end the United States' role in Yemen.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman ,Public
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman from New York ,Public
and the gentleman from Texas. We may have some agreements because ,Public
frankly I think there is not one person on this floor in this House ,Public
and in the Senate who does not believe that there has been enormous ,Public
  I have been to Yemen. I want to go back. I know that it is if not ,Public
the poorest one of the poorest nations in the world. The children are ,Public
  If the United States should be engaged in any aspect of this let our ,Public
  I think it is important to remind my colleagues of the vicious ,Public
bombing of an innocent school bus where 40 children died and any number ,Public
of other incidences where children were involved and died.,Public
  Now these children are suffering from malnutrition and are dying ,Public
from lack of access to healthcare as well as no food. We can be a ,Public
major force the United States in providing that humanitarian aid.,Public
  But this is a resolution already passed by the other body the ,Public
Senate that indicates that if we are to be engaged in a war there ,Public
must be a debate under the Constitution about taking Americans into ,Public
war. Because the Americans who offer their sons and daughters clearly ,Public
are sacrificing. And those who put on the uniform--and we thank them--,Public
  This is a conflict between the Saudis and Houthis. It is a violence ,Public
that is going to go on and on. And if we are to prop them up--the ,Public
Saudis--they will never stop. They will never seek reconciliation. They ,Public
will never stop killing the babies because of an ``accident'' they ,Public
declared: It was a mistake. We don't know how it happened.,Public
  We cannot allow Yemeni children or any children to be in the line ,Public
  So this resolution indicates that the Congress must make a ,Public
determinative if you will assessment and engagement through the War ,Public
Powers Act and its powers to declare war under the Constitution.,Public
  Frankly I believe that this is a must-pass resolution. It must be ,Public
signed immediately and can be signed by the President of the United ,Public
States and we can begin to in an effective manner withdraw troops ,Public
and provide humanitarian aid to save the lives of children.,Public
  Madam Speaker I support the resolution and I thank the Senate for ,Public
sending it to us. We should vote on it and pass it now.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from ,Public
  Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker I thank the chairman for his ,Public
leadership on this and I really want to thank Representative Ro Khanna ,Public
for his continued steadfast efforts to end this situation.,Public
  So I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution and ,Public
finally end U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen.,Public
  If we fail to act today if we let one more opportunity to end these ,Public
horrors pass us by we are telling the world we are okay with another ,Public
day in which innocent civilians are killed; another day that nearly 20 ,Public
million people go without basic healthcare and even more in need of ,Public
emergency food aid; another day that a child must battle illnesses that ,Public
could easily have been prevented if not for this crisis happening on ,Public
  We have an opportunity as Members of this body Reans and ,Public
Democrats to tackle the difficult problems and have the debates that ,Public
others have ignored for too long. This is one of those problems. And ,Public
this is one of those moments that makes me optimistic that the tide is ,Public
  I want to thank the chairman for making this a top priority. It is ,Public
long past time for Congress to reassert its role our role in foreign ,Public
  Seeing the level of suffering in Yemen we cannot wait one more day ,Public
to do it. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman ,Public
from California (Mr. Khanna) who has been so instrumental in bringing ,Public
everyone together to make a change in policy that is much needed.,Public
  Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker I want to thank the chairman for his ,Public
leadership and his entire staff's leadership for getting us to this ,Public
point. Let me be very clear. If it weren't for Chairman Engel we would ,Public
  My motivation for this bill is very simple. I don't want to see 14 ,Public
million Yemenis starve to death. That is what Martin Griffith had said ,Public
at the U.N. that if the Saudis don't stop their blockade and let food ,Public
and medicine in within 6 months we will see one of the greatest ,Public
  That should be a bipartisan issue that this Congress speak with a ,Public
moral voice that food and medicine should get to civilians.,Public
  Now as Chairman Engel knows and others know I am not for the BDS ,Public
movement. I have supported very strongly resolutions condemning anti-,Public
Semitism. But I also don't think that these tactics should be used as ,Public
weapons to prevent efforts to stop the greatest humanitarian crisis in ,Public
  Those issues should be voted on separately and I will proudly vote ,Public
  Madam Speaker I want to with that thank again Chairman Engel ,Public
Representative McGovern Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer and ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from ,Public
  Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker I thank the gentleman for yielding and I ,Public
rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 7 invoking the War Powers ,Public
Resolution to withdraw U.S. military support for the Gulf coalition in ,Public
  For 4 years the war in Yemen has ground on killing tens of ,Public
thousands of Yemeni civilians and putting millions at imminent risk of ,Public
  The cause of the war is complicated and has much to do with Iran's ,Public
  But our interest today is not in debating the blame for the war but ,Public
in bringing it to an end. That is why I urge all Members to support ,Public
this resolution because it is in our interest and above all in the ,Public
  U.S. military support for the Saudi coalition has not prevented ,Public
civilian suffering and it is my hope that by withdrawing our support ,Public
we will make clear that a diplomatic resolution is the only resolution ,Public
  Madam Speaker I urge support for this resolution. I urge Members to ,Public
oppose any motion to commit which would have the effect of killing ,Public
this bill and prolonging the world's worst humanitarian crisis.,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  As I close I include in the Record a statement of administration ,Public
  S.J. Res. 7--Directing the President to Remove United States Armed ,Public
  Forces from Hostilities in the Re of Yemen that Have Not Been ,Public
      Authorized by Congress--Sen. Sanders I-VT and 19 cosponsors,Public
       The Administration strongly opposes passage of S.J. Res. 7 ,Public
     a joint resolution that purports to direct the President to ,Public
     remove United States forces from hostilities in or affecting ,Public
       The premise of the joint resolution is flawed. Since 2015 ,Public
     the United States has provided limited support to member ,Public
     countries of the Saudi-led coalition including intelligence ,Public
     sharing logistics support and until recently aerial ,Public
     refueling to assist in the defense of United States allies ,Public
     and partners. The provision of this support has not caused ,Public
     United States forces to be introduced into hostilities. Such ,Public
     support is provided pursuant to licenses and approvals under ,Public
     the Arms Export Control Act statutory authorities for ,Public
     Department of Defense to provide logistics support to foreign ,Public
     countries and the President's constitutional powers. Because ,Public
     the President has directed United States forces to support ,Public
     the Saudi-led coalition under his constitutional powers the ,Public
     joint resolution would raise serious constitutional concerns ,Public
     to the extent it seeks to override the President's ,Public
       In addition to its erroneous premise the joint resolution ,Public
     would harm bilateral relationships in the region negatively ,Public
     affect our ability to prevent the spread of violent extremist ,Public
     organizations--such as al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula and ,Public
     ISIS in Yemen--and establish bad precedent for future ,Public
     legislation by defining ``hostilities'' to include defense ,Public
     cooperation such as aerial refueling for purposes of this ,Public
     legislation. While we appreciate that sections 5 and 6 of the ,Public
     resolution acknowledge these serious consequences to some ,Public
     extent after-the-fact reporting is not an effective means to ,Public
     mitigate them. Our continued cooperation with regional ,Public
     partner nations allows the United States to support ,Public
     diplomatic negotiations to end the conflict promote ,Public
     humanitarian access mitigate civilian casualties enhance ,Public
     efforts to recover United States hostages in Yemen and ,Public
     defeat terrorists who seek to harm the United States.,Public
       If S.J. Res. 7 were presented to the President his senior ,Public
     advisors would recommend he veto the joint resolution.,Public
  Mr. McCAUL. Madam Speaker it really basically states yet again ,Public
that the fundamental premise of this resolution is flawed because U.S. ,Public
forces are not engaged in hostilities against the Houthis in Yemen ,Public
  If we want to cut off economic assistance or logistic assistance ,Public
security assistance to Saudi there is a way to do that but it is not ,Public
  I think it is unfortunate that we couldn't work that out but I think ,Public
we are using the wrong vehicle here. I think this confrontation abuses ,Public
the War Powers process and we need to protect the integrity of the War ,Public
  Also what worries me is the resolution stays silent on the role of ,Public
Iran. It does not condemn the Houthis who are responsible for the ,Public
killings. It tells them both to press on. It also undermines the peace ,Public
negotiations going on as I speak. The U.S. envoy is working with the ,Public
full support of the United States to negotiate a political end to this ,Public
  Getting all parties to the table has taken substantial pressure ,Public
  Again I think the fact that the Houthis are using this resolution as ,Public
propaganda to advance their cause is concerning and disturbing.,Public
  The other side cannot tell us specifically what assistance this ,Public
resolution would cut off. What I can say for sure is that this ,Public
resolution says to the Houthis and to Iran to keep going because you ,Public
  It only emboldens the rebels who violently overthrew Yemen's ,Public
government and the radical regime that backs them. That would be Iran.,Public
  So I think this resolution would set a dangerous precedent with ,Public
respect to the War Powers Act a dangerous damaging policy. Once ,Public
again Madam Speaker I urge my colleagues to vote against it and I ,Public
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker I yield myself such time as I may consume.,Public
  In closing let me say this. Everyone who knows me knows that I hold ,Public
Iran guilty to many nefarious things that are happening in that region. ,Public
This is not really about Iran. Iran is providing dangerous weapons to ,Public
the Houthis and the Houthis have starved the Yemeni people killed ,Public
civilians and diverted assistance. I am not here to defend the ,Public
  The Saudis do have legitimate concerns about the Houthis and the ,Public
Houthis are not my vision of good and righteous. Quite the opposite.,Public
  But this resolution doesn't empower Iran. Quite the opposite. The ,Public
longer the conflict goes on and the longer the United States supports ,Public
  We are really doing two things here. We are saying to the ,Public
administration--and I frankly would say this given my experience ,Public
over the past two decades--to any administration. There is no blank ,Public
check for war. We have abrogated our responsibility in the years that I ,Public
have been here--and I am as guilty as anyone--by allowing ,Public
administration after administration after administration to conduct ,Public
  Only Congress can declare war. And if we ignore what is happening ,Public
with the civilian population in this war with the Houthis then we do ,Public
so at our own peril. We then say that because Saudi Arabia does have ,Public
legitimate concerns--and they do--we are giving them a blank check to ,Public
  No blank checks anymore. No blank checks to say the administration ,Public
can run wars without getting the approval of Congress. And no blank ,Public
checks to indiscriminately bomb and have innocent civilians and ,Public
schoolchildren in buses be killed and people starving in a ,Public
  We can't just sit back and say: ``Well you know we have ,Public
difficulties with Iran so we are going to look the other way.'' I have ,Public
lots of difficulties with Iran but we can't look the other way when ,Public
people are starving or when people are being killed. That is what we ,Public
  So we are doing two things. We are saying no more war in which we are ,Public
complicit where a population is wholesale starving. We are also saying ,Public
that this body is not giving a blank check to every administration. And ,Public
I would be doing this no matter who the President of the United States ,Public
  We need to reclaim our authority. We have fought in war after war ,Public
after war. As everyone knows we haven't declared war since before all ,Public
of us were born since December 71941 when President Roosevelt stood ,Public
up right here and declared war. That was the last time.,Public
  I hope this will be the start of Congress taking back its ,Public
constitutional power not for the sake of having a fight with the ,Public
executive branch but for the sake of doing what we are supposed to do.,Public
  Congress has the power to declare war. Congress has the power to say ,Public
what we do when it comes to war. We are taking that back today. We are ,Public
saying that America will not be complicit in the wholesale beating down ,Public
of civilian populations and looking the other way.,Public
  Let me say that again. Iran has fueled this conflict through its ,Public
support for the Houthis but the longer this conflict rages the better ,Public
it is for Iran. Iran thrives on every misstep of the Saudi-led ,Public
coalition. A vote for this resolution is a vote to end the United ,Public
States' involvement in this war a war which helps Iran.,Public
  Let me say again for Congress this is an important step in ,Public
reclaiming our role in foreign policy by debating where and when the ,Public
United States military is engaged abroad. With the humanitarian crisis ,Public
in Yemen it is critical that we act now. I urge my colleagues to join ,Public
  Before I yield back I want to again tell Mr. McCaul that we don't ,Public
always agree on things. I think we agree on things more than we don't. ,Public
But I do appreciate his earnest attempts with me to try to make foreign ,Public
policy as bipartisan as we can. I think that is what we need to do.,Public
  We need to show unity in strength. In unity there is strength. We ,Public
are all Americans. We may disagree from time to time but I think we ,Public
are not going to be disagreeable. So I thank Mr. McCaul.,Public
  Madam Speaker I yield back the balance of my time.,Public
  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker I rise today in strong support of ,Public
S.J. Res. 7 which directs the removal of United States Armed Forces ,Public
from hostilities in the Re of Yemen that have not been authorized ,Public
  The passage of S.J. Res. 7 would mark the first time in the 45 years ,Public
since the enactment of the War Powers Act that the House of ,Public
Representatives successfully invoked the statute's removal mechanism to ,Public
compel the Executive Branch to remove American troops from harm's way.,Public
  I support this resolution because Congress has the sole power to ,Public
declare war under Article I Section 8 Clause 11 of the United States ,Public
  Madam Speaker Congress has not declared war with respect to or ,Public
provided a specific statutory authorization for the conflict between ,Public
military forces led by Saudi Arabia including forces from the United ,Public
Arab Emirates Bahrain Kuwait Egypt Jordan Morocco Senegal and ,Public
Sudan (the Saudi-led coalition) against the Houthis also known as ,Public
  Since March 2015 members of the United States Armed Forces have been ,Public
introduced into hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the ,Public
Houthis including providing to the Saudi-led coalition aerial ,Public
targeting assistance intelligence sharing and mid-flight aerial ,Public
  The United States has established a Joint Combined Planning Cell with ,Public
Saudi Arabia in which members of the United States Armed Forces assist ,Public
in aerial targeting and help to coordinate military and intelligence ,Public
  Madam Speaker the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and the ,Public
Houthis constitutes within the meaning of Section 4(a) of the War ,Public
Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)) either hostilities or a ,Public
situation where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly ,Public
indicated by the circumstances into which United States Armed Forces ,Public
  Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states ,Public
that ``at any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in ,Public
hostilities outside the territory of the United States its possessions ,Public
and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory ,Public
authorization such forces shall be removed by the President if the ,Public
  Most importantly no specific statutory authorization for the use of ,Public
Forces with respect to the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and ,Public
  Also no provision of law explicitly authorizes the provision of ,Public
targeting assistance or of midair refueling services to warplanes of ,Public
Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates that are engaged in such ,Public
  For this reason the resolution directs that the President remove ,Public
United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the ,Public
Re of Yemen except United States Armed Forces engaged in ,Public
operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces by not later than ,Public
the date that is 30 days after the date of the enactment.,Public
  The resolution makes clear that the term ``hostilities'' includes in-,Public
flight refueling non-United States aircraft conducting missions as ,Public
  Madam Speaker Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world ,Public
right now. The Yemen crisis began in the Arab Spring of 2011 when an ,Public
uprising forced the country's long-time authoritarian president Ali ,Public
Abdullah Saleh to hand over power to his deputy Abdrabbuh Mansour ,Public
  Since 2015 Saudi Arabia has launched an estimated 18000 air strikes ,Public
on Yemen attacking hospitals schools water treatment plants ,Public
  The Saudis also imposed a blockade on food fuel and medicine from ,Public
freely entering the country in what can only be described as a ,Public
deliberate effort to starve the civilian population into submission.,Public
  More than 14 million Yemenis are steps away from starvation and at ,Public
least 85000 children under the age of five have perished from war-,Public
  The United States has supported the Saudi led air campaign with mid-,Public
air refueling support intelligence and targeting assistance and other ,Public
  Yemen is experiencing the world's worst famine in 100 years with 12 ,Public
million to 13 million innocent civilians at risk of dying from the lack ,Public

RELATING TO A NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED BY THE PRESIDENT ON FEBRUARY ,Public
  On Wednesday September 252019 the Senate passed S.J. Res. 54 as ,Public
       Whereas Congress has the sole power to declare war under ,Public
     article I section 8 clause 11 of the United States ,Public
       Whereas Congress has not declared war with respect to or ,Public
     provided a specific statutory authorization for the conflict ,Public
     between military forces led by Saudi Arabia including forces ,Public

     coalition) against the Houthis also known as Ansar Allah ,Public
       Whereas since March 2015 members of the United States ,Public
     Armed Forces have been introduced into hostilities between ,Public
     the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis including providing ,Public
     to the Saudi-led coalition aerial targeting assistance ,Public
     intelligence sharing and mid-flight aerial refueling;,Public
       Whereas the United States has established a Joint Combined ,Public
     Planning Cell with Saudi Arabia in which members of the ,Public
     United States Armed Forces assist in aerial targeting and ,Public
     help to coordinate military and intelligence activities;,Public
       Whereas in December 2017 Secretary of Defense James N. ,Public

      SUPPORT OF H.R. 2500 THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT,Public
  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Speaker last Friday I voted in support of H.R. ,Public
2500 the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year ,Public
  While I have consistently opposed this legislation in previous years ,Public
and still have concerns about a number of provisions included in this ,Public
year's legislation--including yet another spending increase to an ,Public
already bloated Pentagon budget--this legislation also contains ,Public
numerous policy priorities that I strongly support and which have not ,Public
  First this legislation grants our men and women in uniform a well-,Public
deserved pay raise of 3.1 percent--the largest pay raise for our troops ,Public
since the last Democratic House majority in 2010. Those who serve in ,Public
uniform continue to make extraordinary sacrifices for our country and ,Public
the very least we can do is grant them a pay raise.,Public
  I am pleased that this legislation also includes numerous provisions ,Public
that require the Department of Defense (DoD) to address the existential ,Public
threat of climate change including updating military construction ,Public
standards to promote energy and climate resilience. It also requires ,Public
DoD to report on its progress towards meeting the goal of 25 percent ,Public
  Additionally I am pleased that this legislation prevents the ,Public
president from diverting defense funding to pay for an unnecessary ,Public
border wall prohibits funding for the deployment of dangerous low-,Public
yield nuclear weapons nullifies President Trump's discriminatory ,Public
military transgender ban and helps protect our veterans from being ,Public
taken advantage of by predatory for-profit colleges. Moreover it ends ,Public
the unfair Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP)/Indemnity Compensation (DIC) ,Public
offset--also known as the ``widow's tax''--which currently reduces ,Public
spouse survivor benefits by an average of $1250 per month. I am also ,Public
strongly supportive of the inclusion of twelve weeks of paid family and ,Public
  This legislation also includes several provisions to strengthen our ,Public
national security including requiring the DoD to enhance our election ,Public
security countering Russian aggression and election interference ,Public
enhancing security cooperation with our allies in Europe and Asia and ,Public
protecting against the increasing risk of cyber attacks.,Public
  I have always advocated for strengthening Congress's constitutional ,Public
authority to declare war and limiting the president's authority to ,Public
engage in armed conflict without the consent of Congress. That's why I ,Public
voted in support of amendments to prevent the president from using ,Public
unauthorized force against Iran to prohibit U.S. support to and ,Public
participation in the Saudi-led coalition's military operations in ,Public
Yemen and to repeal the long-outdated 2002 authorization for the use ,Public
of military force (AUMF) in Iraq. I am proud that these amendments ,Public
  This year I have once again introduced legislation to amend the War ,Public
of 1973 and reassert Congress's constitutional war powers. I have also ,Public
consistently supported legislation to repeal the 2001 AUMF which the ,Public
Pentagon uses to continue to justify the 18 years our troops have been ,Public
fighting in the Middle East. President Trump has sent troops to Syria ,Public
Yemen and elsewhere without seeking a new AUMF which in my view is a ,Public
  Furthermore I am pleased that this legislation accelerates closure ,Public
of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility by prohibiting new detainees ,Public
and allowing transfer of detainees to secure facilities in the United ,Public
States. This unnecessary facility costs almost $450 million each year ,Public
to house 40 prisoners and has been used as a top recruiting tool by ,Public
terrorists. The prison at Guantanamo Bay has been a black eye for the ,Public
United States eroding relationships with our allies undermining U.S. ,Public
missions abroad and putting U.S. citizens and our troops at risk of ,Public
  However I believe this legislation could have made responsible cuts ,Public
to our defense budget without jeopardizing the safety of our troops or ,Public
undermining our national security. For years Congress has continued to ,Public
increase the Pentagon's budget despite overwhelming evidence of its ,Public
waste and abuse of taxpayer money. This year's legislation--with its ,Public
outrageous top line defense budget of $733 billion--is yet another ,Public
example of Congress's habit of increasing the defense budget every ,Public
  I have long supported a financial audit of the Pentagon. Unlike every ,Public
other federal agency the DoD has yet to pass a financial audit. In ,Public
Nov-18 the Pentagon spectacularly failed its first full audit ,Public
which highlighted numerous examples of waste and abuse. While I am ,Public
pleased that this year's NDAA requires an annual audit of the DoD in ,Public
order to help identify waste it is ridiculous to provide the Pentagon ,Public
a massive spending increase--as this bill does--when the Pentagon ,Public
cannot even account for how it spends taxpayer money.,Public
  In particular I have always opposed the DoD's Overseas Contingency ,Public
Operation (OCO) account a fiscally irresponsible fund that is not ,Public
counted in the budget recklessly adds to our mounting debt and has no ,Public
congressional oversight. OCO is a Pentagon slush fund that gives a ,Public
blank check to fund endless wars that Congress hasn't authorized. ,Public
That's why I co-led an amendment to cut OCO funding in the bill by ,Public
approximately 25 percent. I am disappointed that this amendment failed ,Public
  The bottom line is that fiscal responsibility and accountability at ,Public
the Pentagon would allow for funds to be better spent supporting the ,Public
needs of our troops meeting our obligations to veterans and ensuring ,Public
our legitimate defense needs are prioritized. I strongly encourage my ,Public
Senate colleagues to keep the strong provisions included in the House ,Public

Taliban in the wake of 9/11 in what became the largest armed conflict ,Public
in American history. In 2002 Congress authorized the invasion of Iraq ,Public
and it became the greatest foreign policy mistake of a generation.,Public
  And our response has been silence silence from this collective body; ,Public
silence as we have sent hundreds of thousands of American men and women ,Public
to Afghanistan and tens of thousands more to Iraq; silence as three ,Public

  The vote today on the War Powers Resolution to restrict the current ,Public

necessary response to a reckless President without a plan. But it is ,Public
not enough because yesterday this administration told us that the ,Public
legal authority to launch a strike targeting Iran 6 days ago was ,Public
granted based on the authority that this body allowed to invade Iraq 18 ,Public
years ago using a deceased dictator to justify a potential war against ,Public
an entirely different adversary making a mockery of matters of war and ,Public
  So now facing the threat of war with a different yet brutal regime ,Public
this body must finally act to cut off any avenue that this President or ,Public
any other President has to enter our people into a war that we do not ,Public
want because this isn't just about the actions of a current ,Public
administration. It is about the precedent that we set from this day ,Public
  We must pass a War Powers Resolution today. We must repeal the 2001 ,Public
and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force. We must compel the ,Public
executive branch to come to Congress and make the case that any ,Public
military action that is required to protect American lives is in our ,Public

  Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President today I wish to discuss Senate amendment ,Public
  The author of the amendment Senator Romney and others have made ,Public
clear that this language does not constitute an authorization of the ,Public
use of military force or AUMF. I agree with that assessment.,Public
  While this amendment appears to restate existing Presidential ,Public
authority to defend the country in the event of an attack it includes ,Public
other language that could be interpreted to provide more authority to ,Public
the President. That concerns me which is why I voted against this ,Public
  Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President amendment No. 861 fully captures the ,Public
utter failure of the modern Congress to assert and defend congressional ,Public
war powers that the U.S. Constitution solely vests in the legislative ,Public
branch. It treats matters of life and death as mere fodder for ,Public
votes and represents an approach to legislating that is ultimately as ,Public
  If one asked 10 attorneys to analyze the text of amendment No. 861 ,Public
one might very well receive 10 wildly different interpretations of what ,Public
the undefined terms in the amendment mean from the use of the term ,Public
``attack by the government military forces or proxies of a foreign ,Public
nation or by other hostile forces'' to the phrase ``used to ensure the ,Public
ability of the Armed Forces of the United States to defend themselves ,Public
  As the authors plausibly argue the intent of the amendment may very ,Public
well be to simply reaffirm existing legal interpretations and norms ,Public
that authorize the U.S. Armed Forces to defend itself and our citizens ,Public
against attack by a foreign nation or other hostile force. As ,Public
supporters argue the amendment language avoids using the specific ,Public
phrase ``authorization for use of military force'' and thus one may ,Public
  Yet adopting such an interpretation requires ignoring years of ,Public
executive branch overreach when it comes to taking unilateral military ,Public
action without seeking an authorization for use of military force or a ,Public
  It requires willfully forgetting the behavior of our current ,Public
President and past Presidents of both parties who have chosen to ,Public
define the concept of Commander in Chief under Article II of the U.S. ,Public
Constitution to be less a commander and more an emperor while the ,Public
legislative branch has sat idly by as its war powers were rapidly ,Public
  Congress is a coequal branch of government. It is time we started ,Public
acting like it. We cannot trust any President to take a blank check and ,Public
fill in a reasonable number. I must oppose amendment 861 because in my ,Public
reading any President of any party would adopt the broadest legal ,Public
interpretation possible in defining what constitutes an ``other hostile ,Public
force'' or an ``attack'' or what it means to ``ensure the ability of ,Public
the Armed Forces of the U.S. to defend themselves.'',Public
  This language risks unintentionally authorizing President Trump to ,Public
order all types of military strikes against any number of potential ,Public
entities that the President deems to be a threat. How would the Trump ,Public
administration determine the precise baseline that defines the term ,Public
``ability'' of the military to defend itself? Would allowing the ,Public
degradation of any platform or capability qualify as failing to ,Public
``ensure the ability'' of the U.S. Armed Forces to defend itself? If ,Public
so that would authorize the use of funds in the National Defense ,Public
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 to take unilateral preemptive ,Public
action again a foreign nation or hostile force to preserve the current ,Public
  I am confident the author of this amendment would disagree with this ,Public
interpretation of his legislative language. However would the sponsor ,Public
argue that such an interpretation is unreasonable or not possible? ,Public
Would a Federal Court not defer to the Federal Agency's interpretation ,Public
of a vague and ambiguous statute? I do not know the answer to either ,Public
question; yet I know this: I am not willing to take that risk.,Public
  We are living with the consequences of a previous Congress that ,Public
rushed to pass a concise authorization for use of military force that ,Public
appeared targeted and limited at first. We have watched as Rean ,Public
and Democratic administrations alike subsequently employed creative and ,Public
broad legal interpretations of that authorization to continually expand ,Public
which parties were connected with the horrific terrorist attacks of ,Public
  To this very day the Trump administration cites this authorization ,Public
for use of military force as legal justification to unilaterally deploy ,Public
Americans all around the world even though it was authorized in ,Public
response to an event that took place before some of these troops were ,Public
even born. To be clear I am not asserting that I oppose the premise or ,Public

  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President killings of environmental defenders are ,Public
shockingly common in Latin America Africa and Asia. The assassination ,Public
of Berta Caceres in Honduras 3 years ago orchestrated by top officials ,Public
of a hydroelectric company and carried out by retired and Active-Duty ,Public
soldiers who had received training from the United States was ,Public
emblematic of the widespread use of harassment threats and murder to ,Public
silence those who courageously call for changes in policies and ,Public
  According to a report released today by Global Witness the ,Public
Philippines has the highest number of killings in Asia of people who ,Public
oppose illegal logging destructive mining and corrupt agribusiness ,Public
with at least 30 cases documented in 2018. The total number is likely ,Public
higher as some investigations are ongoing. Many of the victims simply ,Public
wanted a say in how their land and the country's natural resources are ,Public
used. The perpetrators are almost never arrested or prosecuted.,Public
  On July 25 2016 the Philippines' newly elected President Rodrigo ,Public
Duterte delivered his first state of the nation address. He promised to ,Public
safeguard the country's rural and indigenous communities tackle ,Public
corruption and protect the environment. The results since then paint a ,Public
very different and distressing picture. If President Duterte meant what ,Public
he said he has failed miserably. According to Global Witness in the 3 ,Public
years before Duterte took office at least 65 land and environmental ,Public
defenders were murdered. That was appalling enough. But in the 3 years ,Public
since he came to power that number rose to 113. At least 31 of those ,Public
murders were reportedly committed by the Philippine Armed Forces whose ,Public
soldiers and officers act with near total impunity.,Public
  The Philippines is a major recipient of U.S. military aid and we are ,Public
perceived by the families of the victims to be enablers of these ,Public
crimes. In addition to increasing support for local environmental ,Public
defenders the Secretary of State and Administrator of the U.S. Agency ,Public
for International Development should urge the Duterte government to ,Public
ensure that the right to free prior and informed consent of those ,Public
impacted by policies and practices that threaten their land and natural ,Public
resources is respected. This is necessary not only to prevent the ,Public
destruction of forests and farms the pollution of watersheds and the ,Public
extinction of species but to avoid confrontations and violence that ,Public
result when extractive industries supported by the Armed Forces and ,Public
  The Secretaries of State and Defense should also ensure that those in ,Public
the Philippine Armed Forces who receive our aid respect the rights of ,Public
civilians and are accountable to the rule of law. When abuses occur ,Public
they should be thoroughly investigated and the individuals responsible ,Public
brought to justice. The Leahy Laws require that and it is the ,Public
responsibility of U.S. officials to ensure that they are enforced.,Public
