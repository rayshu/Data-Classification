" Mark Ring, Ph.D.
Dr. Ring's research revolves around a single focus: Continual Learning in Artificial Intelligence, which tries to answer one question: If you can give an agent a single algorithm at its inception and then stand back and let it learn all on its own, what do you put into that algorithm to allow the agent to continue to learn, develop and improve forever? How should an artificial agent begin the unending process of learning and development, so that it is constantly improving its ability to comprehend and interact with the world? His 1994 dissertation, Continual Learning in Reinforcement Environments, explored this and related issues in depth. Although many ideas discussed in the dissertation have more recently fallen into favor, at the time of their publication, much of the work was far from the beaten path.

There are many potential mechanisms for artificial continual learning, but the first one he developed was called the Temporal Transition Hierarchies (TTH) algorithm, which intelligently and incrementally extended an agent's memory to help it resolve contradictions. More recent work has focused on organizing behaviors according to their similarities (using the ""Motmap"") and making predictions about long-term behaviors (Forecasts).

" Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. (“Sumitomo Electric”) and Sony Corporation (“Sony”) have successfully developed the world’s first*1 semiconductor laser diode with an optical output power of over 100 mW in the true green region at a wavelength of 530 nm. This laser diode can be mounted on laser projectors and many other display devices. The new laser diode features twice the luminosity*2 compared with conventional gallium nitride (GaN) green laser diodes, and a color gamut broadened by 182% based on the NTSC standard (CIE 1976 color gamut)*3. As a result, these significantly improve the performance of laser projectors and other display devices to reproduce vibrant video and images.

Red and blue laser diodes have been commercially available among the primary red-green-blue (RGB) colors, but there has been greater need for high output green laser diodes towards the development of high performance laser projectors and display devices. Currently, green lasers are generated by converting the wavelength of infrared laser light from a light source using optical materials, but the light source is large and expensive. In addition, conventional GaN-based green lasers have difficulties achieving sufficient luminosity as their performance is limited to an output power of several tens of milliwatt at a wavelength of 520 nm or less.

To overcome these challenges, Sumitomo Electric and Sony collaborated in the development of a true green semiconductor laser for practical use, drawing on Sumitomo Electric’s semi-polar GaN substrate, crystal growth, and wafer processing technologies, as well as Sony’s GaN-based laser technology, acquired through the Blu-ray development. By introducing new techniques and improving the entire semiconductor laser production process, including structural design, crystal growth, wafer processing, and electrode configuration, Sumitomo Electric and Sony were able to successfully develop true green semiconductor laser with an optical output power of more than 100 mW at a wavelength of 530 nm. This true green semiconductor laser diode is highly reliable as it realizes wall-plug efficiency of over 8%.

The development of true green semiconductor laser diode completes the three basic colors of the RGB laser light sources. Sumitomo Electric and Sony anticipate a wide variety of applications for this technology such as incorporation into advanced laser projectors with high luminosity and broad color gamut, as well as compact, light, energy-efficient laser projectors.

Sumitomo Electric and Sony will continue to jointly develop true green semiconductor laser diode to achieve even higher output power, efficiency, and laser quality.

" Sony’s F65 CineAlta camera delivers 4K image resolution—the highest resolution currently available in the digital motion picture production industry. Last autumn, Sony announced that the camera’s SRMASTER recording formats (F65RAW files and 2K/HD MPEG-4 Simple Studio Profile) would be promoted to the market as an open platform. Since that time, Sony has worked to gain the industry’s broaden support for these formats by providing technical specifications and development assistance to content production equipment manufacturers.

As a result, in February, six makers of nonlinear editing system and color grading solutions launched new product releases with full support for the SRMASTER format. Ten major Hollywood post-production companies are also moving forward with their support in their facilities to accommodate F65 shot projects.

Today, as a proof of broader acceptance by the industry, another six partner companies have implemented SRMASTER format support in their products for on-set dailies, nonlinear editing, color grading, ingesting (into the post-production pipeline), and compositing.

With support already provided by multiple of such partner companies, movie makers are given a tool and environment to enjoy flawless 4K content production workflow.

To further evolve the efficiency of SRMASTER workflows, Sony has also developed technology to enable high-speed transfer of SRMASTER high-definition image file through ordinary coaxial cable interface (3G-SDI). This new “SRExpress” interface, which can transfer files 5 times faster than real time,1 will be enabled by Sony’s SR-R1 SRMASTER portable recorder in May.",Public
" Sharp Corporation (“Sharp”) and Sony Corporation (“Sony”) announced that they have agreed to further amend the joint venture agreement originally executed by the parties in July 2009, as amended in April 2011, for the establishment and operation of Sharp Display Products Corporation (“SDP”), a joint venture to produce and sell large-sized LCD panels and modules.

Pursuant to the April 2011 amendment, Sharp and Sony discussed possible further contributions by Sony to SDP, but they have agreed that Sony will not make additional capital injections to SDP. The parties have also agreed to set a new time period, up to the end of September 2012, to permit study of the future direction of the joint venture, including with respect to the treatment of the shares that Sony has in SDP (7.04% of all issued shares) and possible purchases of large-sized LCD panels and modules. Under the March 2012 amendment, Sony may require that Sharp acquire all of Sony's shares in SDP, even before the end of September 2012, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a transfer by Sharp to any third party of some or all of the shares that Sharp has in SDP.

On July 1, 2009, Sharp transferred its LCD panel plant in Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture, to SDP. On December 29, 2009, Sony invested 10 billion yen into SDP in exchange for new shares issued by SDP to Sony (representing 7.04% of the issued shares in SDP) and, as a result, SDP became a joint venture company of Sharp and Sony. Since then, Sharp and Sony have continued discussion about possible further contributions by Sony to SDP.

" Specifically, Sony provided a high-definition (HD) video projector boasting a 7,000 lumen brightness, 150-inch screen, and professional switchers that are easy to carry and operate, to show movies and music videos, along with educational content, to the public at outdoor sites. Combining Sony entertainment content with educational footage and lectures about the prevention of HIV, Sony and its partners produced a diverse program that exceeded expectations on all fronts. Among the 4,700 participants, 2,482 people took the HIV test, far beyond event forecasts. In addition, the inclusion of entertainment content helped attract the younger generations to whom AMREF’s education programs are primarily targeted.

“Early receipt of proper HIV testing and counselling is not only vital for preventing infections, but is also effective for preventing the spread of diseases,” said Christoph Benn, Director of External Relations and Partnerships, the Global Fund. “We were glad to have had this opportunity to work with Sony on this important endeavour, and are hoping for prompt execution of the same sort of program in other countries (outside Tanzania), with assistance from the Global Fund.”

Shiro Kambe, Corporate Executive and Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and CSR, Sony Corporation, said, ""Sony is continuing its ongoing efforts to contribute to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Participation in the ‘Public Viewing in Tanzania’ program, which we launched in collaboration with the Global Fund and AMREF, exceeded our expectations, and we are confident that the program has made a lasting contribution to education in Tanzania on the important issue of disease prevention. Sony plans to conduct similar programs in various countries and regions, to lay the foundations for local people to operate such programs independently, and contribute to capacity building in local communities in the future. Going forward, Sony will maintain its unwavering commitment to fulfilling its corporate social responsibility, and continue to support various activities to address social issues around the world.”

Sony donated the audio visual equipment used in the program to AMREF upon the completion of the project so that AMREF may use it at similar events in the future aimed at the prevention of HIV and other infectious diseases. In addition, Sony's technical team trained members of AMREF staff on how to operate the equipment.

In advance of the program, Sony recruited student interns in Japan for the first time in its CSR project history. Two student interns were selected to travel to Tanzania as part of the project team, providing on-site support and engaging in work such as planning the show schedule, installing and removing equipment, and documenting the events on video. In light of the growing importance of emerging markets in Sony’s business, Sony also invited three young employees to take part in the project to enable them to acquire hands-on experience in both urban and rural parts of Tanzania.",Public

" Sony Corporation (“Sony”) and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (“Ericsson”) today announced that Sony will acquire Ericsson’s 50 percent stake in Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications AB (“Sony Ericsson”), making the mobile handset business a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony.

The transaction gives Sony an opportunity to rapidly integrate smartphones into its broad array of network-connected consumer electronics devices – including tablets, televisions and personal computers - for the benefit of consumers and the growth of its business. The transaction also provides Sony with a broad intellectual property (IP) cross-licensing agreement covering all products and services of Sony as well as ownership of five essential patent families relating to wireless handset technology.

As part of the transaction, Ericsson will receive a cash consideration of EUR 1.05 billion.

During the past ten years the mobile market has shifted focus from simple mobile phones to rich smartphones that include access to internet services and content. The transaction is a logical strategic step that takes into account the nature of this evolution and its impact on the marketplace.

This means that the synergies for Ericsson in having both a world leading technology and telecoms services portfolio and a handset operation are decreasing. Today Ericsson’s focus is on the global wireless market as a whole; how wireless connectivity can benefit people, business and society beyond just phones. Consistent with that mission, by setting up a wireless connectivity initiative, Ericsson and Sony will work to drive and develop the market’s adoption of connectivity across multiple platforms.

“This acquisition makes sense for Sony and Ericsson, and it will make the difference for consumers, who want to connect with content wherever they are, whenever they want. With a vibrant smartphone business and by gaining access to important strategic IP, notably a broad cross-license agreement, our four-screen strategy is in place. We can more rapidly and more widely offer consumers smartphones, laptops, tablets and televisions that seamlessly connect with one another and open up new worlds of online entertainment. This includes Sony’s own acclaimed network services, like the PlayStation Network and Sony Entertainment Network,” said Sir Howard Stringer, Sony’s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr. Stringer also noted that the acquisition will afford Sony operational efficiencies in engineering, network development and marketing, among other areas. “We can help people enjoy all our content – from movies to music and games – through our many devices, in a way no one else can.”

“Ten years ago when we formed the joint venture, thereby combining Sony’s consumer products knowledge with Ericsson’s telecommunication technology expertise, it was a perfect match to drive the development of feature phones. Today we take an equally logical step as Sony acquires our stake in Sony Ericsson and makes it a part of its broad range of consumer devices. We will now enhance our focus on enabling connectivity for all devices, using our R&D and industry leading patent portfolio to realize a truly connected world” said Hans Vestberg, President and CEO of Ericsson.

When Sony Ericsson started its operations on October 1, 2001, it combined the unprofitable handset operations from Ericsson and Sony. Following a successful turnaround the company has become a market leader in the development of feature phones by integrating Sony’s strong consumer products knowledge and Ericsson’s telecommunications technology leadership. The Walkman™ phone and Cyber-shot™ phone are well known examples.

With the successful introduction of the P1 in 2007, Sony Ericsson early on established itself in the smartphone segment. More recently, the company has successfully made the transition from feature phones to Android-based Xperia™ smartphones. By the end of the third quarter of 2011, Sony Ericsson held a market share of 11 percent (by value) in the Android phone market, representing 80 percent of the company’s third quarter sales. During its ten years in operation Sony Ericsson has generated approximately EUR 1.5 billion of profit and paid dividends totaling approximately EUR 1.9 billion to its parent companies. Prominent models include “Xperia™ arc” and “Xperia™ mini” which received 2011 EISA Awards, while recent notable additions to the lineup include “Xperia™ PLAY” and “Xperia™ arc S”.

The transaction, which has been approved by appropriate decision-making bodies of both companies, is expected to close in January 2012, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

As a result of obtaining full control of Sony Ericsson, Sony will consolidate Sony Ericsson from the closing date of the acquisition. The resulting impact of the acquisition to Sony’s consolidated results for the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2012 is currently being evaluated.

" First cooperation in the security industry to establish a global open standard for the interface of network video products Interoperability between different vendors' products will simplify installation of network video products regardless of brand Greater freedom for end-users when choosing equipment, resulting in more cost-effective and flexible solutions Creation of an open forum for further development of the new standard

Axis Communications, Bosch Security Systems and Sony Corporation announce that they will be cooperating to create an open forum aimed at developing a standard for the interface of network video products. Currently, there is no global standard defining how network video products such as cameras, video encoders and video management systems should communicate with each other. The new standard is expected to comprise interfaces for specifications such as video streaming, device discovery, intelligence metadata, etc. The framework of the standard, incorporating the key elements of network video product interoperability, will be released in October 2008 at the Security show in Essen, Germany.

The main goal of this new standard is to facilitate the integration of various brands of network video equipment and to help manufacturers, software developers and independent software vendors ensure product interoperability. A unified open standard will also offer end-users greater flexibility of choice, enabling them to select products from different vendors in order to develop systems that fully meet their needs. This standardization initiative demonstrates the strong commitment of Axis, Bosch and Sony to supporting the ongoing shift from analog to digital surveillance in the security market.

A forum set up by the said three companies will be open for all companies and interest groups who would like to participate in the standardization work. The forum will be established in the fourth quarter of 2008, and will work on further development of the standard and on reaching agreement on how the new technology should be implemented.

""We are very pleased to announce this cooperation between our companies,"" says Ray Mauritsson, President of Axis Communications. ""An open standard will make it even easier for integrators and end-users to benefit from the many possibilities offered by IP-based video surveillance technology.""
""This cooperation represents a great leap forward in establishing an international open forum focusing on network video surveillance,"" says Gert van Iperen, Executive Vice President at Bosch.

" Tokyo -- Toshiba Corporation, Sony Corporation and NEC Electronics Corporation today announced the successful co-development of an LSI mass production platform for next-generation 45 nanometer (nm) process technology. The new platform integrates elemental breakthroughs with cutting-edge technologies to achieve a highly efficient process for production of high performance system LSI. This technology was unveiled on December 13 (US Pacific Standard Time) at Session 27.2 of the 2006 International Electron Devices Meeting (IEDM) in San Francisco, CA.

The key elements of the new platform are a fully renovated MOSFET integration scheme, and a hybrid structure with a low dielectric constant (low-k) film that assures high performance and reliability.

The MOSFET integration process applies strained silicon technology to the transistor, utilizing crystal lattice distortion to induce performance-boosting local strain at key locations. Optimization of the strain boosts transistor performance to a level 30% faster than that achieved in the present generation of technology.

Application of a low-k film in the intermediate metal layer of the chip during the back-end process reduces parasitic capacitance and improves circuit performance. The three partners confirmed a dielectric gate film with an effective 15-year lifetime, a span surpassing the average lifetime of a high performance LSI. They also carried out exhaustive tests of the platform and proved a layer yield of over 98% for the challenging back-end process, confirming that the technology achieves the reliability essential for mass production.

In addition, the partners have led the industry in applying immersion lithography technology with an ultra-high numerical aperture (NA) of over 1.0 to formation of the transistor node, achieving a cell with an area of 0.248 micron m² in an ultra high density SRAM. The new cell is the smallest yet achieved.

The three companies are simultaneously developing two 45nm processes -- the current platform, which is ideal for high performance LSIs, as well as a platform for applications with low power consumption requirements, which is expected to be completed in early 2007.",Public

" On July 24th, Sony announced in Beijing a new initiative, Sony Student Project Abroad (China), inviting high school students from China to visit Japan and learn about Japanese culture and society via a program that includes visiting Japanese enterprises and schools and staying in Japanese homes. This first delegation from China will visit Japan from July 26th through August 2nd, 2006.

The year 2006 marks the 10th anniversary of Sony (China) Limited and the 60th anniversary of Sony Corporation as well. Sony Corporation and Sony (China) Limited decided to jointly launch this significant social contribution initiative as part of initiatives to commemorate this important year. In selecting the first delegation, Sony has asked the China Youth Association for their support in inviting 10 students from Beijing and another 10 students from Shanghai.

The theme during their stay in Japan will be ""Environment,"" a topic which is coming under increased focus in China. Sony will provide opportunities for these students to interact with Japanese high school students, participate in dialogue with Sony’s multinational employees, enjoy a home-stay experience by living in the homes of Sony employees, and visit Sony-related facilities (such as recycling facilities) as part of various scheduled events and activities.

Sony’s CEO, Sir Howard Stringer, has sent a congratulatory letter to the participants stating that:""Since this program’s inception in 1990 and after hosting 500 students form the US, this will be the first year for the program to welcome bright, young students from China, and we hope to continue this unique program for many years to come.""

""I strongly hope that these students will take full advantage of this opportunity to get more information and understanding of Japanese culture, Sony’s unique value and people’s common concern for the environment. ""The most important part is communication from the heart, from person to person"", said Mr. Shizuo Takashino, Sony’s Executive Vice President and Chairman of Sony (China) Limited at the press conference in Beijing.

Sony aims to contribute to the promotion of mutual understanding between Japan and China for future generations by providing promising Chinese high school students opportunities to experience Japanese culture, society, lifestyle and customs.",Public
" This joint demonstration at GLOBALCOMM will show how this combination of technologies empowers end users to use their mobile phones to communicate with their home environment.

At the demonstration, users will be able to wirelessly view digital photos stored in their mobile phones on a living room TV, to use a home gateway for instant messaging between mobile phones outside the home and a living room TV, and be able to access the content stored on their home PC via mobile phones.

Claes Ödman, Vice President, Multimedia Solutions, Ericsson, says: “Ericsson sees this demonstration with Sony as a precursor to a powerful new world of personalized and interactive TV. This illustrates the potential for enriched communication services, gained by combining IMS and DLNA technologies.”

Keiji Kimura, Executive Vice President, Officer in charge of Technology Strategies, Sony Corporation, says: “We are very pleased to have this opportunity to demonstrate our technological collaboration with Ericsson. This shows the potential power of combining two crucial open standards, giving rise to new digital entertainment and communication applications.”

The evolving IPTV service has end user advantages over digital broadcast TV services in terms of interactivity and personalization. The combination of IPTV and DLNA-based technologies offers an integration of content and communication services, as well as converged services across mobile terminals and home devices. ",Public

"Dear Amy Following-up on my correspondence earlier in the year I wanted to extend an invitation for you to apply to present at our ""14th Annual National Business Funding Conference"" being held on December 3rd in the Grand Ballroom of the Yale Club New York. We are again expecting many prominent high net worth investors along with principals from more than 100 of the America's leading VCs and private equity funds from throughout the country. The video clip that is on the home page of our website at www.privateequityforums.com will give you better idea as to the format and quality of our events. Now in our 14th year with 51 fully-booked consecutive events behind us our deal-oriented venues are among the best investor-attended events of their kind in the US. If you are raising capital and need to go outside of your existing network of funding sources companies from early to later-stage see our events as a much less expensive and more efficient alternative to hiring an investment banker or going on the road to find investors. If you would like to accelerate the funding process the December 3rd conference could be a most effective tool for you to do so and significantly expand your universe of potential investors. To get an idea of what many other entrepreneurs have to say about our well-established investment conferences just go to http://www.privateequityforums.com/#!entre-test/crj5. We are extremely proud that our organization New York Private Equity Forums was selected by one of the leading business and investment publications Opportunist Magazine for one of their cover stories in which I was interviewed. If you would like to read this article entitled ""Connecting Investors and Entrepreneurs"" which addresses capital raising and chronicles the reasons for the long-standing success of our funding venues just go to http://opportunistmagazine.com/connecting-investors-and-entrepreneurs-name. To be Taken Off our List of Potential Presenter Candidates: As I indicated in my previous e-mails if you are all set with your financing requirements or have other avenues to get funded just let me know via return e-mail by putting ""delete"" (using lower-case) in the subject line and I will be sure that your e-mail address of amy_pascal@spe.sony.com is taken off my list of potential Presenter candidates right away. As this e-mail has not been sent to you by a commercial e-mailing service there is NO remove button. The procedure that I have set forth in this paragraph to be removed by using the Reply Feature is in compliance with the requirement to provide recipients with a both visible and ""easy-to-use"" method to prevent a person from getting any more e-mails. It is our policy to act on such delete requests immediately upon receipt. I know the last thing that you need are more e-mails that are not currently relevant to your business. My sincerest apologies if you made a prior request which has not yet been processed or may not have gotten through to us for technical reasons. Our Value Proposition - An Investor-Only Privately Underwritten Venue: In contrast with most groups that hold deal-oriented events our principal differentiator is that we are not part of any government agency or non-profit group nor are we supported or subsidized by vendors and service providers. As a result our events are Not compromised with a high population of lawyers accountants advisors and other non-investors. Accordingly our conferences are basically a co-op for the featured companies (a trade show model). We underwrite the venue with our own capital and the featured companies share in the cost. How much is it? As every company differs with respect to its financial resources stage revenues and funding requirements we do not have a ""one-size-fits-all"" structure with respect to fees payment terms or visibility options and will do our best to get a qualified company on the conference program. If you would like to find out what specifically your cost would be to present or attend please call me - as I will not know until I learn more about your company its funding requirements and any financial issues that you may be facing. To Get the Presenter Application Process Started Please Call. Do Not Write: My direct line at our Connecticut office is 203 438 4411. I have found that a brief conversation first can save a great deal of time on the back-and-forth of e-mail exchanges and will give me the opportunity to better respond to your questions in the context of your capital needs and financial position. You are also welcome to send me your Executive Summary and I will call you back as soon as possible. Please be sure that any info you send to me includes the best phone number for me to reach you. Thanks. It is my pleasure to take whatever time is necessary to make a determination if the company would be a good fit for the event and help you to identify the points that would be most important for you to emphasize in your presentation to investors. Please keep in mind that our events distinguish themselves from many other venues in several key respects as follows: 1) Nearly 100% of the guests (not connected with the presenting companies) are active investors who have PAID to attend. 2) Presenting companies reach a National audience of qualified funding sources focusing on early-stage opportunities. 3) Only 12 to 15 companies are featured on the program which provides for high visibility to investors. 4) The events are not primarily sponsor supported and accordingly not heavily populated with service providers. 5) There are no concurrent activities or competing presentations. All companies present to the entire audience. 6) Companies are never more than 10 to 20 minutes from their breakout sessions after they present. 7) These are ""deal-oriented"" events. There are no panels or other distractions that keep the spotlight from the presenters. 8) The majority of the attendees are Principals of the private equity or venture capital firms whom they represent. 9) Presenters can plan for the forums in advance as we provide confirmed guest information prior to the conference dates. 10) Featured companies benefit from the strong brand equity that we have built with investors over nearly 14 years. 11) Detailed contact information on all attending investors along with follow-up assistance is provided to entrepreneurs. 12) More than 5 hours networking time is provided to meet ""one-on-one"" with individual investors and venture capital firm partners. 13) Entrepreneurs have equal access to all investors who are never separated in higher-priced VIP areas or functions within the venue. 14) Because the investors come from throughout the United States this exclusive forum is like a ""Road Show"" that comes to the company. 15) Presenters are provided with customized targeted introductions from a universe of several thousand investors among our prior guests.

Hi Amy I'm a new writer who has written an LGBT themed screenplay (a message script written to entertain) that I hope Sony Pictures Entertainment may elect to purchase and produce into a motion picture. Please find details about my 96 page (one location) script Terrify Me below. Log Line: When terror filled text and voice messages by an unknown caller escalate to a break in and a game of lying in wait who will be left standing: Val a petite and stunning brunette or the Caller a six foot three mass of muscle. Synopsis: Terrify Me is about Val Velasquez a very passable and very striking gay (stage club) female impersonator who is being pursued by a homophobic stalker. Filled with humanity Terrify Me is designed to attract and have the masses (straight and queer alike) rooting for the gay female impersonator to overcome the hater that is stalking him. The story's big twist/hook (that addresses/explores feminine/masculine attributes) is that the gay female impersonator is also a ranked feather weight mixed martial arts cage fighter. The two links below (a local Los Angeles TV News Story and a Social Media Advisory About Murders in the Transgender Community) reveal/explain why I decided to write this screenplay. I want to help stop the hate. http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/06/02/family-of-beating-victim-say-attack-was-a-hate-crime/ http://www.care2.com/causes/its-time-to-remember-265-trans-people-murdered-in-2012.html If you are interested in reviewing my Psychological Thriller/Suspense Drama (WGA Registration Number: 1632845) by all means please find and read it here: http://terrifyme.weebly.com/ Thank you for your consideration. Kind regards Todd Somers Pasadena CA 626-421-6776,Private

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL All As requested Paul Weiss has prepared the attached “affirmative case” in connection with the SEC’s FCPA investigation. This draft envisions a scenario in which the SEC informally asks for our view of the matter and we advocate Sony’s affirmative themes at a high level. Thus the draft is naturally designed to argue -- and accentuate -- our strong points without dwelling on potential weaknesses. Although this presentation is formatted in Powerpoint (as recommended in a recent call) it is not something we are proposing to show or hand out to the SEC. Please also note that we would lead with only the talking points set forth in the first three substantive slides which largely concern DMG. The additional slides would be used purely on a reactive basis if we are asked about particular issues that the SEC has never previously mentioned. We look forward to discussing this with you further on our next call. Best Daniel J.

Dear Michael Thank you very much for your advise. I agree. We do not need to spend time on what we already covered in August.It is very much appreciated therefore if you could allocate the time as you suggested.During the brief update on Strategy we would like to confirm the priorities and make sure we agree on the winning road-map.Then we can spend most of the time for the financials including strategic investment/acquisition.It is also appreciated if you could talk about issues/challenges in order for us to achieve the MRP financial target. Thank you again and have a great weekend. Best regards Kaz T ------------------------------------------------------------------Kazuhiko Takeda 武田和彦VP Corporate Control Department & Accounting Division ------------------------------------------------------------------ From: Lynton Michael Sent: Saturday September 13 2014 9:33 AMTo: HQ/Ent/SecretariatCc: Hendler David; Seligman Nicole; Kober Steve; Hirai Kazuo; Yoshida Kenichiro; Totoki Hiroki; Takeda Kazuhiko (HQ); Saito Yoshinori (HQ)Subject: Re: Annual Mid Range Plan Session (Sony Picture Entertainment) Kotani-san Thank you for this. In reviewing the agenda might I suggest that we spend a brief time on updating everyone on strategy as we just covered the major issues in early August. And similarly we laid out most of the potential strategic acquisitions we are considering then and will provide you with updates on this. I suggest that we use the majority of the time you have allocated (which I think is the correct amount) to present in detail the financial numbers and how these are informed by strategic decisions we have made. I would suggest that most of the conversation relate to the financial numbers and the underlying strategies that drive them for the next few years. I think that this is the appropriate approach for all the entertainment companies. Please let me know if this is a useful way to approach the discussion and if it is we will proceed on this basis.

"Dear Michael Following-up on my correspondence earlier in the year I wanted to extend an invitation for you to apply to present at our ""14th Annual National Business Funding Conference"" being held on December 3rd in the Grand Ballroom of the Yale Club New York. We are again expecting many prominent high net worth investors along with principals from more than 100 of the America's leading VCs and private equity funds from throughout the country. The video clip that is on the home page of our website at www.privateequityforums.com will give you better idea as to the format and quality of our events. Now in our 14th year with 51 fully-booked consecutive events behind us our deal-oriented venues are among the best investor-attended events of their kind in the US. If you are raising capital and need to go outside of your existing network of funding sources companies from early to later-stage see our events as a much less expensive and more efficient alternative to hiring an investment banker or going on the road to find investors. If you would like to accelerate the funding process the December 3rd conference could be a most effective tool for you to do so and significantly expand your universe of potential investors. To get an idea of what many other entrepreneurs have to say about our well-established investment conferences just go to http://www.privateequityforums.com/#!entre-test/crj5. We are extremely proud that our organization New York Private Equity Forums was selected by one of the leading business and investment publications Opportunist Magazine for one of their cover stories in which I was interviewed. If you would like to read this article entitled ""Connecting Investors and Entrepreneurs"" which addresses capital raising and chronicles the reasons for the long-standing success of our funding venues just go to http://opportunistmagazine.com/connecting-investors-and-entrepreneurs-name. To be Taken Off our List of Potential Presenter Candidates: As I indicated in my previous e-mails if you are all set with your financing requirements or have other avenues to get funded just let me know via return e-mail by putting ""delete"" (using lower-case) in the subject line and I will be sure that your e-mail address of michael_lynton@spe.sony.com is taken off my list of potential Presenter candidates right away. As this e-mail has not been sent to you by a commercial e-mailing service there is NO remove button. The procedure that I have set forth in this paragraph to be removed by using the Reply Feature is in compliance with the requirement to provide recipients with a both visible and ""easy-to-use"" method to prevent a person from getting any more e-mails. It is our policy to act on such delete requests immediately upon receipt. I know the last thing that you need are more e-mails that are not currently relevant to your business. My sincerest apologies if you made a prior request which has not yet been processed or may not have gotten through to us for technical reasons. Our Value Proposition - An Investor-Only Privately Underwritten Venue: In contrast with most groups that hold deal-oriented events our principal differentiator is that we are not part of any government agency or non-profit group nor are we supported or subsidized by vendors and service providers. As a result our events are Not compromised with a high population of lawyers accountants advisors and other non-investors. Accordingly our conferences are basically a co-op for the featured companies (a trade show model). We underwrite the venue with our own capital and the featured companies share in the cost. How much is it? As every company differs with respect to its financial resources stage revenues and funding requirements we do not have a ""one-size-fits-all"" structure with respect to fees payment terms or visibility options and will do our best to get a qualified company on the conference program. If you would like to find out what specifically your cost would be to present or attend please call me - as I will not know until I learn more about your company its funding requirements and any financial issues that you may be facing. To Get the Presenter Application Process Started Please Call. Do Not Write: My direct line at our Connecticut office is 203 438 4411. I have found that a brief conversation first can save a great deal of time on the back-and-forth of e-mail exchanges and will give me the opportunity to better respond to your questions in the context of your capital needs and financial position. You are also welcome to send me your Executive Summary and I will call you back as soon as possible. Please be sure that any info you send to me includes the best phone number for me to reach you. Thanks. It is my pleasure to take whatever time is necessary to make a determination if the company would be a good fit for the event and help you to identify the points that would be most important for you to emphasize in your presentation to investors. Please keep in mind that our events distinguish themselves from many other venues in several key respects as follows: 1) Nearly 100% of the guests (not connected with the presenting companies) are active investors who have PAID to attend. 2) Presenting companies reach a National audience of qualified funding sources focusing on early-stage opportunities. 3) Only 12 to 15 companies are featured on the program which provides for high visibility to investors. 4) The events are not primarily sponsor supported and accordingly not heavily populated with service providers. 5) There are no concurrent activities or competing presentations. All companies present to the entire audience. 6) Companies are never more than 10 to 20 minutes from their breakout sessions after they present. 7) These are ""deal-oriented"" events. There are no panels or other distractions that keep the spotlight from the presenters. 8) The majority of the attendees are Principals of the private equity or venture capital firms whom they represent. 9) Presenters can plan for the forums in advance as we provide confirmed guest information prior to the conference dates. 10) Featured companies benefit from the strong brand equity that we have built with investors over nearly 14 years. 11) Detailed contact information on all attending investors along with follow-up assistance is provided to entrepreneurs. 12) More than 5 hours networking time is provided to meet ""one-on-one"" with individual investors and venture capital firm partners. 13) Entrepreneurs have equal access to all investors who are never separated in higher-priced VIP areas or functions within the venue. 14) Because the investors come from throughout the United States this exclusive forum is like a ""Road Show"" that comes to the company. 15) Presenters are provided with customized targeted introductions from a universe of several thousand investors among our prior guests. Look forward to being in touch if you feel that introducing your company to investors at this venue could be of help. As we only feature a limited number of companies please call me as soon as possible if you have an interest in being a featured company at the upcoming event.

Of course we do not know the expansion plans of your company or its need for capital but are always on the lookout for companies with strong growth prospects which may resonate with our investors.",Private
MichaelIt was fantastic - we missed you but the crowd was incredible - show is very energizing and a crowd pleaser. And I did a screening at Dreamworks Animation last night which was equally as exciting - Linda Woolverton and Margie Kohn were on the panel . Would you ever host a screening at SONY and then moderate a panel? Below is link to the show for you to watch - I think it would be a great company-wide thing to do and the film is fun. We're doing them at Disney and Universal as well just FYI. You could have your women's group host it but unless someone from the top is there it won't have the impact it needs.LINK TO SHOW (make sure you watch 2nd half with Judd Apatow Julia-Louis Dreyfuss Lena Dunham Ava DuVernay etc…)http://vimeo.com/103460020PW: makersI know I'm relentless.

Dear Michael It’s so great to talk you last weekend. We are excited about the things we discussed and looking forward to good things ahead. As for the strategic alliance ideas we'd love to address the following points and would love to talk with the authorized person for the follow-up: 1. Co-financing the buy-out deals shareholder % 1) we prefer to less than 50% of the shareholder of Starz; 2) and would love to talk about more big acquisition as well 2. Co-production opportunities in the future; 3. Chinese remake co-production opportunities; 4.

In reviewing the agenda might I suggest that we spend a brief time on updating everyone on strategy as we just covered the major issues in early August. And similarly we laid out most of the potential strategic acquisitions we are considering then and will provide you with updates on this. I suggest that we use the majority of the time you have allocated (which I think is the correct amount) to present in detail the financial numbers and how these are informed by strategic decisions we have made. I would suggest that most of the conversation relate to the financial numbers and the underlying strategies that drive them for the next few years. I think that this is the appropriate approach for all the entertainment companies. Please let me know if this is a useful way to approach the discussion and if it is we will proceed on this basis.

Hi Amy I'm a new writer who has written an LGBT themed screenplay (a message script written to entertain) that I hope Sony Pictures Entertainment may elect to purchase and produce into a motion picture. Please find details about my 96 page (one location) script Terrify Me below. Log Line: When terror filled text and voice messages by an unknown caller escalate to a break in and a game of lying in wait who will be left standing: Val a petite and stunning brunette or the Caller a six foot three mass of muscle. Synopsis: Terrify Me is about Val Velasquez a very passable and very striking gay (stage club) female impersonator who is being pursued by a homophobic stalker. Filled with humanity Terrify Me is designed to attract and have the masses (straight and queer alike) rooting for the gay female impersonator to overcome the hater that is stalking him. The story's big twist/hook (that addresses/explores feminine/masculine attributes) is that the gay female impersonator is also a ranked feather weight mixed martial arts cage fighter. The two links below (a local Los Angeles TV News Story and a Social Media Advisory About Murders in the Transgender Community) reveal/explain why I decided to write this screenplay. I want to help stop the hate. http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/06/02/family-of-beating-victim-say-attack-was-a-hate-crime/ http://www.care2.com/causes/its-time-to-remember-265-trans-people-murdered-in-2012.html If you are interested in reviewing my Psychological Thriller/Suspense Drama (WGA Registration Number: 1632845) by all means please find and read it here: http://terrifyme.weebly.com/ Thank you for your consideration.

And it “runs” every time anyone makes their purchases anywhere… …communicating with your customers as they are living their everyday life - while they are making purchases everywhere not only in your store or on your website. It’s instant rewards loyalty revenue and more. Do you need one? A reward program providing instant communications and rewards ~300 times per year - anywhere your customer shops for gasoline groceries clothing anything; in stores or online. Already have one? Then a complementary program will be built - supercharging your existing program with the same capability as above. Yes. This already exists today. It’s live in the marketplace. In a brief ~15 minute intro call I can explain how the ePlate® program works. After 15 minutes our existing 50+ reward partners who are LIVE on the ePlate® platform today were able to make their go/no-go decision. Why? There is literally no cost ($0) for the development of this program (as it’s funded by Dynamics) plus it provides instant communications with consumers and allows your company to earn revenue the day it goes live. At the end of the call most executives ask “Why wouldn’t I do this?” Do you have a 15 minute timeslot anytime this week? Thank you. Regards - Brian Brian Schuliger Dynamics Inc.

You know how much I've always wanted to work with you and this seems like a great fit with my skill set as well as an opportunity to make a transition from film to TV that capitalizes on my familiarity with the television landscape. I'm fortunate to be in a position where the title and compensation don't mean as much to me as the chance to work in a position that really interests me offers some new challenges an opportunity to learn and to work with a good team of people. Would you be open to considering someone at my level and background for this job? I'm very anxious to get back to full time work and am very optimistic that this may be the next chapter for me.

According to the NY Post analysts were expecting a cost closer to $30 a month to appeal to consumers looking for less expensive deals compared to cable packages.

According to the NY Post analysts were expecting a cost closer to $30 a month to appeal to consumers looking for less expensive deals compared to cable packages.

"GUT CHECK - A SPECIAL DRAMA WITH 100 EPISODE POTENTIALDear Mr. Mosko: It’s been a while since I’ve contacted you and I hope all is well. The reason I'm writing is because I'm representing a very special drama that I think will really excite you. It's called AC DREAMS and I strongly believe this is a project with 100-plus episode potential. Below this cover letter is a brief synopsis. By the way as an FYI my agency has submitted scripts in the past to both Columbia Pictures and Sony TV but my TV contacts are no longer there. Mr. Mosko if the AC DREAMS synopsis has intrigued you I'd welcome the opportunity to send you the pilot script and the Season One episode guide. Trust me you won't be disappointed. Thanks very much for your consideration. Sincerely Dave CantelmiCantelmi Literary Agency268 Elm CourtNorth Wales PA 19454Office Number: 215-661-8971 AC DREAMS SYNOPSIS ""What happens in Vegas may stay in Vegas but in the AC we ain't that discreet."" This one pilot episode line tells the story of AC DREAMS. AC DREAMS is a one-hour drama that revolves around the lives of several people working at a seedy Atlantic City sports bar called the Pit Boss. The central character is Tony a recent Ivy League graduate and the son of a famous investment manager. Tony’s rich smart and handsome; and on top of all that his bedroom skills are legendary. However when his father’s indicted for a Bernie Madoff-type scam Tony’s cushy world soon comes crashing down. Suddenly he’s the son of a pariah and because of the controversy no respectful company wants anything to do with him. Faced with this reality Tony’s forced to take a job at the notorious “Pit”. AC DREAMS will have many fascinating storylines and characters designed to appeal to both young and older audiences. Some of these characters include: Jake the disgraced college wrestler who now waits tables and does MMA fighting on the side; Carol the sexy but coldblooded cocktail waitress who uses and discards men mercilessly; Prince the tough iron-fisted owner who’s determined to change the Pit’s reputation; and Bert the middle-aged bartender who has both a gambling addiction and a pregnant teenage wife. The AC DREAM storylines will be edgy and compelling and below are a few examples from the episode guide. 1. A mysterious woman offers Tony information that might vindicate his father but only if he helps her with her sexual intimacy problems. 2. A Pit Boss Waiter causes a public uproar when he claims that God speaks through him about controversial topics. 3.

We are quickly breaking down the request and starting to figure out how we source a few items. The mobile phones seem to be the priority for placement. I know that the phones are Sony's priority as well. I've been asked to have the design team focus on creating an über modern phone instead of focusing on an existing product. They are happy to do so. However instead of them just coming up with any design...is there any design direction they should follow? Is there anything about the placement that they should know about that would effect the design? Is there any specific function they should know about for the design? I know we need these phones immediately so any direction to cut some time is good. Do you want to throw out some potential dates that all of you would be available to meet so the electronics team can do a ""show-and-tell?"" They need some time to get ready plus the logistics of importing products so maybe later October? Let me know. Thanks everyone. -G.

Hi. I just got this email about scheduling a conference call this Friday with Barbara to discuss Sony Electronics. Should I take the call or does it confuse things? With your permission I think I should take the call and just say that we need the placement and that we need a list of needed items for the movie to review. I will NOT reveal the new found contract language. Okay? Or just stay out of it for now? –G From: Evans Chas [mailto:chas.evans@roamspace.com] Sent: Wednesday September 17 2014 2:28 PMTo: Leon GeorgeCc: Robino Mary Goss; Kambe Sachiko; Gerstel Eliot; Ramunno Daniela; Newman JenniferSubject: CALL WITH EON RE: SONY ELECTRONICS George As discussed earlier the call will now take place on Friday and Barbara will join. Barbara Stephanie and Mary will all be at Shepperton for the Heineken shoot so it will probably best to set up a dial-in. The shoot is due to finish at 5.00pmUK/9.00amLA time so I suggest having the call at 6.00pmUK/10.00am. Best - Chas,Private

"Re: Did anyone from sony see story r they good One of my only other thoughts: that an impt truth of our film and message we must repeatedly be assertive and clear about is that it is not ""a zany comedy"" -- as galloway says -- which does not help for bst picture and is quite inaccurate. The whole soulful message of what people are living for loving as they are surviving -- that's the trilogy of last three films. And its not zany comedy. We might not even have been in any comedy category. We r more drama than wolf.

Variety: Paramount Marketing Chief Josh Greenstein Close to Deal At Sony By Alexandra Cheney September 2 2014 Former Paramount Pictures chief marketing officer Josh Greenstein is in final negotiations with Sony Pictures to succeed Jeff Blake as chairman of worldwide marketing and distribution according to people at the studio familiar with the matter. Blake was forced out of his job in late July after 22 years with the studio. Greenstein who has been at Paramount since 2005 and previously served as co-president of marketing and executive vice president of creative advertising has informed his bosses at the Viacom Inc.-owned studio that he would not be renewing his contract when it expires at the end of this year. This news comes on the heels of Paramount announcing Tuesday that Megan Colligan has been promoted to president of worldwide distribution and marketing. Erik Counter has been promoted to president worldwide creative advertising and Steve Siskind will become president of domestic marketing. Colligan who will report to vice chairman Rob Moore will now manage domestic and international theatrical as well as home media distribution. The organizational move to consolidate those efforts under one executive–which follows in the footsteps of rival studios–reflects the growing globalization of the movie business.,Private

Dear Amy Pascal: New Reality TV Show for Sony Pictures Digital Productions - Young fashion entrepreneur to make history at the most iconic venues Dear Amy Pascal After reviewing top TV production companies worldwide we have decided to pitch this idea to your company as we strongly believe in your ability of turning it into a tremendous global success. Model and entrepreneur Jessica Minh Anh (www.jessicaminhanh.tumblr.com) made history 5 times in the past 2 years by turning the world’s most iconic venues into phenomenal catwalks. She is the one and only fashion show organiser to gain exclusive permission to host the first ever fashion show on the Grand Canyon Skywalk London’s Tower Bridge Petronas Twin Towers’ Skybridge Seine River in Paris and Costa Atlantica’s sundeck in Dubai. Jessica’s creativity and boldness have quickly made her a Leader of the new generation of self-made entrepreneurs (Le Nouvel Observateur) Global fashion sensation (FashionTV) Global fashion mover and shaker (Marie Claire) and Style Icon (Canale 5 Italia). Catwalking at 4000 feet above the Colorado River or floating on the Seine in Paris is just the beginning. Jessica Minh Anh is heading to Asia’s superpower Singapore in March 2014 to host a catwalk in the sky on the award winning development ‘Gardens by the Bay’s Skyway’ before beginning her US domination in the summer. At the extreme speed of 3 months preparation per show Jessica Minh Anh is unstoppable. Jessica Minh Anh’s seasonal catwalks have been covered across the globe by the BBC ABC MTV ITV CNBC CNN FashionTV Style TV Vogue Italia Marie Claire Tatler Harper’s Bazaar L’Officiel WWD ELLE The Independent The National Daily Telegraph Le Nouvel Observateur Le Parisien La Repubblica Il Messaggero New Straits Times Condé Nast Travel and United Airline magazine among many others. Her contacts spread across 15 industries and she welcomes international fashion leaders country ambassadors politicians and Global 2000 directors to her exclusive showcases around the world. Jessica Minh Anh is known to have not only developed her own career but nurtured that of others. She runs a successful training programme and engaging skill workshop teaching the younger generation how to create a successful business. This might well be one of the most appealing qualities which makes Jessica a global sensation and idol of the young generation. Opening J Model Management (www.jmodelmanagement.co.uk) just one month after her graduation during the recession in 2009 Jessica has proven that fearless determination and hardwork make the wildest dreams come true. OUR GOAL We would like you to produce a brand new Reality TV show following Jessica Minh Anh’s upcoming catwalks around the world. With her excellent track record of flawless showcases she is able to gain permission to the most challenging and untouchable venues. Her upcoming plans in the US Italy France Russia Australia China etc. are expected to further redefine modern fashion standards. The show will follow Jessica as she trains a new team in each location makes connections with diverse groups of people attends various shows and parties and makes honest and bold statements about the challenges she faces as she races against time to put on the perfect show in under 3 months. Jessica already has a large number of fans and her artistic extravert and influential personality is no doubt a reality star material.

Amy Hope you are well and have had an enjoyable summer. Following-up on my correspondence earlier in the year I would like to speak to you about featuring Sony Pictures Entertainment at our upcoming National Business Investment Conference being held on October 2nd in the Grand Ballroom of the Yale Club New York. Now in our 14th year w/ 50 consecutive fully-booked events behind us the primary objective of our well-established funding venues is to introduce promising companies to a national audience of approximately of over 100 active early and later-stage investors who are looking for solid growth opportunities. If you are all set with your financing requirements or have other avenues to get funded please let me know by return e-mail and I will be sure that your company is taken off my distribution list. I know that the last thing you need are more e-mails that are not relevant to the matters affecting you business. In the event that you are seeking capital and it is important to accelerate the process you may want to seriously consider being one of the 12 to 15 select Presenters at October 2nd event. This unique venue will give you a chance to get you story out to highly qualified audience of venture capital firms high net worth investors Angel Groups and private equity funds from all over the United States “in one place and in one day”. Most companies see our events as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to going on the road or hiring an investment banker. If you would like to see what other entrepreneurs have to say about us just go to the References and Testimonials posted at www.privateequityforums.com/entre-test.html. Our exclusive “investor-only” venues are not “feel good” events that have hundreds of people who for the most part are vendors and service providers but have few actual capital sources in attendance. This is in part because our deal-oriented conferences are not supported by paid sponsors charities non-profit groups or government agencies. Accordingly to participate companies do pay a fee to participate based upon a number of visibility options that we try to tailor to each company. This model of self-underwriting our events ensures presenting companies a very target-rich environment and a most favorable setting to raise capital in venue that is not compromised by a high population of non-investors. Please keep in mind that this prestigious venue can help you solve the three biggest problems in raising capital 1) identifying qualified investors 2) gaining credible entrée to them and 3) meeting them under favorable circumstances. Moreover the event drives the single most essential factor in getting funded quickly and that is the ability to create contemporaneous interest among investors - which also can serve to significantly improve deal terms. Please call. Do not write. - If you want to be considered for the conference program the best way to start the process is to send me a current copy of you Executive Summary and call me in my Connecticut office at 203 438 4411. Kindly note there are NO FEES JUST TO APPLY. It is my pleasure to take whatever time is necessary to make a determination if the company would be a good fit for the event and help you to identify the points that would be most important for you to emphasize in your presentation to investors. As we will be completing the Presenter roster shortly please contact me as soon as possible with respect to your interest in being on the program. More information about the event can be found online at www.privateequityforums.com/message.html. In addition to see which investment groups that we can put in touch with in connection with the upcoming event just go online to www.starlightcapital.com/?id=276 and then click on the industry sector or sectors which are most applicable to your company. Again if you would not like to receive any further information on upcoming conferences please let us know by return e-mail and your e-mail address of amy_pascal@spe.sony.com will be promptly deleted from our distribution list. In this regard please provide us with any other e-mail addresses that you use to ensure that you receive no further communications from our office. I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about your funding requirements.

The Wrap: Josh Greenstein Leaving Paramount for Top Marketing Job at Sony By Jeff SneiderSeptember 2 2014 His appointment comes on the heels of a monster opening for “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” Paramount's Josh Greenstein is nearing a deal to replace Marc Weinstock as the head of marketing at Sony Pictures Entertainment an individual familiar with the situation has told TheWrap. Greenstein had been in negotiations to re-up at Paramount but did an about-face in recent weeks and is now heading across town to the Culver City studio. In response to Greenstein's departure Paramount has announced three promotions from within its marketing distribution and advertising teams elevating home-grown talent to key positions in the organization under studio vice chairman Rob Moore. Megan Colligan has been promoted to president of worldwide distribution and marketing overseeing distribution and marketing for Paramount's theatrical and home media groups and continuing to report to Moore. Erik Counter has been promoted to president of worldwide creative advertising and will now report to Moore. Steve Siskind has been promoted to President Domestic Marketing and will report to Colligan. As part of these changes Paramount will now manage domestic and international theatrical as well as home media distribution under Colligan reporting to Moore a move that will align the organizational structure with the changing needs of consumers globally. Josh Greenstein who has served as Paramount's CMO since 2011 will not renew his contract when it comes to a close later this year. “We take great pride in the depth of talented professionals at Paramount and are excited to grow the roles of Megan Erik and Steve” said Paramount Pictures Chairman & CEO Brad Grey. “These promotions reflect our trust in their talents confidence built upon their experience and the success each has had working across our staff and partners. Under Rob Moore‘s leadership our motion picture marketing has become the best in the business and we look forward to this new team structure continuing that success.” “I also want to thank Josh Greenstein” Grey continued. “We are truly grateful to Josh for his contributions to our studio and the great work he did here and we wish him the best for the future.” “As the global marketing and distribution of our films continues to evolve this new structure will allow us a seamless organization and coordination between Paramount and our consumers whether they are purchasing a ticket to a theater purchasing a DVD or downloading a digital copy of our films” said Moore. “Having worked closely with Megan Erik and Steve I have seen first-hand the innovative and effective approach they bring to their jobs and we are excited for them to apply their talents in their expanded roles.”,Private

"2014 National Business Funding Conference │ Grand Ballroom │ Yale Club New York │ Wednesday │ December 3rd Opportunity to reach More than 100 Prominent Investors Leading Angel Groups Venture Capital Firms & Private Equity Funds A Limited Number of Presenter Slots are still Available for Early and Later-Stage Companies Raising Capital Please Apply to Present by this Wednesday December 12th to Ensure Consideration Dear Amy: With our next funding venue coming-up on December 3rd I am writing to you again as we are always on the look-out for promising companies like Sony Pictures Entertainment that may resonate with the universe of Angels VCs Family Offices and other private investors who attend our well-established investment conferences. In today’s tight-money environment many good businesses from early to later-stage and middle-market are finding it difficult to obtain financing as their current banking and private investor relationships are no longer reliable funding sources. Companies see our ""investor-centric"" funding venues as a highly efficient and cost-effective alternative to hiring an Investment Banker or going on a Road Show to raise money. You can see a video from one of our events on the conference website at www.privateequityforums.com/index.html#!home/mainPage. This should give you a better sense of the venue as well as the high quality and dynamics of our prestigious conferences. In the event that you are all set with your funding requirements and existing capital sources just advise me by return e-mail with a notation to ""Delete"" in the subject line and I’ll be sure to take your e-mail address of amy_pascal@spe.sony.com off our list of potential Presenter candidates right away. (Kindly do not use all caps to ensure receipt.) Although we have not had a chance to speak about this event or your company's funding requirements kindly note that this correspondence is not part of a bulk mailing being delivered to you by a commercial e-mailing service and I have sent it to you personally on the basis of general research that our staff has undertaken on your company - based upon its industry sector and stage of operations. As this e-mail has not been sent to you by a commercial e-mailing service there is no remove button. The procedure that I have set forth in the paragraph below to be removed by using the Reply Feature is in compliance with the requirement to provide recipients with a visible and “easy-to-use” method to prevent a person from getting any more e-mails. If you are seeking capital and things are not going as quickly as you would like I wanted to let you know that we would be pleased to accept your application to present at our upcoming National Business Funding Conference being held in the Grand Ballroom of the Yale Club New York on Wednesday December 3rd. Your visibility at this unique event could quite possibly enhance your ability to accelerate the funding process with a view of raising capital within the next few months. These “deal-oriented” forums that we have been hosting for nearly 14 years are among the best investor-attended events of their kind in the U.S. During this period I believe that we have provided entrepreneurs with greater access to more investors than any other organization in the country. If you would like see what other business people have had to say about our national investor forums please go to http://www.privateequityforums.com/index.html# . By the way you may be interested in knowing that our organization was selected by Opportunist Magazine for a cover story in which I was interviewed. If you would like to read this article entitled “Connecting Investors and Entrepreneurs” which addresses capital raising and chronicles the reasons for the success of our business funding venues just go to http://opportunistmagazine.com/connecting-investors-and-entrepreneurs/#more-10605. Reserving Presenter Slot and Application Process - Please Call. Do Not Write: As a courtesy we can tentatively hold a Presenter slot for the company while you are considering this opportunity subject to your confirmation and a customary review of the company on our part. My direct line at our Connecticut office is 203 438 4411. I have found that a brief conversation first can save a great deal of time on the back-and-forth of e-mail exchanges and will give me the opportunity to better respond to your questions in the context of your capital needs and financial position. You are also welcome to send me your Executive Summary and I will call you back as soon as possible... Please be sure that any info you send to me includes the best phone number for me to reach you. Thanks. It is my pleasure to take whatever time is necessary to make a determination if the company would be a good fit for the event and help you to identify the points that would be most important for you to emphasize in your presentation to investors. Thanks for taking a few minutes to read this e-mail carefully as many of your questions will be answered and you will get a much better idea as to the value proposition has attracted so many companies to our events from all over the United States and other countries. There is no comparable funding venue in the United States to what we offer as measured by the number and quality of the active capital sources who attend our forums - not to mention the fact that we also reach out to investors for our entrepreneur participants and assist them in following-up after our event. Overview: This prestigious event could provide you with a highly effective opportunity to meet qualified investors and financial partners in what will also be a very prestigious setting. We expect principals from more than 100 active early and later-stage investment funds to attend from throughout the United States - representing more than $200 billion in capital. In addition many high net worth investors and a number of prominent angel groups will be joining us. In addition to the brand-equity of our venues the strong investor response to our recent events would indicate that there is no shortage of interest from investment funds and private investors who are looking for serious opportunities in promising early and later-stage companies. From our vantage point we can see there is a clear readiness to invest from many VCs private equity funds and Angels who understand that historically it is in times like these that the best investment opportunities are available. Very Important Regarding Fees: In the event that you are not already familiar with our venues kindly note our “principal differentiator” is that unlike most groups which organize deal-oriented events we are not part of any government agency or non-profit group nor are we primarily subsidized by paid sponsors i.e. vendors or service providers so as to not compromise our forums with a high population of non-investors such as lawyers accountants advisors recruiters and others offering services. Our private “investor-only” conferences could be best described as a co-op for the 15 to 20 Presenters and other featured companies. We underwrite the events and the entrepreneurs share in the cost (just like a trade show) the amount and terms of which we try to customize to a company’s particular financial situation. As a result companies are required to pay a fee to attend or present based upon a number of factors which may include a contingent or differed payment. How much is it? As every company differs with respect to its financial resources stage revenues and funding requirements we do not have a “one-size-fits-all” structure with respect to fees payment terms or visibility options and will do our best to get a qualified company on the conference program. Accordingly if you would like to find out what specifically your cost would be to present or attend please call me - as I will not know until I learn more about your company its funding requirements and any financial issues that you may be facing. Presenter Qualifications: The cornerstone of our events is to showcase promising early and later-stage companies which we believe are fundable and have the potential to be part of the next generation of emerging growth companies. With respect to the Presenter qualifications we for the most part feature post-revenue companies that have already had some meaningful Angel or “A” round VC funding. Although we prefer companies with some revenue we will also consider pre-revenue development-stage companies with new platform technology or some proof of concept so long as they are not raw un-funded start-ups and they have already had some initial outside funding. I would be pleased to discuss the participation options and costs when we have a chance to talk. One thing that you can be certain of is that any fees associated with presenting or attending our events are substantially less that than the costs of extensive travel to meet investors or the front-end fees and retainers charged by placement agents to reach the same caliber of investors who regularly attend our events. More information on general Presenter qualifications can be found on our website at www.privateequityforums.com/qualifications.html and www.privateequityforums.com/profiles.html. Please keep in mind that our events distinguish themselves from many other venues in several key respects as listed below: 1) Nearly 100% of the guests (not connected with the presenting companies) are active investors who have PAID to attend. 2) Presenting companies reach a NATIONAL audience of qualified funding sources focusing on early-stage opportunities. 3) Only 12 to 15 companies are featured on the program which provides for high visibility to investors. 4) The events are not primarily sponsor supported and accordingly NOT heavily populated with service providers. 5) There are no concurrent activities or competing presentations. All companies present to the entire audience. 6) Companies are never more than 10 to 20 minutes from their breakout sessions after they present. 7) These are “deal-oriented” events. There are no panels or other distractions that keep the spotlight from the presenters. 8) The majority of the attendees are PRINCIPALS of the private equity or venture capital firms whom they represent. 9) Presenters can plan for the forums in advance as we provide confirmed guest information prior to the conference dates. 10) Featured companies benefit from the strong brand equity that we have built with investors for more than 10 years. 11) Detailed contact information on all attending investors along with follow-up assistance is provided to entrepreneurs. 12) More than 5 hours networking time is provided to meet “one-on-one” with individual investors and venture capital firm partners. 13) Entrepreneurs have equal access to all investors who are NEVER separated in higher-priced VIP areas or functions within the venue. 14) Because the investors come from throughout the United States this exclusive forum is like a “Road Show” that comes to the company. 15) Presenters are provided with customized targeted introductions from a universe of several thousand investors among our prior guests. Our private equity forums started in 2001 are noted for a first-class venue and an ultra high-end roster of funding sources. These deal-focused symposiums have provided a remarkably beneficial venue for companies to reach a national audience of qualified potential investors. The management of presenting companies benefit from being able to get their story across to a receptive audience of investors in a very favorable upscale setting. Our experience has shown that the investor venue created through our forums can significantly reduce the cost of capital as well as the time necessary to raise it particularly in this current market with fewer active players for early-stage companies and tougher investment criteria. Our funding venues open a national portal to a audience of active investors. The upcoming venue can help you solve the three biggest problems in raising capital 1) identifying qualified investors 2) gaining credible entrée to them and 3) meeting them under favorable circumstances. Moreover the event drives the single most essential factor in getting funded quickly and that is the ability to create contemporaneous interest among investors - which also can serve to significantly improve deal terms. Again of particular importance is the fact that our events are not primarily supported by paid sponsors. As a result they are not heavily populated by service providers or vendors who would have no interest in investing in your company. Because we draw from all over the country this venue will be a less costly way for Presenters to meet investors from outside of their particular regions. You should also be aware that the majority of our guests are partners founders and managing directors of their respective firms; affording the featured companies a chance to reach senior people from the outset. Targeted Investor Outreach: If your company is selected to present M. J. Segal Associates can provide you with introductions to any of the firms listed on the conference website irrespective of their attendance at the upcoming event. As I previously mentioned companies can pay investment bankers up to several hundred thousand dollars in front-end fees and monthly retainers to gain access to these types of investment groups. Companies presenting at this forum gain the same entrée at only a small fraction of that cost notwithstanding the inherent efficiency of our highly-targeted venue. You can find a complete listing of our prior conference registrants organized by “Industry Sector Preferences” at http://www.starlightinvestments.com/?id=276. Presenter Qualifications: With respect to the Presenter qualifications again we favor companies with some revenues but will also consider pre-revenue development-stage companies with new platform technology or some proof of concept which has had some funding. Revenues forecast by the third year following funding should approach $15 to $20 million. Preferred industry sectors are Information Management Systems Enterprise Software Business Process Management Computer Technology Wireless Technology Social Media Telecommunications eCommerce Energy Technology Network Hardware and Software Healthcare Services Education & Training Medical Devices Manufacturing Technology New Media and Publishing Internet-Based Business Solutions Life Sciences Distance Learning Financial Services Consumer Marketing Specialty Retail Outsourced Business Services Cleantech Homeland Security and Supply Chain Management. Other sectors may also be considered with sufficient growth potential. If raising capital is the primary obstacle that stands in the way of moving your company forward you should seriously consider the visibility that we can provide at the upcoming event. As I am sure you are aware most professional investors will not even consider deals where they do not personally know management or those which have not been referred by a reliable source. Our forums significantly help to remove these barriers to management's power to reach qualified investors. Our upcoming event can provide the third-party endorsement and credibility which is so critical for getting funded in today’s market. We sincerely believe that if a company's potential is truly compelling and that management's vision can be effectively communicated; it will not find a more cost-effective way to reach potential funding sources directly than by presenting at the upcoming event. Again this is a unique opportunity to get your message across in “one place and in one day” to active serious investors who want to see fundable deals. Again if you would not like to receive any further information on upcoming conferences please let us know by return e-mail and your name will be promptly deleted from our distribution list. In this regard please provide us with any other e-mail addresses that you use to ensure that you receive no further communications from our office. We look forward to hearing from you and learning more about your funding requirements. Kindest regards Mike Segal President LinkedIn Profile: www.linkedin.com/in/mjsegal M. J. Segal Associates 531 Main Street - Suite 1116 New York New York 10044 Direct Line: 203 438 4411 www.privateequityforums.com About “So-Called” Free Events: Over the last almost 14 years we have clearly demonstrated as is true with most things in life “it is not what or if you pay but what you get for what you pay.” Please keep in mind that any investor venue (irrespective of its quality) that offers the opportunity to present for free is ONLY free for those who are selected from what is in most cases hundreds of companies that have applied. The odds are against you from the outset. And if you are NOT selected the fact that it was free to present made absolutely no difference - and you are back to the open-end costs of knocking on the doors of investors with little or no entrée. In many venues companies that are selected to present for free are then charged up to $1000 per person for each member of the management team who attends. So was it really free to present. Certainly not. Conferences of our class cost tens of thousands of dollars to produce. Accordingly someone has to pay for them - raising the questions are presenting companies at budget-priced or free venues getting real value? Are they talking to an audience of bona fide investors as is the case with our events or to seats that are full of vendors and service providers who have funded the venue? What is a free bag of potatoes worth if there are no potatoes in the bag? For those entrepreneurs who do not make the cut to present at ""so-called"" free events then they need to pay to be there - in most cases from about $700 to $1500 per person. We saw one “free to present if selected event” that was charging the “not chosen to present entrepreneurs” $4000 just to attend and get special VIP access to investors. To present at our events entrepreneurs are selected based upon their “individual merit” - not graded on a curve and do not need to win a competition based upon some subjective definition of ""The Best"". I wonder if Cisco Systems Amazon Google e-Bay or Starbucks would have made it through a presenter selection contest. Looking at the number of VCs who turned many of them down I would say probably not… We simply want to see qualified companies based upon reasonable criteria (such as scalability and proprietary advantage) which we believe are likely to resonate with a good percentage of our investors and are run by entrepreneurs who understand the prudence and wisdom of intelligently committing some dollars to accelerate their capital raising. Editorial Comment and Event Overview: In addition to the fact that our events are not heavily populated with vendors and service providers it is important to note that all of the entrepreneurs at our forums have an “equal opportunity” to personally engage with investors throughout the event; and are never relegated to being in a paid-for “Demo Pit” outside the main conference area with the hope of perhaps being selected to present for no fee. Every one of our visibility options irrespective of the cost guarantee entrepreneurs “full and easy access” to all of the capital sources attending as well as an extremely high profile at the event. At no time during our forums are any investors ever sequestered from entrepreneurs in private Vip areas or at our event functions such as the Luncheon and Dinner/Reception where a special high payment is required for corporate executives to gain access as is the case at certain other conferences. In fact the key element of our prestigious venues is that all entrepreneurs whether or not they are Presenters have a chance to get to know each of the Angels and Partners of the investment groups on a personal level which then opens the door to establishing your credentials and sharing management’s vision for the company. The agenda allows approximately 6 hours of unstructured time for socialization and networking which will give you an extended window to tell your story while forging relationships with the individual investors and principals of the VCs & private equity funds in attendance. Moreover companies participating at our events are NOT held hostage by the decisions of judges or sponsors as to whether or not they will have a chance to present since those arrangements are made prior to the venue. As a result our entrepreneurs will NEVER find themselves in a situation where they pay for one thing such as to be in a “Demo Pit” with the hope of getting a chance to present. In addition we do not have any Best of Show awards which can serve to de facto undermine the quality of those companies that do not win. We feel that the national audience we deliver of Angel investors and principals from top private equity and venture capital firms are more than well-qualified to decide which of our featured companies represent the right opportunities for them – and do not need anyone else to tell them which are the best deals. In our opinion the ONLY thing that counts is the number of investors who ultimately vote with their checkbook.",Private

Engaged Capital the California-based activist group led by Glenn Welling confirmed its stake in Volcano on Monday and said it hoped to engender the changes without taking a seat on the board. The move comes at a time when shareholder activism is on the rise with a number of high-profile positions taken by investors during the past few months including Daniel Loeb’s stake in upmarket auction house Sotheby’s. Mr Welling has been building up a stake in Volcano since July and considers the company’s shares to be undervalued due to investor fears that management will pursue dilutive acquisitions. The company which specialises in making diagnostic scanners that identify blocked coronary arteries has raised $450m though convertible bonds since last December to fuel acquisitions. Mr Welling is calling on Volcano’s management to use the funds instead to buy back shares. In addition a filing on Monday urged Volcano’s board to create a pay structure more aligned with management’s success at reaching their stated targets. Volcano could not be reached for comment. Engaged Capital which was founded last year by Mr Welling says it specialises in small- and mid-cap North American equities and is dedicated to an investment style it terms “constructive activism.” The Newport Beach-based company was seeded by Grosvenor Capital Management.,Private

I am writing to invite you and your colleagues to be my guest as a webcast participant in a Law & Reorder event on Wednesday December 11 2013 from 12:30 - 2 p.m. EST. At the event I will interview economist and thought leader Sylvia Ann Hewlett about her latest book Forget a Mentor Find a Sponsor. We will discuss how to fast-track your career by getting a sponsor — a senior-level champion who believes in your potential and is willing to advocate for your next raise or promotion. Mixing solid data with vivid real-life narratives Hewlett will share how to forge the relationships that truly have the power to propel your career. Attached is an invite with more about the topic and all of the particulars. This will be a high profile event that I imagine will be very compelling for both your male and female colleagues to attend. There will be an emphasis in the program on how sponsorship relationships can be successfully developed for women and people of color when these relationships are at times not as organic. We anticipate the NYC event will be oversubscribed and we expect hundreds of in-house and law firm lawyers to participate by webcast in conference rooms of their employers around the country. We would like to extend this complimentary non-transferable invitation for your company to participate by webcast. Please let my assistant Renee Newell at rnewell@lawandreorder.com know as soon as possible (and no later than December 6) whether your company would like to participate. If so Renee will be back in touch with the login information to enable you to set up your conference room for participation. We are asking webcast participants to watch the webcast collectively in a conference room (or conference rooms if there are multiple offices interested) as we are not able to accommodate individuals signing in at their desks. If we don’t hear from you by December 6 we will assume that your company will not be participating. Thank you and have a great holiday! Best Debbie Deborah Epstein Henry Esq.

"Leah and Len - Hope you both had a wonderful summer. Please let me know if you would like our assistance with this matter. Courtney R. Rockett Esq. BOIES SCHILLER & FLEXNER LLP 333 Main Street Armonk New York 10504 Telephone: (914) 749-8242 Facsimile: (914) 749-8300 Email: crockett@bsfllp.com -----Original Message----- Lawsuit says Disney Sony others conspired to suppress wages 5:20pm EDT By Brendan Pierson Sept 8 (Reuters) - A federal lawsuit filed on Monday accuses Walt Disney Co Sony Pictures and other leaders in special effects and animation of conspiring to suppress wages in the industry through ""no-raid"" agreements. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in San Jose California also names DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc Digital Domain 3.0 and ImageMovers LLC as defendants. The proposed class action alleges that the defendants agreed not to poach employees from one another artificially depressing wages. Disney had already reached a $9 million settlement with salaried employees in July 2013 as part of a broader class action over no-raid agreements in the California technology industry. The proposed class in the new lawsuit consists of ""technical artistic creative and/or research and development"" employees and is not restricted to salaried employees. The lawsuit alleges that the conspiracy in the animation industry dates back to 1986 when Lucasfilm Ltd and Pixar now both part of Disney agreed not to cold call each other's employees and not to outbid each other's pay offers according to the complaint. Other defendants entered into similar agreements with one another by the mid-2000s or even earlier according to the complaint. The lawsuit points to numerous emails from company executives referring to no-raid agreements. In one 2007 email Pixar president Ed Catmull is quoted as saying that poaching each others' employees with higher pay offers ""seriously messes up the pay structure."" In another email Catmull is quoted as saying that the animation companies had ""avoided wars"" because they had ""conscientiously avoided raiding each other."" Catmull acted as an enforcer according to the complaint urging other companies to stick to the no-raid rule even when they weren't directly threatening Pixar. In addition to the no-raid agreements the lawsuit alleges that the companies' senior human resources and recruiting personnel met yearly to compare employee pay. The defendants could not immediately be reached for comment. The new lawsuit comes about a month after U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose refused to approve a proposed $324.5 million settlement in the broader tech industry suit partly because she found recovery for the class members would be too low compared with the Disney settlement approved earlier. Defendants in that case including Google Inc and Apple Inc are appealing her ruling. The case is Nitsch v. DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc et al U.S. District Court Northern District of California No. 5:14-cv-04062.

Variety: Paramount Marketing Chief Josh Greenstein Close to Deal At Sony By Alexandra Cheney September 2 2014 Former Paramount Pictures chief marketing officer Josh Greenstein is in final negotiations with Sony Pictures to succeed Jeff Blake as chairman of worldwide marketing and distribution according to people at the studio familiar with the matter. Blake was forced out of his job in late July after 22 years with the studio. Greenstein who has been at Paramount since 2005 and previously served as co-president of marketing and executive vice president of creative advertising has informed his bosses at the Viacom Inc.-owned studio that he would not be renewing his contract when it expires at the end of this year. This news comes on the heels of Paramount announcing Tuesday that Megan Colligan has been promoted to president of worldwide distribution and marketing. Erik Counter has been promoted to president worldwide creative advertising and Steve Siskind will become president of domestic marketing. Colligan who will report to vice chairman Rob Moore will now manage domestic and international theatrical as well as home media distribution. The organizational move to consolidate those efforts under one executive–which follows in the footsteps of rival studios–reflects the growing globalization of the movie business.,Private
Sony & 12/11/13 VIP Webcast Invite Dear Leah: It’s been a while since we’ve been in touch and I hope you’re well. I am writing to invite you and your colleagues to be my guest as a webcast participant in a Law & Reorder event on Wednesday December 11 2013 from 12:30 - 2 p.m. EST. At the event I will interview economist and thought leader Sylvia Ann Hewlett about her latest book Forget a Mentor Find a Sponsor. We will discuss how to fast-track your career by getting a sponsor — a senior-level champion who believes in your potential and is willing to advocate for your next raise or promotion. Mixing solid data with vivid real-life narratives Hewlett will share how to forge the relationships that truly have the power to propel your career. Attached is an invite with more about the topic and all of the particulars. This will be a high profile event that I imagine will be very compelling for both your male and female colleagues to attend. There will be an emphasis in the program on how sponsorship relationships can be successfully developed for women and people of color when these relationships are at times not as organic. We anticipate the NYC event will be oversubscribed and we expect hundreds of in-house and law firm lawyers to participate by webcast in conference rooms of their employers around the country. We would like to extend this complimentary non-transferable invitation for your company to participate by webcast. Please let my assistant Renee Newell at rnewell@lawandreorder.com know as soon as possible (and no later than December 6) whether your company would like to participate. If so Renee will be back in touch with the login information to enable you to set up your conference room for participation. We are asking webcast participants to watch the webcast collectively in a conference room (or conference rooms if there are multiple offices interested) as we are not able to accommodate individuals signing in at their desks.

The Wrap: Josh Greenstein Leaving Paramount for Top Marketing Job at Sony By Jeff SneiderSeptember 2 2014 His appointment comes on the heels of a monster opening for “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” Paramount's Josh Greenstein is nearing a deal to replace Marc Weinstock as the head of marketing at Sony Pictures Entertainment an individual familiar with the situation has told TheWrap. Greenstein had been in negotiations to re-up at Paramount but did an about-face in recent weeks and is now heading across town to the Culver City studio. In response to Greenstein's departure Paramount has announced three promotions from within its marketing distribution and advertising teams elevating home-grown talent to key positions in the organization under studio vice chairman Rob Moore. Megan Colligan has been promoted to president of worldwide distribution and marketing overseeing distribution and marketing for Paramount's theatrical and home media groups and continuing to report to Moore. Erik Counter has been promoted to president of worldwide creative advertising and will now report to Moore. Steve Siskind has been promoted to President Domestic Marketing and will report to Colligan. As part of these changes Paramount will now manage domestic and international theatrical as well as home media distribution under Colligan reporting to Moore a move that will align the organizational structure with the changing needs of consumers globally. Josh Greenstein who has served as Paramount's CMO since 2011 will not renew his contract when it comes to a close later this year. “We take great pride in the depth of talented professionals at Paramount and are excited to grow the roles of Megan Erik and Steve” said Paramount Pictures Chairman & CEO Brad Grey. “These promotions reflect our trust in their talents confidence built upon their experience and the success each has had working across our staff and partners. Under Rob Moore‘s leadership our motion picture marketing has become the best in the business and we look forward to this new team structure continuing that success.” “I also want to thank Josh Greenstein” Grey continued. “We are truly grateful to Josh for his contributions to our studio and the great work he did here and we wish him the best for the future.” “As the global marketing and distribution of our films continues to evolve this new structure will allow us a seamless organization and coordination between Paramount and our consumers whether they are purchasing a ticket to a theater purchasing a DVD or downloading a digital copy of our films” said Moore. “Having worked closely with Megan Erik and Steve I have seen first-hand the innovative and effective approach they bring to their jobs and we are excited for them to apply their talents in their expanded roles.”,Private

"Sony Pictures Michael Just wanted to keep you up on what has happened since you sent my screenplay to Eric Fineman. After getting Eric's notes and discussing the project with him I did a page one rewrite and renamed the script The Nominee. Eric tells me that the script is at a point where an ""A"" list producer or star could be interested. In all candor he said that since he was a just a junior executive my cause would be best advanced if I got a producer on my team and then came back to him or you. Perhaps Eric was being kind but I do believe that he really put me on the right track and if his first review of my screenplay was fair in that it was a political thriller in the vein of Michael Clayton The Contender or Seven Days in May the changes that I have made certainly advanced the project closer to that notion. We discussed several producers who may be appropriate to advance The Nominee. Some of those producers included Mark Gordan and John Davis. As you know I am passionate about getting this project made. So please bear with me as I lean on you for help and guidance. If you are cool with it I would love to talk with you about any producers that you like and trust and that you might feel comfortable reaching out to who would read The Nominee and visit with me while I am in L.A. As always I appreciate your wise counsel and help!!! Tim Attachments: TheNominee.pdf (214515 Bytes) ATT00001.htm (381 Bytes)",Private
"Sony Pictures Entertainment collaboration: The Stairs Hello Michael I work closely with Tom Van Daele owner of Unknownlab which is a marketing and branding agency with offices in Los Angeles New York and Belgium. As a company of wannabe athletes we're heavily involved in the development of the up-and-coming sport of “Vertical Running” a.k.a. “Stair Climbing”. Actually the growing sport is a passion of Tom. In the past year we've put together a solid plan to raise awareness for the sport and conceptualized several initiatives to turn it into the next Crossfit or UFC craze for the masses. The plan currently on the table features: • A scripted mockumentary show • A series of live events • A line of innovative consumer products As a result we're seeking a powerful digital media partner that wants to be at the forefront of something new and big here. In the past weeks we have shown our 3 pilot episodes to some leading athletic brands and many of them have responded with great interest. We now turn our focus to a media partner and hope we can gain as much traction with you as we are currently experiencing on brand side. The Reality Show The ""mockumentary"" series is called The Stairs (http://thestairs.com/) and features our team of marketing ""geniuses"" who embark on a project to monetize this extraordinary and unique phenomenon that is only found in the California city of Santa Monica: The Santa Monica Stairs. It's really quite the phenomenon! Right in our back yard between the most impressive multi-million dollar mansions there's a wooden staircase with the most breathtaking view and it attracts a vast range of people from the LA community: athletes actors wannabe actors porn stars firefighters opportunists socialites and lots of sexy people that just want to be seen. Tom (a stairs fanatic himself) assembles a running team that includes Woody Harrelson's brother Brett (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf2_0DoMuHo) and one of the world's fastest marathon athletes Blue Benadum. Business conflict and camaraderie ensue as Blue is in it for the sake of extraordinary athleticism while Brett - the quintessential D-list celebrity playboy - can’t see a purpose beyond girls girls and... more girls. Tom's focus on the other hand is all about using his company to market this odd phenomenon and make lots of money. The show features a plethora of aspirational LA-beach-lifestyle footage hot guys and hot girls in (and out of) skin-tight yoga pants parties drama and several of Brett's A-list celebrity friends. We'd like to grab any opportunity to show you our 3 pilot episodes and discuss a potential collaboration between both our companies.

His resume is attached but in a quick summary Oliver has had a great blend of blue-chip and entrepreneurial work experiences so far. · Blue Chip: summer internships at ESPN Polo Ralph Lauren and Discovery· Entrepreneurial: selling mattresses in L.A. working construction selling his own gallery quality images on his photography website He’s a fabulous people-person really smart a great team player curious creative and an independent thinker… he’s just a great young man (of course I’m biased ). Thanks very much for helping him get set up for the right conversations at SPC. Best Jim James M.

"2014 National Business Funding Conference │ Grand Ballroom │ Yale Club New York │ Wednesday │ December 3rd Opportunity to reach More than 100 Prominent Investors Leading Angel Groups Venture Capital Firms & Private Equity Funds A Limited Number of Presenter Slots are still Available for Early and Later-Stage Companies Raising Capital Please Apply to Present by this Wednesday December 12th to Ensure Consideration Dear Amy: With our next funding venue coming-up on December 3rd I am writing to you again as we are always on the look-out for promising companies like Sony Pictures Entertainment that may resonate with the universe of Angels VCs Family Offices and other private investors who attend our well-established investment conferences. In today’s tight-money environment many good businesses from early to later-stage and middle-market are finding it difficult to obtain financing as their current banking and private investor relationships are no longer reliable funding sources. Companies see our ""investor-centric"" funding venues as a highly efficient and cost-effective alternative to hiring an Investment Banker or going on a Road Show to raise money. You can see a video from one of our events on the conference website at www.privateequityforums.com/index.html#!home/mainPage. This should give you a better sense of the venue as well as the high quality and dynamics of our prestigious conferences. In the event that you are all set with your funding requirements and existing capital sources just advise me by return e-mail with a notation to ""Delete"" in the subject line and I’ll be sure to take your e-mail address of amy_pascal@spe.sony.com off our list of potential Presenter candidates right away. (Kindly do not use all caps to ensure receipt.) Although we have not had a chance to speak about this event or your company's funding requirements kindly note that this correspondence is not part of a bulk mailing being delivered to you by a commercial e-mailing service and I have sent it to you personally on the basis of general research that our staff has undertaken on your company - based upon its industry sector and stage of operations. As this e-mail has not been sent to you by a commercial e-mailing service there is no remove button. The procedure that I have set forth in the paragraph below to be removed by using the Reply Feature is in compliance with the requirement to provide recipients with a visible and “easy-to-use” method to prevent a person from getting any more e-mails. If you are seeking capital and things are not going as quickly as you would like I wanted to let you know that we would be pleased to accept your application to present at our upcoming National Business Funding Conference being held in the Grand Ballroom of the Yale Club New York on Wednesday December 3rd. Your visibility at this unique event could quite possibly enhance your ability to accelerate the funding process with a view of raising capital within the next few months. These “deal-oriented” forums that we have been hosting for nearly 14 years are among the best investor-attended events of their kind in the U.S. During this period I believe that we have provided entrepreneurs with greater access to more investors than any other organization in the country. If you would like see what other business people have had to say about our national investor forums please go to http://www.privateequityforums.com/index.html# . By the way you may be interested in knowing that our organization was selected by Opportunist Magazine for a cover story in which I was interviewed. If you would like to read this article entitled “Connecting Investors and Entrepreneurs” which addresses capital raising and chronicles the reasons for the success of our business funding venues just go to http://opportunistmagazine.com/connecting-investors-and-entrepreneurs/#more-10605. Reserving Presenter Slot and Application Process - Please Call. Do Not Write: As a courtesy we can tentatively hold a Presenter slot for the company while you are considering this opportunity subject to your confirmation and a customary review of the company on our part. My direct line at our Connecticut office is 203 438 4411. I have found that a brief conversation first can save a great deal of time on the back-and-forth of e-mail exchanges and will give me the opportunity to better respond to your questions in the context of your capital needs and financial position. You are also welcome to send me your Executive Summary and I will call you back as soon as possible... Please be sure that any info you send to me includes the best phone number for me to reach you. Thanks. It is my pleasure to take whatever time is necessary to make a determination if the company would be a good fit for the event and help you to identify the points that would be most important for you to emphasize in your presentation to investors. Thanks for taking a few minutes to read this e-mail carefully as many of your questions will be answered and you will get a much better idea as to the value proposition has attracted so many companies to our events from all over the United States and other countries. There is no comparable funding venue in the United States to what we offer as measured by the number and quality of the active capital sources who attend our forums - not to mention the fact that we also reach out to investors for our entrepreneur participants and assist them in following-up after our event. Overview: This prestigious event could provide you with a highly effective opportunity to meet qualified investors and financial partners in what will also be a very prestigious setting. We expect principals from more than 100 active early and later-stage investment funds to attend from throughout the United States - representing more than $200 billion in capital. In addition many high net worth investors and a number of prominent angel groups will be joining us. In addition to the brand-equity of our venues the strong investor response to our recent events would indicate that there is no shortage of interest from investment funds and private investors who are looking for serious opportunities in promising early and later-stage companies. From our vantage point we can see there is a clear readiness to invest from many VCs private equity funds and Angels who understand that historically it is in times like these that the best investment opportunities are available. Very Important Regarding Fees: In the event that you are not already familiar with our venues kindly note our “principal differentiator” is that unlike most groups which organize deal-oriented events we are not part of any government agency or non-profit group nor are we primarily subsidized by paid sponsors i.e. vendors or service providers so as to not compromise our forums with a high population of non-investors such as lawyers accountants advisors recruiters and others offering services. Our private “investor-only” conferences could be best described as a co-op for the 15 to 20 Presenters and other featured companies. We underwrite the events and the entrepreneurs share in the cost (just like a trade show) the amount and terms of which we try to customize to a company’s particular financial situation. As a result companies are required to pay a fee to attend or present based upon a number of factors which may include a contingent or differed payment. How much is it? As every company differs with respect to its financial resources stage revenues and funding requirements we do not have a “one-size-fits-all” structure with respect to fees payment terms or visibility options and will do our best to get a qualified company on the conference program. Accordingly if you would like to find out what specifically your cost would be to present or attend please call me - as I will not know until I learn more about your company its funding requirements and any financial issues that you may be facing. Presenter Qualifications: The cornerstone of our events is to showcase promising early and later-stage companies which we believe are fundable and have the potential to be part of the next generation of emerging growth companies. With respect to the Presenter qualifications we for the most part feature post-revenue companies that have already had some meaningful Angel or “A” round VC funding. Although we prefer companies with some revenue we will also consider pre-revenue development-stage companies with new platform technology or some proof of concept so long as they are not raw un-funded start-ups and they have already had some initial outside funding. I would be pleased to discuss the participation options and costs when we have a chance to talk. One thing that you can be certain of is that any fees associated with presenting or attending our events are substantially less that than the costs of extensive travel to meet investors or the front-end fees and retainers charged by placement agents to reach the same caliber of investors who regularly attend our events. More information on general Presenter qualifications can be found on our website at www.privateequityforums.com/qualifications.html and www.privateequityforums.com/profiles.html. Please keep in mind that our events distinguish themselves from many other venues in several key respects as listed below: 1) Nearly 100% of the guests (not connected with the presenting companies) are active investors who have PAID to attend. 2) Presenting companies reach a NATIONAL audience of qualified funding sources focusing on early-stage opportunities. 3) Only 12 to 15 companies are featured on the program which provides for high visibility to investors. 4) The events are not primarily sponsor supported and accordingly NOT heavily populated with service providers. 5) There are no concurrent activities or competing presentations. All companies present to the entire audience. 6) Companies are never more than 10 to 20 minutes from their breakout sessions after they present. 7) These are “deal-oriented” events. There are no panels or other distractions that keep the spotlight from the presenters. 8) The majority of the attendees are PRINCIPALS of the private equity or venture capital firms whom they represent. 9) Presenters can plan for the forums in advance as we provide confirmed guest information prior to the conference dates. 10) Featured companies benefit from the strong brand equity that we have built with investors for more than 10 years. 11) Detailed contact information on all attending investors along with follow-up assistance is provided to entrepreneurs. 12) More than 5 hours networking time is provided to meet “one-on-one” with individual investors and venture capital firm partners. 13) Entrepreneurs have equal access to all investors who are NEVER separated in higher-priced VIP areas or functions within the venue. 14) Because the investors come from throughout the United States this exclusive forum is like a “Road Show” that comes to the company. 15) Presenters are provided with customized targeted introductions from a universe of several thousand investors among our prior guests. Our private equity forums started in 2001 are noted for a first-class venue and an ultra high-end roster of funding sources. These deal-focused symposiums have provided a remarkably beneficial venue for companies to reach a national audience of qualified potential investors. The management of presenting companies benefit from being able to get their story across to a receptive audience of investors in a very favorable upscale setting. Our experience has shown that the investor venue created through our forums can significantly reduce the cost of capital as well as the time necessary to raise it particularly in this current market with fewer active players for early-stage companies and tougher investment criteria. Our funding venues open a national portal to a audience of active investors. The upcoming venue can help you solve the three biggest problems in raising capital 1) identifying qualified investors 2) gaining credible entrée to them and 3) meeting them under favorable circumstances. Moreover the event drives the single most essential factor in getting funded quickly and that is the ability to create contemporaneous interest among investors - which also can serve to significantly improve deal terms. Again of particular importance is the fact that our events are not primarily supported by paid sponsors. As a result they are not heavily populated by service providers or vendors who would have no interest in investing in your company. Because we draw from all over the country this venue will be a less costly way for Presenters to meet investors from outside of their particular regions. You should also be aware that the majority of our guests are partners founders and managing directors of their respective firms; affording the featured companies a chance to reach senior people from the outset. Targeted Investor Outreach: If your company is selected to present M. J. Segal Associates can provide you with introductions to any of the firms listed on the conference website irrespective of their attendance at the upcoming event. As I previously mentioned companies can pay investment bankers up to several hundred thousand dollars in front-end fees and monthly retainers to gain access to these types of investment groups. Companies presenting at this forum gain the same entrée at only a small fraction of that cost notwithstanding the inherent efficiency of our highly-targeted venue. You can find a complete listing of our prior conference registrants organized by “Industry Sector Preferences” at http://www.starlightinvestments.com/?id=276. Presenter Qualifications: With respect to the Presenter qualifications again we favor companies with some revenues but will also consider pre-revenue development-stage companies with new platform technology or some proof of concept which has had some funding. Revenues forecast by the third year following funding should approach $15 to $20 million. Preferred industry sectors are Information Management Systems Enterprise Software Business Process Management Computer Technology Wireless Technology Social Media Telecommunications eCommerce Energy Technology Network Hardware and Software Healthcare Services Education & Training Medical Devices Manufacturing Technology New Media and Publishing Internet-Based Business Solutions Life Sciences Distance Learning Financial Services Consumer Marketing Specialty Retail Outsourced Business Services Cleantech Homeland Security and Supply Chain Management. Other sectors may also be considered with sufficient growth potential. If raising capital is the primary obstacle that stands in the way of moving your company forward you should seriously consider the visibility that we can provide at the upcoming event. As I am sure you are aware most professional investors will not even consider deals where they do not personally know management or those which have not been referred by a reliable source. Our forums significantly help to remove these barriers to management's power to reach qualified investors. Our upcoming event can provide the third-party endorsement and credibility which is so critical for getting funded in today’s market. We sincerely believe that if a company's potential is truly compelling and that management's vision can be effectively communicated; it will not find a more cost-effective way to reach potential funding sources directly than by presenting at the upcoming event. Again this is a unique opportunity to get your message across in “one place and in one day” to active serious investors who want to see fundable deals. Again if you would not like to receive any further information on upcoming conferences please let us know by return e-mail and your name will be promptly deleted from our distribution list. In this regard please provide us with any other e-mail addresses that you use to ensure that you receive no further communications from our office. We look forward to hearing from you and learning more about your funding requirements. Kindest regards Mike Segal President LinkedIn Profile: www.linkedin.com/in/mjsegal M. J. Segal Associates 531 Main Street - Suite 1116 New York New York 10044 Direct Line: 203 438 4411 www.privateequityforums.com About “So-Called” Free Events: Over the last almost 14 years we have clearly demonstrated as is true with most things in life “it is not what or if you pay but what you get for what you pay.” Please keep in mind that any investor venue (irrespective of its quality) that offers the opportunity to present for free is ONLY free for those who are selected from what is in most cases hundreds of companies that have applied. The odds are against you from the outset. And if you are NOT selected the fact that it was free to present made absolutely no difference - and you are back to the open-end costs of knocking on the doors of investors with little or no entrée. In many venues companies that are selected to present for free are then charged up to $1000 per person for each member of the management team who attends. So was it really free to present. Certainly not. Conferences of our class cost tens of thousands of dollars to produce. Accordingly someone has to pay for them - raising the questions are presenting companies at budget-priced or free venues getting real value? Are they talking to an audience of bona fide investors as is the case with our events or to seats that are full of vendors and service providers who have funded the venue? What is a free bag of potatoes worth if there are no potatoes in the bag? For those entrepreneurs who do not make the cut to present at ""so-called"" free events then they need to pay to be there - in most cases from about $700 to $1500 per person. We saw one “free to present if selected event” that was charging the “not chosen to present entrepreneurs” $4000 just to attend and get special VIP access to investors. To present at our events entrepreneurs are selected based upon their “individual merit” - not graded on a curve and do not need to win a competition based upon some subjective definition of ""The Best"". I wonder if Cisco Systems Amazon Google e-Bay or Starbucks would have made it through a presenter selection contest. Looking at the number of VCs who turned many of them down I would say probably not… We simply want to see qualified companies based upon reasonable criteria (such as scalability and proprietary advantage) which we believe are likely to resonate with a good percentage of our investors and are run by entrepreneurs who understand the prudence and wisdom of intelligently committing some dollars to accelerate their capital raising. Editorial Comment and Event Overview: In addition to the fact that our events are not heavily populated with vendors and service providers it is important to note that all of the entrepreneurs at our forums have an “equal opportunity” to personally engage with investors throughout the event; and are never relegated to being in a paid-for “Demo Pit” outside the main conference area with the hope of perhaps being selected to present for no fee. Every one of our visibility options irrespective of the cost guarantee entrepreneurs “full and easy access” to all of the capital sources attending as well as an extremely high profile at the event. At no time during our forums are any investors ever sequestered from entrepreneurs in private Vip areas or at our event functions such as the Luncheon and Dinner/Reception where a special high payment is required for corporate executives to gain access as is the case at certain other conferences. In fact the key element of our prestigious venues is that all entrepreneurs whether or not they are Presenters have a chance to get to know each of the Angels and Partners of the investment groups on a personal level which then opens the door to establishing your credentials and sharing management’s vision for the company. The agenda allows approximately 6 hours of unstructured time for socialization and networking which will give you an extended window to tell your story while forging relationships with the individual investors and principals of the VCs & private equity funds in attendance. Moreover companies participating at our events are NOT held hostage by the decisions of judges or sponsors as to whether or not they will have a chance to present since those arrangements are made prior to the venue. As a result our entrepreneurs will NEVER find themselves in a situation where they pay for one thing such as to be in a “Demo Pit” with the hope of getting a chance to present. In addition we do not have any Best of Show awards which can serve to de facto undermine the quality of those companies that do not win.

FW: Sony Pictures / SF Bio - Revised Agreement As uncompromising as they are on everything else it’s hard for me to want to agree on any proposal that comes from them. Whatever you guys want to do. From: Jan Stigwall (SF Bio) [mailto:Jan.Stigwall@sfbio.se] Sent: Friday November 15 2013 9:22 AM To: Gordon Jonathan Cc: Sherr Scott; ODell Steven; Sands Jay; Saberi Bijan; Gaynor Eric; Mats Larsson Subject: SV: Sony Pictures / SF Bio - Revised Agreement Dear All For your information SF Bio will open its new five screen complex Filmstaden Täby near Stockholm. The new complex is replacing Filmstaden Camera an old complex in the same but refurbished building and shopping mall. The new complex is situated on another floor approx 50-75 meters from the old complex. The projection systems in the old complex will be moved two at the time to the new complex meaning that for a short period (2-4 days) there will only be two screens open in the old complex and for another short period the neither the old nor the new complex will be open. The new complex will open November 29 when the old complex is completely closed. Due to the fact that we are using the old projection systems for four of the new screens we consider these projection systems as deployed under our VPF agreement. The new complex will consist of 5 screens in total i.e. there will be one new projection system installed in the new complex that is currently not covered by the VPF agreement. However to make future calculations easier we suggest that all five projection systems in the new complex shall qualify for VPF payments under the VPF agreement but that we for the Täby complex shorten the VPF payment period for a all five projection systems to expire October 11 2016. We hope that we can agree on what we believe is a practical solution and appreciate your comments to the above. Very Best Regards Janne Stigwall,Private

When we met in your office a few months ago we talked about a couple of things including THE CROWN (which we chased but Netflix outbid us…and the rest of the world!). We also talked about a project called THE VALLEY written by a writer under contract to Sony Tom Schnauz. I’m not sure you are aware but BBC America has put a firm 10 episode commitment on the table to Vuguru (who controls the property) and I would like to get Sony more engaged in the conversation. While our license fee offer is admittedly modest we are only seeking linear rights and I think there is a big upside for the other domestic (and international) revenue streams. Our latest original series ORPHAN BLACK is proving to be very profitable across all platforms and demonstrates that BBCA can successfully launch a high profile lucrative franchise.

I haven't heard back from Dan McCaffrey yet about the writer's assistant position I was so excited about but know I can excel anywhere inside of Sony.

"Amy As I do not believe that we have heard back from your office I am resending you the information that I had previously e-mailed about featuring Sony Pictures Entertainment at our next National Business Investment Conference being held on October 2nd in the Grand Ballroom of the Yale Club New York. Now in our 14th year with 50 consecutive fully-booked events behind us the primary objective of our well-established funding venues is to introduce promising companies to a national audience of more than 100 active early and later-stage investors who are looking for solid growth opportunities. If you would like to see what other entrepreneurs have to say about us just go to the References and Testimonials posted at http://www.privateequityforums.com/#!entre-test/crj5. More information on the upcoming event can be found at www.privateequityforums.com along with a video from one of our recent forums which is posted on the homepage on the site. The direct link to the video clip is www.youtube.com/watch?v=jm_Qg2pxHOM . Although we have not had a chance to speak about this event or your company's funding requirements kindly note that this correspondence is not part of a bulk mailing being delivered to you by a commercial e-mailing service and I have sent it to you personally on the basis of general research that our staff has undertaken on your company - based upon its industry sector and stage of operations. Of course we do not know the expansion plans of your company or its need for capital but are always on the lookout for companies with strong growth prospects which may resonate with our investors. As this e-mail has not been sent to you by a commercial e-mailing service there is no remove button. The procedure that I have set forth in the paragraph below to be removed by using the Reply Feature is in compliance with the requirement to provide recipients with a visible and ""easy-to-use"" method to prevent a person from getting any more e-mails. To be Taken Off our List of Potential Presenter Candidates: As I indicated in my previous e-mails if you are all set with your financing requirements or have other avenues to get funded just let me know via return e-mail by putting ""delete"" (using lower-case) in the subject line and I will be sure that your e-mail address of amy_pascal@spe.sony.com is taken off my list of potential Presenter candidates right away. It is our policy to act on such delete requests immediately upon receipt. I know the last thing that you need are more e-mails that are not currently relevant to your business... My sincerest apologies if you made a prior request which has not yet been processed or may not have gotten through to us for technical reasons. In the event that you are seeking capital and it is important to accelerate the process you may want to seriously consider being one of the 12 to 15 select Presenters at October 2nd event. This unique venue will give you a chance to get you story out to highly qualified audience of venture capital firms high net worth investors Angel Groups and private equity funds from all over the United States ""in one place and in one day"". Most companies see our events as a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to going on the road or hiring an investment banker. Our exclusive ""investor-only"" venues are not ""feel good"" events that have hundreds of people who for the most part are vendors and service providers but have few actual capital sources in attendance. This is in part because our deal-oriented conferences are not supported by paid sponsors charities non-profit groups or government agencies. Accordingly to participate companies do pay a fee to participate based upon a number of visibility options that we try to tailor to each company. This model of self-underwriting our events ensures presenting companies a very target-rich environment and a most favorable setting to raise capital in venue that is not compromised by a high population of non-investors. Please keep in mind that this prestigious venue can help you solve the three biggest problems in raising capital 1) identifying qualified investors 2) gaining credible entrée to them and 3) meeting them under favorable circumstances. Moreover the event drives the single most essential factor in getting funded quickly and that is the ability to create contemporaneous interest among investors - which also can serve to significantly improve deal terms. To Get the Presenter Application Process Started Please Call. Do Not Write - My direct line at our Connecticut office is 203 438 4411. I have found that a brief conversation first can save a great deal of time on the back-and-forth of e-mail exchanges and will give me the opportunity to better respond to your questions in the context of your capital needs and financial position. You are also welcome to send me your Executive Summary and I will call you back as soon as possible... Please be sure that any info you send to me includes the best phone number for me to reach you. Thanks... It is my pleasure to take whatever time is necessary to make a determination if the company would be a good fit for the event and help you to identify the points that would be most important for you to emphasize in your presentation to investors. What Does it Cost - As every company differs with respect to its financial resources stage revenues and funding requirements we do not have a ""one-size-fits-all"" structure with respect to fees payment terms or visibility options and will do our best to get a qualified company on the conference program. Accordingly if you would like to find out what specifically your cost would be to present or attend kindly call me at 203 438 4411 as I will not know until I learn more about your company its funding requirements and any financial issues that you may be facing. As we will be completing the Presenter roster shortly thank you for contacting me as soon as possible with respect to your interest in being on the program. More information about the event can be found online at www.privateequityforums.com/#!message/cq2w. In addition to see which investment groups that we can put in touch with in connection with the upcoming event just go online to www.starlightcapital.com/?id=276 and then click on the industry sector or sectors which are most applicable to your company. Again if you would not like to receive any further information on upcoming conferences please let us know by return e-mail with the word Delete in the subject line and your e-mail address of amy_pascal@spe.sony.com will be promptly taken off of our distribution list. In this regard please provide us with any other e-mail addresses that you use to ensure that you receive no further communications from our office. I look forward to hearing from you and learning more about your funding requirements. Kindest regards Mike Segal President www.linkedin.com/in/mjsegal www.privateequityforums.com M.J.Segal Associates 36 Sky Top Road Ridgefield CT 06877 Direct Line: 203 438 4411 Cover Article in ""Opportunist Magazine"" - In light of the recognition that we have received from the investment community and entrepreneurs seeking capital we are quite proud that our organization New York Private Equity Forums was selected by one of the leading business and investment publications Opportunist Magazine for the cover story in their December 13th 2011 issue for which I was interviewed. If you would like learn more about our history and value proposition you may want to read this article entitled ""Connecting Investors and Entrepreneurs"" which addresses capital raising and chronicles the reasons for the long-standing success of our funding venues just go to http://opportunistmagazine.com/connecting-investors-and-entrepreneurs/#more- 10605.",Private

I know that the phones are Sony's priority as well. I've been asked to have the design team focus on creating an über modern phone instead of focusing on an existing product. They are happy to do so. However instead of them just coming up with any design...is there any design direction they should follow? Is there anything about the placement that they should know about that would effect the design? Is there any specific function they should know about for the design? I know we need these phones immediately so any direction to cut some time is good. Do you want to throw out some potential dates that all of you would be available to meet so the electronics team can do a ""show-and-tell?"" They need some time to get ready plus the logistics of importing products so maybe later October? Let me know. Thanks everyone. -G.

We have used the term virtual MVPD to define non-facilities-based over-the-top (OTT) distributors of linear video programming as opposed t o companies such as Comcast and DirecTV which are facilities-based MVPDs. Our mistake has been that MVPDs under current FCC rules cannot be virtual they are required to be facilities-based. While we were clearly early in our predication that a virtual MVPD would emerge the stage appears set for them to begin to roll-out over the next 6-9 months led by DISH and Sony. What is an MVPD? (Multichannel Video Programming Distributor) The Communications Act of 1934 cites the need for MVPDs to “use public rights of way” to distribute linear video programming which over-the-top video distributors of linear programming clearly do not.

Mayhem is keen to hear more about SPE's creative restructuring particularly the alliances being made with Tom Rothman Michael De Luca and Jeff Robinov and would welcome an opportunity to hear more from SPE on their respective slate plans. Their preference is to have a Term Sheet with a studio that is a brief concise business contract. If possible we would ask SPE to prioritize the responses on the strategic asks. Acceptance of these asks will allow us to include SPE as a pre-approved studio under our investor arrangements. Please let us know if we have any questions.

Dinosaur Toy Story for Sony Dear Amy & Hannah This is the best pitch ever and it's so easy to visualize the movie. The parents who designed this for their young girls are brilliant so they have to be paid for this; they are going to be co-producers on it with me and they are getting a co-story credit. This is Dinosaur Toy Story it will be computer animated toy dinosaurs on the loose in suburbia and these great photos below tell the whole story. The parents will be very excited. I have to be a producer on this and I will expand the story with the dad & mom. You can then hire any writer you want to do the script and this movie will get made fast. I need an offer on Monday morning and I will guarantee you the rights it's an instant family franchise. The movie will be live-action with real families only the toy dinosaurs are CGI it's an easy movie to do: http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-07/11/9/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-buzz-13485-1405085639-7.jpg With my thanks.

FW amy_pascal@spe.sony.comShouldn't we be making voting easier? http://www2.myngp.com/Uploads/1284/images/Logo.jpg Friend I wanted to make sure you didn’t miss this message from Perry. We are fortunate to have the right and privilege to vote in this country. It is a right that has been guaranteed by patriots going back to the Founding Fathers. But politicians in Tallahassee do not want people to vote. Rick Scott and Pam Bondi want to manipulate the system so that they can win elections. It’s wrong and we shouldn’t let them get away with it. We can’t wait until September and October. We need to make sure we have a fair election NOW. Sign our petition to expand early voting TODAY! Best Zachary Meunier P.S. And seriously read Perry’s e-mail below if you haven’t. His commitment to elections where all citizens can participate regardless of age income race or sexual orientation is second to none. Then sign our petition: https://act.myngp.com/Forms/-4933269620719089920 _____ TO: FW amy_pascal@spe.sony.com FROM: Perry Thurston SUBJECT: Shouldn't we be making voting easier? Dear Friend There is no right in our democracy more basic than the right to vote. Throughout America’s history we have judged progress by granting voting rights and making it easier for citizens to participate in our great democracy. We granted voting rights to people of color women and then decided that if you are old enough to go to war you are old enough to vote. We’ve tried to make it easier to participate. We established absentee voting and early voting so that all citizens can have their voice heard. But unfortunately there is a new movement in America to put up barriers to make it harder to vote. And sadly it has its believers in Florida. Governor Scott has reduced early voting hours purged voter rolls until a federal court told him to stop and made it harder to register people to vote so they can participate in our democracy. One teacher faced thousands in fines for trying to register her students! Call on Governor Scott and Pam Bondi to extend early voting this year and tell them we should be making it easier to vote not harder. We have seen first-hand what happens when our politicians make it harder instead of easier to vote. In 2012 the governor reduced early voting hours and the number of early voting locations. Voters had to wait past midnight to vote. It was tragedy for our democracy and an embarrassment for our state. But it is no secret why Rick Scott and Pam Bondi want to make it harder for people to vote. They know that when people go to the polls they lose. They have already tried to do it again this year. It’s wrong and we must change it. Tell Governor Scott and Pam Bondi it is their obligation to serve the citizens’ interests not their own political interests. The right to vote is an incredible thing. All over the world people yearn for the right we take for granted – to choose our own leaders and hold them accountable. Together we can and we will protect it. Thanks for all you do Perry Thurston Copyright (C) 2014 Perry Thurston for Attorney General All rights reserved. Political Ad,Private

Deadline: Sony Eyeing Michael Fassbender For Steve Jobs? By Mike Fleming JrNovember 4 2014 I’m hearing that Michael Fassbender is the actor who’s currently being eyed to play Steve Jobs in the Aaron Sorkin-scripted picture that Danny Boyle will direct for Sony Pictures. I don’t want to get carried away here after all the heated press speculation about past courtship of other actors. But it does look like space can be made in Fassbender’s X-Men schedule to accommodate Sony’s hopes to get this into production in the winter. And he certainly has the chops. Stay tuned.

This draft envisions a scenario in which the SEC informally asks for our view of the matter and we advocate Sony’s affirmative themes at a high level. Thus the draft is naturally designed to argue -- and accentuate -- our strong points without dwelling on potential weaknesses. Although this presentation is formatted in Powerpoint (as recommended in a recent call) it is not something we are proposing to show or hand out to the SEC. Please also note that we would lead with only the talking points set forth in the first three substantive slides which largely concern DMG. The additional slides would be used purely on a reactive basis if we are asked about particular issues that the SEC has never previously mentioned.
